TEXT:  I could not have put in fewer, or more inclusive words, the definition of what half my future life was to be spent in discoursing of; while the nom-de-plume I chose, 'According to Nature,' was equally expressive of the temper in which I was to discourse alike on that, and every other subject., NR: 13, Book ID: The Poetry of Architecture by John Ruskin, Processed Text: could put inclus word definit half futur life wa spent plume chose accord natur wa equal express temper wa discours alik everi subject
TEXT:  The adoption of a nom-de-plume at all implied (as also the concealment of name on the first publication of 'Modern Painters') a sense of a power of judgment in myself, which it would not have been becoming in a youth of eighteen to claim., NR: 14, Book ID: The Poetry of Architecture by John Ruskin, Processed Text: adopt plume also conceal name first public modern painter sens power judgment would becom youth eighteen claim
TEXT: ..." "As it is, these youthful essays, though deformed by assumption, and shallow in contents, are curiously right up to the points they reach; and already distinguished above most of the literature of the time, for the skill of language, which the public at once felt for a pleasant gift in me., NR: 15, Book ID: The Poetry of Architecture by John Ruskin, Processed Text: youth essay though deform assumpt shallow content curious right point reach alreadi distinguish literatur time skill languag public felt pleasant gift
TEXT: " (Præterita, vol. I. chap. 12.) In a paper on "My First Editor," written in 1878, Mr. Ruskin says of these essays that they "contain sentences nearly as well put together as any I have done since." The Conductor of the Architectural Magazine in reviewing the year's work said (December, 1838):—"One series of papers, commenced in the last volume and concluded in the present one, we consider to be of particular value to the young architect., NR: 16, Book ID: The Poetry of Architecture by John Ruskin, Processed Text: vol chap paper first editor written ruskin say essay contain sentenc nearli well put togeth done sinc conductor architectur magazin year work said one seri paper last volum present one consid particular valu young architect
TEXT:  We allude to the 'Essays on the Poetry of Architecture,' by Kata Phusin.

TEXT:  They are addressed to the young and unprejudiced artist; and their great object is to induce him to think and to exercise his reason.... There are some, we trust, of the rising generation, who are able to free themselves from the trammels and architectural bigotry of Vitruvius and his followers; and it is to such alone that we look forward for any real improvement in architecture as an art of design and taste., NR: 18, Book ID: The Poetry of Architecture by John Ruskin, Processed Text: young unprejud artist great object induc think exercis reason trust rise gener abl free trammel architectur bigotri follow alon look forward real improv architectur art design tast
TEXT: " The essays are in two parts: the first describing the cottages of England, France, Switzerland, and Italy, and giving hints and directions for picturesque cottage-building. The second part treats of the villas of Italy and England—with special reference to Como and Windermere; and concludes with a discussion of the laws of artistic composition, and practical suggestions of interest to the builders of country-houses., NR: 19, Book ID: The Poetry of Architecture by John Ruskin, Processed Text: essay two part first cottag give hint direct picturesqu cottag build second part treat villa special refer discuss law artist composit practic suggest interest builder countri hous
TEXT:  It was the Author's original intention to have proceeded from the cottage and the villa to the higher forms of Architecture; but the Magazine to which he contributed was brought to a close shortly after the completion of his chapters on the villa, and his promise of farther studies was not redeemed until ten years later, by the publication of The Seven Lamps of Architecture, and still more completely in The Stones of Venice., NR: 20, Book ID: The Poetry of Architecture by John Ruskin, Processed Text: wa author origin intent cottag villa higher form architectur magazin wa brought close shortli complet chapter villa promis farther studi wa ten year later public seven lamp architectur still complet stone
TEXT:  Other papers contributed by Mr. Ruskin to the same Magazine, on Perspective, and on the proposed monument to Sir Walter Scott at Edinburgh, are not included in this volume, as they do not form any part of the series on the Poetry of Architecture., NR: 21, Book ID: The Poetry of Architecture by John Ruskin, Processed Text: paper ruskin magazin perspect monument sir walter includ volum form part seri poetri architectur

TEXT:  Loudon's engraver. THE EDITOR. INTRODUCTION. 1. The Science of Architecture, followed out to its full extent, is one of the noblest of those which have reference only to the creations of human minds. It is not merely a science of the rule and compass, it does not consist only in the observation of just rule, or of fair proportion: it is, or ought to be, a science of feeling more than of rule, a ministry to the mind, more than to the eye., NR: 25, Book ID: The Poetry of Architecture by John Ruskin, Processed Text: engrav editor introduct scienc architectur full extent one refer creation human mind mere scienc rule compass doe consist observ rule fair proport ought scienc feel rule ministri mind eye
TEXT:  If we consider how much less the beauty and majesty of a building depend upon its pleasing certain prejudices of the eye, than upon its rousing certain trains of meditation in the mind, it will show in a moment how many intricate questions of feeling are involved in the raising of an edifice; it will convince us of the truth of a proposition, which might at first have appeared startling, that no man can be an architect, who is not a metaphysician., NR: 26, Book ID: The Poetry of Architecture by John Ruskin, Processed Text: consid much less beauti majesti build depend upon pleas certain prejudic eye upon rous certain train medit mind show moment mani intric question feel involv rais edific convinc truth proposit might first startl man architect metaphysician
TEXT:  2. To the illustration of the department of this noble science which may be designated the Poetry of Architecture, this and some future articles will be dedicated. It is this peculiarity of the art which constitutes its nationality; and it will be found as interesting as it is useful, to trace in the distinctive characters of the architecture of nations, not only its adaptation to the situation and climate in which it has arisen, but its strong similarity to, and connection with, the prevailing turn of mind by which the nation who first employed it is distinguished., NR: 27, Book ID: The Poetry of Architecture by John Ruskin, Processed Text: illustr depart nobl scienc may poetri architectur futur articl peculiar art nation found interest use trace distinct charact architectur nation adapt situat climat ha arisen strong similar connect turn mind nation first employ distinguish
TEXT:  3. I consider the task I have imposed upon myself the more necessary, because this department of the science, perhaps regarded by some who have no ideas beyond stone and mortar as chimerical, and by others who think nothing necessary but truth and proportion as useless, is at a miserably low ebb in England., NR: 28, Book ID: The Poetry of Architecture by John Ruskin, Processed Text: consid task upon necessari depart scienc perhap idea beyond stone mortar chimer think noth necessari truth proport useless miser low ebb
TEXT:  And what is the consequence? We have Corinthian columns placed beside pilasters of no order at all, surmounted by monstrosified pepper-boxes, Gothic in form and Grecian in detail, in a building nominally and peculiarly "National"; we have Swiss cottages, falsely and calumniously so entitled, dropped in the brick-fields round the metropolis; and we have staring square-windowed, flat-roofed gentlemen's seats, of the lath and plaster, mock-magnificent, Regent's Park description, rising on the woody promontories of Derwentwater., NR: 29, Book ID: The Poetry of Architecture by John Ruskin, Processed Text: consequ column besid pilast order surmount pepper box form detail build nomin peculiarli nation swiss cottag fals calumni brick field round metropoli stare squar flat gentleman seat lath plaster mock magnific regent park descript rise woodi promontori
TEXT:  4. How deeply is it to be regretted, how much is it to be wondered at, that, in a country whose school of painting, though degraded by its system of meretricious coloring, and disgraced by hosts of would-be imitators of inimitable individuals, is yet raised by the distinguished talent of those individuals to a place of well-deserved honor; and the studios of whose sculptors are filled with designs of the most pure simplicity, and most perfect animation; the school of architecture should be so miserably debased! 5., NR: 30, Book ID: The Poetry of Architecture by John Ruskin, Processed Text: deepli much countri whose school paint though degrad system meretrici color host would imit inimit individu yet rais distinguish talent individu place well deserv honor studio whose sculptor fill design pure simplic perfect anim school architectur miser
TEXT:  There are, however, many reasons for a fact so lamentable. In the first place, the patrons of architecture (I am speaking of all classes of buildings, from the lowest to the highest), are a more numerous and less capable class than those of painting., NR: 31, Book ID: The Poetry of Architecture by John Ruskin, Processed Text: howev mani reason fact lament first place patron architectur speak class build highest numer less capabl class paint
TEXT:  The general public, and I say it with sorrow, because I know it from observation, have little to do with the encouragement of the school of painting, beyond the power which they unquestionably possess, and unmercifully use, of compelling our artists to substitute glare for beauty., NR: 32, Book ID: The Poetry of Architecture by John Ruskin, Processed Text: gener public say sorrow know observ littl encourag school paint beyond power unquestion possess unmerci use compel artist substitut glare beauti
TEXT:  Observe the direction of public taste at any of our exhibitions. We see visitors at that of the Society of Painters in Water Colors, passing Tayler with anathemas and Lewis with indifference, to remain in reverence and admiration before certain amiable white lambs and water-lilies, whose artists shall be nameless., NR: 33, Book ID: The Poetry of Architecture by John Ruskin, Processed Text: observ direct public tast exhibit see visitor societi painter water color pass anathema lewi indiffer remain rever admir certain amiabl white lamb water lili whose artist shall nameless
TEXT:  We see them, in the Royal Academy, passing by Wilkie, Turner and Callcott, with shrugs of doubt or of scorn, to fix in gazing and enthusiastic crowds upon kettles-full of witches, and His Majesty's ships so and so lying to in a gale, etc., NR: 34, Book ID: The Poetry of Architecture by John Ruskin, Processed Text: see royal academi pass turner shrug doubt scorn fix gaze enthusiast crowd upon kettl full witch majesti ship lie gale
TEXT: , etc. But these pictures attain no celebrity because the public admire them, for it is not to the public that the judgment is intrusted. It is by the chosen few, by our nobility and men of taste and talent, that the decision is made, the fame bestowed, and the artist encouraged., NR: 35, Book ID: The Poetry of Architecture by John Ruskin, Processed Text: pictur attain celebr public admir public judgment chosen nobil men tast talent decis made fame artist
TEXT:  6. Not so in architecture. There, the power is generally diffused. Every citizen may box himself up in as barbarous a tenement as suits his taste or inclination; the architect is his vassal, and must permit him not only to criticise, but to perpetrate., NR: 36, Book ID: The Poetry of Architecture by John Ruskin, Processed Text: architectur power gener diffus everi citizen may box barbar tenement suit tast inclin architect vassal must permit perpetr
TEXT:  The palace or the nobleman's seat may be raised in good taste, and become the admiration of a nation; but the influence of their owner is terminated by the boundary of his estate: he has no command over the adjacent scenery, and the possessor of every thirty acres around him has him at his mercy., NR: 37, Book ID: The Poetry of Architecture by John Ruskin, Processed Text: palac nobleman seat may rais good tast becom admir nation influenc owner boundari estat ha command adjac sceneri possessor everi thirti acr around ha merci
TEXT:  The streets of our cities are examples of the effects of this clashing of different tastes; and they are either remarkable for the utter absence of all attempt at embellishment, or disgraced by every variety of abomination., NR: 38, Book ID: The Poetry of Architecture by John Ruskin, Processed Text: street citi exampl effect differ tast either remark utter absenc attempt embellish everi varieti abomin
TEXT:  7. Again, in a climate like ours, those few who have knowledge and feeling to distinguish what is beautiful, are frequently prevented by various circumstances from erecting it. John Bull's comfort perpetually interferes with his good taste, and I should be the first to lament his losing so much of his nationality, as to permit the latter to prevail., NR: 39, Book ID: The Poetry of Architecture by John Ruskin, Processed Text: climat like knowledg feel distinguish beauti frequent variou circumst erect bull comfort perpetu good tast first lament lose much nation permit latter prevail
TEXT:  He cannot put his windows into a recess, without darkening his rooms; he cannot raise a narrow gable above his walls, without knocking his head against the rafters; and, worst of all, he cannot do either, without being stigmatized by the awful, inevitable epithet, of "a very odd man., NR: 40, Book ID: The Poetry of Architecture by John Ruskin, Processed Text: cannot put window recess without darken room cannot rais narrow gabl wall without knock head rafter worst cannot either without aw inevit epithet odd man
TEXT: " But, though much of the degradation of our present school of architecture is owing to the want or the unfitness of patrons, surely it is yet more attributable to a lamentable deficiency of taste and talent among our architects themselves., NR: 41, Book ID: The Poetry of Architecture by John Ruskin, Processed Text: though much degrad present school architectur owe want unfit patron sure yet attribut lament defici tast talent among architect
TEXT:  It is true, that in a country affording so little encouragement, and presenting so many causes for its absence, it cannot be expected that we should have any Michael Angelo Buonarottis. The energy of our architects is expended in raising "neat" poor-houses, and "pretty" charity schools; and, if they ever enter upon a work of higher rank, economy is the order of the day: plaster and stucco are substituted for granite and marble; rods of splashed iron for columns of verd-antique; and in the wild struggle after novelty, the fantastic is mistaken for the graceful, the complicated for the imposing, superfluity of ornament for beauty, and its total absence for simplicity., NR: 42, Book ID: The Poetry of Architecture by John Ruskin, Processed Text: true countri littl encourag mani caus absenc cannot energi architect rais neat poor hous pretti chariti school ever enter upon work higher rank economi order day plaster stucco substitut granit marbl rod splash iron column verd antiqu wild struggl novelti fantast mistaken grace complic impos superflu ornament beauti total absenc simplic
TEXT:  8. But all these disadvantages might in some degree be counteracted, all these abuses in some degree prevented, were it not for the slight attention paid by our architects to that branch of the art which I have above designated as the Poetry of Architecture., NR: 43, Book ID: The Poetry of Architecture by John Ruskin, Processed Text: disadvantag might degre abus degre slight attent architect branch art poetri architectur
TEXT:  All unity of feeling (which is the first principle of good taste) is neglected; we see nothing but incongruous combination: we have pinnacles without height, windows without light, columns with nothing to sustain, and buttresses with nothing to support., NR: 44, Book ID: The Poetry of Architecture by John Ruskin, Processed Text: uniti feel first principl good tast see noth incongru combin pinnacl without height window without light column noth sustain buttress noth support

TEXT:  9. I shall attempt, therefore, to endeavor to illustrate the principle from the neglect of which these abuses have arisen; that of unity of feeling, the basis of all grace, the essence of all beauty. We shall consider the architecture of nations as it is influenced by their feelings and manners, as it is connected with the scenery in which it is found, and with the skies under which it was erected; we shall be led as much to the street and the cottage as to the temple and the tower; and shall be more interested in buildings raised by feeling, than in those corrected by rule., NR: 46, Book ID: The Poetry of Architecture by John Ruskin, Processed Text: shall attempt therefor endeavor illustr principl neglect abus arisen uniti feel basi grace essenc beauti shall consid architectur nation feel manner connect sceneri found sky wa shall led much street cottag templ tower shall interest build rais feel correct rule
TEXT:  We shall commence with the lower class of edifices, proceeding from the roadside to the village, and from the village to the city; and, if we succeed in directing the attention of a single individual more directly to this most interesting department of the science of architecture, we shall not have written in vain., NR: 47, Book ID: The Poetry of Architecture by John Ruskin, Processed Text: shall commenc lower class edific proceed roadsid villag villag citi succeed attent singl individu directli interest depart scienc architectur shall written vain

TEXT:  I. THE LOWLAND COTTAGE—ENGLAND AND FRANCE. 10. Of all embellishments by which the efforts of man can enhance the beauty of natural scenery, those are the most effective which can give animation to the scene, while the spirit which they bestow is in unison with its general character., NR: 49, Book ID: The Poetry of Architecture by John Ruskin, Processed Text: lowland cottag embellish effort man enhanc beauti natur sceneri effect give anim scene spirit bestow unison gener charact
TEXT:  It is generally desirable to indicate the presence of animated existence in a scene of natural beauty; but only of such existence as shall be imbued with the spirit, and shall partake of the essence, of the beauty, which, without it, would be dead., NR: 50, Book ID: The Poetry of Architecture by John Ruskin, Processed Text: gener desir indic presenc anim exist scene natur beauti exist shall spirit shall partak essenc beauti without would dead
TEXT:  If our object, therefore, is to embellish a scene the character of which is peaceful and unpretending, we must not erect a building fit for the abode of wealth or pride. However beautiful or imposing in itself, such an object immediately indicates the presence of a kind of existence unsuited to the scenery which it inhabits; and of a mind which, when it sought retirement, was unacquainted with its own ruling feelings, and which consequently excites no sympathy in ours: but, if we erect a dwelling which may appear adapted to the wants, and sufficient for the comfort, of a gentle heart and lowly mind, we have instantly attained our object: we have bestowed animation, but we have not disturbed repose., NR: 51, Book ID: The Poetry of Architecture by John Ruskin, Processed Text: object therefor embellish scene charact peac unpretend must erect build fit abod wealth pride howev beauti impos object immedi presenc kind exist unsuit sceneri mind sought retir wa unacquaint rule feel consequ sympathi erect dwell may appear want suffici comfort gentl heart lowli mind instantli object anim disturb repos
TEXT:  11. It is for this reason that the cottage is one of the embellishments of natural scenery which deserve attentive consideration. It is beautiful always, and everywhere. Whether looking out of the woody dingle with its eye-like window, and sending up the motion of azure smoke between the silver trunks of aged trees; or grouped among the bright cornfields of the fruitful plain; or forming gray clusters along the slope of the mountain side, the cottage always gives the idea of a thing to be beloved: a quiet life-giving voice, that is as peaceful as silence itself., NR: 52, Book ID: The Poetry of Architecture by John Ruskin, Processed Text: reason cottag one embellish natur sceneri deserv attent consider beauti alway everywher whether look woodi dingl eye like window send motion azur smoke silver trunk age tree group among bright cornfield fruit plain form gray cluster along slope mountain side cottag alway give idea thing belov quiet life give voic peac silenc

TEXT:  The thatch is firmly pegged down, and mathematically leveled at the edges; and, though the martin is permitted to attach his humble domicile, in undisturbed security, to the eaves, he may be considered as enhancing the effect of the cottage, by increasing its usefulness, and making it contribute to the comfort of more beings than one., NR: 54, Book ID: The Poetry of Architecture by John Ruskin, Processed Text: thatch firmli peg mathemat edg though martin permit attach humbl domicil undisturb secur eav may consid effect cottag increas use make contribut comfort one
TEXT:  The whitewash is stainless, and its rough surface catches a side light as brightly as a front one: the luxuriant rose is trained gracefully over the window; and the gleaming lattice, divided not into heavy squares, but into small pointed diamonds, is thrown half open, as is just discovered by its glance among the green leaves of the sweetbrier, to admit the breeze, that, as it passes over the flowers, becomes full of their fragrance., NR: 55, Book ID: The Poetry of Architecture by John Ruskin, Processed Text: whitewash stainless rough surfac catch side light brightli front one luxuri rose train grace window gleam lattic divid heavi squar small point diamond thrown half open discov glanc among green leaf sweetbrier admit breez pass flower becom full fragranc
TEXT:  The light wooden porch breaks the flat of the cottage face by its projection; and a branch or two of wandering honeysuckle spread over the low hatch. A few square feet of garden and a latched wicket, persuading the weary and dusty pedestrian, with expressive eloquence, to lean upon it for an instant and request a drink of water or milk, complete a picture, which, if it be far enough from London to be unspoiled by town sophistications, is a very perfect thing in its way., NR: 56, Book ID: The Poetry of Architecture by John Ruskin, Processed Text: light wooden porch break flat cottag face project branch two wander honeysuckl spread low hatch squar foot garden wicket weari dusti pedestrian express eloqu lean upon instant request drink water milk complet pictur far enough unspoil town sophist perfect thing way

TEXT:  What then is the difference? There is a general air of nonchalance about the French peasant's habitation, which is aided by a perfect want of everything like neatness; and rendered more conspicuous by some points about the building which have a look of neglected beauty, and obliterated ornament., NR: 60, Book ID: The Poetry of Architecture by John Ruskin, Processed Text: differ gener air nonchal peasant habit perfect want everyth like neat conspicu point build look beauti ornament
TEXT:  Half of the whitewash is worn off, and the other half colored by various mosses and wandering lichens, which have been permitted to vegetate upon it, and which, though beautiful, constitute a kind of beauty from which the ideas of age and decay are inseparable., NR: 61, Book ID: The Poetry of Architecture by John Ruskin, Processed Text: half whitewash worn half color variou moss wander lichen permit veget upon though beauti constitut kind beauti idea age decay insepar
TEXT:  The tall roof of the garret window stands fantastically out; and underneath it, where, in England, we had a plain double lattice, is a deep recess, flatly arched at the top, built of solid masses of gray stone, fluted on the edge; while the brightness of the glass within (if there be any) is lost in shade, causing the recess to appear to the observer like a dark eye., NR: 62, Book ID: The Poetry of Architecture by John Ruskin, Processed Text: tall roof garret window stand fantast underneath plain doubl lattic deep recess flatli arch top built solid mass gray stone flute edg bright glass within lost shade caus recess appear observ like dark eye
TEXT:  The door has the same character: it is also of stone, which is so much broken and disguised as to prevent it from giving any idea of strength or stability. The entrance is always open; no roses, or anything else, are wreathed about it; several outhouses, built in the same style, give the building extent; and the group (in all probability, the dependency of some large old château in the distance) does not peep out of copse, or thicket, or a group of tall and beautiful trees, but stands comfortlessly between two individuals of the columns of long-trunked facsimile elms, which keep guard along the length of the public road., NR: 63, Book ID: The Poetry of Architecture by John Ruskin, Processed Text: door ha charact also stone much broken disguis prevent give idea strength stabil entranc alway open rose anyth els wreath sever outhous built style give build extent group probabl depend larg old chateau distanc doe peep cops thicket group tall beauti tree stand comfortlessli two individu column long trunk facsimil elm keep guard along length public road

Low, but long, hills sweep away for miles into vast uninterrupted champaigns; immense forests shadow the country for hundreds of square miles, without once letting through the light of day; its pastures and arable land are divided on the same scale; there are no fences; we can hardly place ourselves in any spot where we shall not see for leagues around; and there is a kind of comfortless sublimity in the size of every scene., NR: 67, Book ID: The Poetry of Architecture by John Ruskin, Processed Text: cottag therefor equal small equal shelter equal invis distanc countri larg scale low long hill sweep away mile vast uninterrupt champaign immens forest shadow countri hundr squar mile without light day pastur arabl land divid scale fenc hardli place spot shall see leagu around kind comfortless sublim size everi scene

TEXT:  Little is renewed: there is little spirit of improvement; and the customs which prevailed centuries ago are still taught by the patriarchs of the families to their grandchildren.

On the contrary, when the building is of such a class, that it can neither astonish by its beauty, nor impress by its sublimity, and when it is likewise placed in a situation so uninteresting as to render something more than mere fitness or propriety necessary, and to compel the eye to expect something from the building itself, a gentle contrast of feeling in that building is exceedingly desirable; and if possible, a sense that something has passed away, the presence of which would have bestowed a deeper interest on the whole scene., NR: 82, Book ID: The Poetry of Architecture by John Ruskin, Processed Text: build feel excit sentiment mere complac said good tast contrari build class neither astonish beauti impress sublim likewis situat uninterest render someth mere fit proprieti necessari compel eye expect someth build gentl contrast feel build exceedingli desir possibl sens someth ha away presenc would interest whole scene

The form of the roof, however, is always excessively flat, so as never to let it intrude upon the eye; and the consequence is, that, while an English village, seen at a distance, appears all red roof, the Italian is all white wall; and therefore, though always bright, is never gaudy., NR: 111, Book ID: The Poetry of Architecture by John Ruskin, Processed Text: gener tile deep curvatur rib distinct vertic line give far agreeabl surfac flatter tile form roof howev alway excess flat never let intrud upon eye consequ villag seen distanc red roof white wall therefor though alway bright never gaudi
TEXT:  We have in these roofs an excellent example of what should always be kept in mind, that everything will be found beautiful, which climate or situation render useful.

TEXT:  These long oblique shadows on the white surface are always delightful, and are alone sufficient to give the building character. They are peculiar to the buildings of Spain and Italy; for owing to the general darker color of those of more northerly climates, the shadows of their roofs, however far thrown, do not tell distinctly, and render them, not varied, but gloomy., NR: 113, Book ID: The Poetry of Architecture by John Ruskin, Processed Text: long obliqu shadow white surfac alway delight alon suffici give build charact peculiar build owe gener color northerli climat shadow roof howev far thrown tell distinctli render vari gloomi

TEXT:  Now, this simplicity is, perhaps, the principal attribute by which the Italian cottage attains the elevation of character we desired and expected.

Let it not be thought that we are wasting time in the contemplation of its beauties; even though they are of a kind which the architect can never imitate, because he has no command over time, and no choice of situation; and which he ought not to imitate, if he could, because they are only locally desirable or admirable., NR: 149, Book ID: The Poetry of Architecture by John Ruskin, Processed Text: think princip distinct attribut cottag let thought wast time contempl beauti even though kind architect never imit ha command time choic situat ought imit could local desir admir

The ornaments employed in the decoration of the Swiss cottage do not demand much attention; they are usually formed in a most simple manner, by thin laths, which are carved into any fanciful form, or in which rows of holes are cut, generally diamond shaped; and they are then nailed one above another to give the carving depth., NR: 190, Book ID: The Poetry of Architecture by John Ruskin, Processed Text: perhap cottag found equal none finish effect grace detail characterist whole ornament employ decor swiss cottag demand much attent usual form simpl manner thin lath fanci form row hole cut gener diamond shape one anoth give carv depth

Now, a considerable mass, of whatever tone or color it may consist, is as easily divisible by dots as by lines; that is, a conspicuous point, on any part of its surface, will divide it into two portions, each of which will be individually measured by the eye, but which will never make the impression which they would have made, had their unity not been interrupted., NR: 209, Book ID: The Poetry of Architecture by John Ruskin, Processed Text: anyth eye split part less whole undivid consider mass whatev tone color may consist easili divis dot line conspicu point part surfac divid two portion individu measur eye never make impress would made uniti interrupt

It should accordingly, in order to reconcile the attainment of the good, with the avoidance of the evil, be barely visible: it should not tell as a cottage on the eye, though it should on the mind; for be it observed that, if it is only by the closest investigation that we can ascertain it to be a human habitation, it will answer the purpose of increasing the solitude quite as well as if it were evidently so; because this impression is produced by its appeal to the thoughts, not by its effect on the eye., NR: 210, Book ID: The Poetry of Architecture by John Ruskin, Processed Text: conspicu cottag distant mountain side ha effect fatal degre therefor alway intoler accordingli order reconcil attain good avoid evil bare visibl tell cottag eye though mind investig ascertain human habit answer purpos increas solitud quit well evid impress produc appeal thought effect eye

Owing to their general greater elevation, it is relieved against the sky, instead of against a dark background, thereby losing the fine silvery blue,—which among trees, or rising out of a distant country, is so exquisitely beautiful,—and assuming a dingy yellowish black: its motion becomes useless; for the idea of stillness is no longer desirable, or, at least, no longer attainable, being interrupted by the nature of the building itself: and, finally, the associations it arouses are not dignified; we may think of a comfortable fireside, perhaps, but are quite as likely to dream of kitchens, and spits, and shoulders of mutton., NR: 267, Book ID: The Poetry of Architecture by John Ruskin, Processed Text: build higher class smoke ceas interest owe gener greater elev reliev sky instead dark background therebi lose fine silveri blue among tree rise distant countri exquisit beauti assum dingi yellowish black motion becom useless idea still longer desir least longer attain interrupt natur build final associ dignifi may think comfort firesid perhap quit like dream kitchen spit shoulder mutton

TEXT:  This is somewhat remarkable and may serve as a proof:— First, of what we at first asserted, that chimneys which in any way attract notice (and if these had not, we should not have sketched them) were seldom to be imitated; that there are few buildings which require them to be singular, and none which can tolerate them if decorated; and that the architect should always remember that the size and height being by necessity fixed, the form which draws least attention is the best., NR: 309, Book ID: The Poetry of Architecture by John Ruskin, Processed Text: somewhat remark may serv proof first first chimney way attract notic seldom build requir singular none toler decor architect alway rememb size height necess fix form draw least attent best

It is utterly impossible to give rules for the attainment of these effects, since they are the result of a feeling of the proportion and relation of lines, which, if not natural to a person, cannot be acquired, but by long practice and close observation; and it presupposes a power rarely bestowed on an English architect, of setting regularity at defiance, and sometimes comfort out of the question., NR: 318, Book ID: The Poetry of Architecture by John Ruskin, Processed Text: utterli imposs give rule attain effect sinc result feel proport relat line natur person cannot acquir long practic close observ power rare architect set regular defianc sometim comfort question

For nationality is founded, in a great degree, on prejudices and feelings inculcated and aroused in youth, which grow inveterate in the mind as long as its views are confined to the place of its birth; its ideas molded by the customs of its country, and its conversation limited to a circle composed of individuals of habits and feelings like its own; but which are gradually softened down, and eradicated, when the mind is led into general views of things, when it is guided by reflection instead of habit, and has begun to lay aside opinions contracted under the influence of association and prepossession, substituting in their room philosophical deductions from the calm contemplation of the various tempers, and thoughts, and customs, of mankind., NR: 366, Book ID: The Poetry of Architecture by John Ruskin, Processed Text: preliminari observ necessari man peasant mark nation charact man educ refin nation great degre prejudic feel youth grow inveter mind long view confin place birth idea custom countri convers limit circl compos individu habit feel like gradual mind led gener view thing reflect instead habit ha begun lay asid opinion contract influenc associ prepossess substitut room philosoph deduct calm contempl variou temper thought custom mankind
TEXT:  The love of its country will remain with undiminished strength in the cultivated mind, but the national modes of thinking will vanish from the disciplined intellect. 98. Now as it is only by these mannerisms of thought that architecture is affected, we shall find that, the more polished the mind of its designer, the less national will be the building; for its architect will be led away by a search after a model of ideal beauty, and will not be involuntarily guided by deep-rooted feelings, governing irresistibly his heart and hand., NR: 367, Book ID: The Poetry of Architecture by John Ruskin, Processed Text: love countri remain undiminish strength cultiv mind nation mode think vanish intellect manner thought architectur affect shall find polish mind design less nation build architect led away search model ideal beauti involuntarili deep root feel govern irresist heart hand
TEXT:  He will therefore be in perpetual danger of forgetting the necessary unison of scene and climate, and, following up the chase of the ideal, will neglect the beauty of the natural; an error which he could not commit, were he less general in his views, for then the prejudices to which he would be subject, would be as truly in unison with the objects which created them, as answering notes with the chords which awaken them., NR: 368, Book ID: The Poetry of Architecture by John Ruskin, Processed Text: therefor perpetu danger forget necessari unison scene climat follow chase ideal neglect beauti natur error could commit less gener view prejudic would subject would truli unison object note chord awaken
TEXT:  We must not, therefore, be surprised, if buildings bearing impress of the exercise of fine thought and high talent in their design, should yet offend us by perpetual discords with scene and climate; and if, therefore, we sometimes derive less instruction, and less pleasure from the columnar portico of the Palace, than from the latched door of the Cottage., NR: 369, Book ID: The Poetry of Architecture by John Ruskin, Processed Text: must therefor build bear impress exercis fine thought high talent design yet offend perpetu discord scene climat therefor sometim deriv less instruct less pleasur columnar portico palac door cottag

TEXT:  The reason of this may at first appear somewhat obscure, but it will become evident, on a little reflection. Aristotle's definition of pleasure, perhaps the best ever given, is "an agitation, and settling of the spirit into its own proper nature;" similar, by the by, to the giving of liberty of motion to the molecules of a mineral, followed by their crystallization, into their own proper form., NR: 371, Book ID: The Poetry of Architecture by John Ruskin, Processed Text: reason may first appear somewhat obscur becom evid littl reflect definit pleasur perhap best ever given agit settl spirit proper natur similar give liberti motion molecul miner crystal proper form
TEXT:  Now this "proper nature," ὑπαρχουσαν φυσιν, is not the acquired national habit, but the common and universal constitution of the human soul. This constitution is kept under by the feelings which prompt to action, for those feelings depend upon parts of character, or of prejudice, which are peculiar to individuals or to nations; and the pleasure which all men seek is a kind of partial casting away of these more active feelings, to return to the calm and unchanging constitution of mind which is the same in all., NR: 372, Book ID: The Poetry of Architecture by John Ruskin, Processed Text: proper natur acquir nation habit common univers constitut human soul constitut kept feel prompt action feel depend upon part charact prejudic peculiar individu nation pleasur men seek kind partial cast away activ feel return calm unchang constitut mind
TEXT:  100. We shall, therefore, find that man, in the business of his life, in religion, war, or ambition, is national, but in relaxation he manifests a nature common to every individual of his race. A Turk, for instance, and an English farmer, smoking their evening pipes, differ only in so much as the one has a mouthpiece of amber, and the other one of sealing wax; the one has a turban on his head, and the other a night-cap; they are the same in feeling, and to all intents and purposes the same men., NR: 373, Book ID: The Poetry of Architecture by John Ruskin, Processed Text: shall therefor find man busi life religion war ambit nation relax manifest natur common everi individu race turk instanc farmer smoke even pipe differ much one ha mouthpiec amber one seal wax one ha turban head night cap feel intent purpos men
TEXT:  But a Turkish janissary and an English grenadier differ widely in all their modes of thinking, feeling, and acting; they are strictly national. So again, a Tyrolese evening dance, though the costume, and the step, and the music may be different, is the same in feeling as that of the Parisian guinguette; but follow the Tyrolese into their temples, and their deep devotion and beautiful though superstitious reverence will be found very different from any feeling exhibited during a mass in Notre-Dame., NR: 374, Book ID: The Poetry of Architecture by John Ruskin, Processed Text: janissari grenadi differ wide mode think feel act strictli nation even danc though costum step music may differ feel follow templ deep devot beauti though superstiti rever found differ feel mass dame

TEXT:  101. In our own country, for instance, there is not the slightest. Beginning at the head of Windermere, and running down its border for about six miles, there are six important gentlemen's seats, villas they may be called; the first of which is a square white mass, decorated with pilasters of no order, set in a green avenue, sloping down to the water; the second is an imitation, we suppose, of something possessing theoretical existence in Switzerland, with sharp gable ends, and wooden flourishes turning the corners, set on a little dumpy mound with a slate wall running all round it, glittering with iron pyrites; the third is a blue dark-looking box, squeezed up into a group of straggly larches, with a bog in front of it; the fourth is a cream-colored domicile, in a large park, rather quiet and unaffected, the best of the four, though that is not saying much; the fifth is an old-fashioned thing, formal, and narrow-windowed, yet gray in its tone, and quiet, and not to be maligned; and the sixth is a nondescript, circular, putty-colored habitation, with a leaden dome on the top of it., NR: 377, Book ID: The Poetry of Architecture by John Ruskin, Processed Text: countri instanc begin head run border six mile six import gentleman seat villa may first squar white mass decor pilast order set green avenu slope water second imit suppos someth possess theoret exist sharp gabl end wooden flourish turn corner set littl dumpi mound slate wall run round glitter iron pyrit third blue dark look box group straggli larch bog front fourth cream color domicil larg park rather quiet unaffect best four though say much fifth old fashion thing formal narrow yet gray tone quiet sixth nondescript circular putti color habit leaden dome top

Though, as we saw before, the gentleman has less national character than the boor, his individual character is more marked, especially in its finer features, which are clearly and perfectly developed by education; consequently, when the inhabitant of the villa has had anything to do with its erection, we might expect to find indications of individual and peculiar feelings, which it would be most interesting to follow out., NR: 384, Book ID: The Poetry of Architecture by John Ruskin, Processed Text: one word set south though saw gentleman ha less nation charact boor individu charact mark especi finer featur clearli perfectli educ consequ inhabit villa ha anyth erect might expect find indic individu peculiar feel would interest follow

Now, as to the situation of the cottage, we have already seen that great humility was necessary, both in the building and its site, to prevent it from offending us by an apparent struggle with forces, compared with which its strength was dust: but we cannot have this extreme humility in the villa, the dwelling of wealth and power, and yet we must not, any more, suggest the idea of its resisting natural influences under which the Pyramids could not abide., NR: 389, Book ID: The Poetry of Architecture by John Ruskin, Processed Text: zone howev oliv great luxuri cypress orang alo myrtl vine latter alway trellis situat cottag alreadi seen great humil wa necessari build site prevent appar struggl forc strength wa dust cannot extrem humil villa dwell wealth power yet must suggest idea resist natur influenc pyramid could abid

TEXT:  For the cottage enhances the wildness of the surrounding scene, by sympathizing with it; the villa must do the same thing, by contrasting with it. The eye feels, in a far greater degree, the terror of the distant and desolate peaks, when it passes down their ravined sides to sloping and verdant hills, and is guided from these to the rich glow of vegetable life in the low zones, and through this glow to the tall front of some noble edifice, peaceful even in its pride., NR: 393, Book ID: The Poetry of Architecture by John Ruskin, Processed Text: cottag wild surround scene sympath villa must thing eye feel far greater degre terror distant desol peak pass ravin side slope verdant hill rich glow veget life low zone glow tall front nobl edific peac even pride

TEXT:  108. The frequent occurrence of the arch is always delightful in distant effect, partly on account of its graceful line, partly because the shade it casts is varied in depth, becoming deeper and deeper as the grotto retires, and partly because it gives great apparent elevation to the walls which it supports., NR: 404, Book ID: The Poetry of Architecture by John Ruskin, Processed Text: frequent occurr arch alway delight distant effect partli account grace line partli shade cast vari depth becom grotto partli give great appar elev wall support

TEXT:  And this effect would not be obtained, as might at first appear, by intermingling trees of different kinds, at irregular distances, or wherever they chose to grow; for then the design and the foliage would be instantly separated by the eye, the symmetry of the one would be interrupted, the grace of the other lost; the nobility of the design would not be seen, but its formality would be felt; and the wildness of the trees would be injurious, because it would be felt to be out of place., NR: 411, Book ID: The Poetry of Architecture by John Ruskin, Processed Text: effect would might first appear tree differ kind irregular distanc wherev chose grow design foliag would instantli eye symmetri one would interrupt grace lost nobil design would seen formal would felt wild tree would injuri would felt place

TEXT:  Secondly. In all hill scenery, though there is increase of size, there is want of distance. We are not speaking of views from summits, but of the average aspect of valleys. Suppose the mountains be 10,000 feet high, their summit will not be more than six miles distant in a direct line: and there is a general sense of confinement, induced by their wall-like boundaries, which is painful, contrasted with the wide expatiation of spirit induced by a distant view over plains., NR: 433, Book ID: The Poetry of Architecture by John Ruskin, Processed Text: secondli hill sceneri though increas size want distanc speak view summit averag aspect valley suppos mountain foot high summit six mile distant direct line gener sens confin induc wall like boundari pain wide expati spirit induc distant view plain

Having considered the propriety of the approach, it remains for us to investigate the nature of the feelings excited by the villas of the Lago di Como in particular, and of Italy in general.

TEXT:  When a small piece of quiet water reposes in a valley, or lies embosomed among crags, its chief beauty is derived from our perception of crystalline depth, united with excessive slumber.

Now, one touch of white reflection of an object at the edge will destroy the whole illusion, for it will come like the flash of light on armor, and will show the surface, not the depth: it will tell the eye whereabouts it is; will define the limit of the edge; and will turn the dream of limitless depth into a small, uninteresting, reposeless piece of water., NR: 456, Book ID: The Poetry of Architecture by John Ruskin, Processed Text: touch sky bottom water disagre black clearer fear one touch white reflect object edg destroy whole illus come like flash light armor show surfac depth tell eye whereabout defin limit edg turn dream limitless depth small uninterest piec water

As soon as we get a sheet, even if only a mile across, we lose depth; first, because it is almost impossible to get the surface without a breeze on some part of it; and, again, because we look along it, and get a great deal of sky in the reflection, which, when occupying too much space, tells as mere flat light., NR: 458, Book ID: The Poetry of Architecture by John Ruskin, Processed Text: principl small piec water look much along surfac soon get sheet even mile across lose depth first almost imposs get surfac without breez part look along get great deal sky reflect much space tell mere flat light

We shall speak of the effect of the material presently; but the deprivation of apparent antiquity is dependent in a great degree on the color; and in Italy, where, as we saw before, everything ought to point to the past, is serious injury, though, for several reasons, not so fatal as might be imagined; for we do not require, in a building raised as a light summer-house, wherein to while away a few pleasure hours, the evidence of ancestral dignity, without which the château or palace can possess hardly any beauty., NR: 468, Book ID: The Poetry of Architecture by John Ruskin, Processed Text: pale color majesti build first disguis humbl materi secondli take away appear age shall speak effect materi present depriv appar antiqu depend great degre color saw everyth ought point past seriou injuri though sever reason fatal might requir build rais light summer hous wherein away pleasur hour evid ancestr digniti without chateau palac possess hardli beauti

With all, however, that can be alleged in extenuation of its faults, it cannot be denied that the stucco does take away so much of the dignity of the building, that, unless we find enough bestowed by its form and details to counterbalance, and a great deal more than counterbalance, the deterioration occasioned by tone and material, the whole edifice must be condemned, as incongruous with the spirit of the climate, and even with the character of its own gardens and approach., NR: 484, Book ID: The Poetry of Architecture by John Ruskin, Processed Text: howev extenu fault cannot stucco doe take away much digniti build unless find enough form detail counterbal great deal counterbal deterior tone materi whole edific must condemn incongru spirit climat even charact garden approach

TEXT:  From three to four hundred yards is a length which will display the elevation well, and will not become tiresome from continued monotony.

TEXT:  Now, this kind of rich and shadowy vista is found in its perfection only in England: it is an attribute of green country; it is associated with all our memories of forest freedom, of our wood-rangers, and yeomen with the "doublets of the Lincoln green;" with our pride of ancient archers, whose art was fostered in such long and breezeless glades; with our thoughts of the merry chases of our kingly companies, when the dewy antlers sparkled down the intertwined paths of the windless woods, at the morning echo of the hunter's horn; with all, in fact, that once contributed to give our land its ancient name of "merry" England; a name which, in this age of steam and iron, it will have some difficulty in keeping., NR: 606, Book ID: The Poetry of Architecture by John Ruskin, Processed Text: kind rich shadowi vista found perfect attribut green countri associ memori forest freedom wood ranger yeoman doublet green pride ancient archer whose art wa long breezeless glade thought merri chase kingli compani dewi antler path windless wood morn echo horn fact give land ancient name merri name age steam iron difficulti keep
TEXT:  153. This, then, is the first feature we would direct attention to, as characteristic, in the English villa: and be it remembered, that we are not speaking of the immense lines of foliage which guide the eye to some of our English palaces, for those are rather the adjuncts of the park than the approach to the building; but of the more laconic avenue, with the two crested columns and the iron gate at its entrance, leading the eye, in the space of a hundred yards or so, to the gables of its gray mansion., NR: 607, Book ID: The Poetry of Architecture by John Ruskin, Processed Text: first featur would direct attent characterist villa speak immens line foliag guid eye palac rather adjunct park approach build lacon avenu two crest column iron gate entranc lead eye space hundr yard gabl gray mansion
TEXT:  A good instance of this approach may be found at Petersham, by following the right side of the Thames for about half a mile from Richmond Hill; though the house, which, in this case, is approached by a noble avenue, is much to be reprehended, as a bad mixture of imitation of the Italian with corrupt Elizabethan; though it is somewhat instructive, as showing the ridiculous effect of statues out of doors in a climate like ours., NR: 608, Book ID: The Poetry of Architecture by John Ruskin, Processed Text: good instanc approach may found petersham follow right side half mile hill though hous case nobl avenu much bad mixtur imit corrupt though somewhat instruct show ridicul effect statu door climat like
TEXT:  154. And now that we have pointed out the kind of approach most peculiarly English, that approach will guide us to the only style of villa architecture which can be called English,—the Elizabethan, and its varieties,—a style fantastic in its details, and capable of being subjected to no rule, but, as we think, well adapted for the scenery in which it arose., NR: 609, Book ID: The Poetry of Architecture by John Ruskin, Processed Text: point kind approach peculiarli approach guid style villa architectur varieti style fantast detail capabl subject rule think well sceneri aros
TEXT:  We allude not only to the pure Elizabethan, but even to the strange mixtures of classical ornaments with Gothic forms, which we find prevailing in the sixteenth century. In the most simple form, we have a building extending round three sides of a court, and, in the larger halls, round several interior courts, terminating in sharply gabled fronts, with broad oriels, divided into very narrow lights by channeled mullions, without decoration of any kind; the roof relieved by projecting dormer windows, whose lights are generally divided into three, terminating in very flat arches without cusps, the intermediate edge of the roof being battlemented., NR: 610, Book ID: The Poetry of Architecture by John Ruskin, Processed Text: allud pure even strang mixtur classic ornament form find sixteenth centuri simpl form build extend round three side court hall round sever interior court sharpli front broad oriel divid narrow light channel mullion without decor kind roof reliev project dormer window whose light gener divid three flat arch without cusp intermedi edg roof battlement
TEXT:  Then we find wreaths of ornament introduced at the base of the oriels;[27] ranges of short columns, the base of one upon the capital of another, running up beside them; the bases being very tall, sometimes decorated with knots of flower-work; the columns usually fluted,—wreathed, in richer examples, with ornament., NR: 611, Book ID: The Poetry of Architecture by John Ruskin, Processed Text: find wreath ornament base oriel rang short column base one upon capit anoth run besid base tall sometim decor knot flower work column usual flute wreath exampl ornament
TEXT:  The entrance is frequently formed by double ranges of those short columns, with intermediate arches, with shell canopies, and rich crests above.[28] This portico is carried up to some height above the roof, which is charged with an infinite variety of decorated chimneys., NR: 612, Book ID: The Poetry of Architecture by John Ruskin, Processed Text: entranc frequent form doubl rang short column intermedi arch shell canopi rich crest portico carri height roof infinit varieti decor chimney
TEXT:  155. Now, all this is utterly barbarous as architecture; but, with the exception of the chimneys, it is not false in taste; for it was originally intended for retired and quiet habitations in our forest country, not for conspicuous palaces in the streets of the city; and we have shown, in speaking of green country, that the eye is gratified[29] with fantastic details; that it is prepared, by the mingled lights of the natural scenery, for rich and entangled ornament, and would not only endure, but demand, irregularity of system in the architecture of man, to correspond with the infinite variety of form in the wood architecture of nature., NR: 613, Book ID: The Poetry of Architecture by John Ruskin, Processed Text: utterli barbar architectur except chimney fals tast wa origin intend retir quiet habit forest countri conspicu palac street citi shown speak green countri eye gratifi fantast detail prepar light natur sceneri rich entangl ornament would endur demand irregular system architectur man correspond infinit varieti form wood architectur natur

TEXT:  All this corresponds with points of English character, with its humors, its independency, and its horror of being put out of its own way. 157. Again, it is a thoroughly domestic building, homely and cottage-like in its prevailing forms, awakening no elevated ideas, assuming no nobility of form., NR: 617, Book ID: The Poetry of Architecture by John Ruskin, Processed Text: point charact humor independ horror put way thoroughli domest build home cottag like form awaken elev idea assum nobil form
TEXT:  It has none of the pride, or the grace of beauty, none of the dignity of delight which we found in the villa of Italy; but it is a habitation of everyday life, a protection from momentary inconvenience, covered with stiff efforts at decoration, and exactly typical of the mind of its inhabitant: not noble in its taste, not haughty in its recreation, not pure in its perception of beauty; but domestic in its pleasures, fond of matter-of-fact rather than of imagination, yet sparkling occasionally with odd wit and grotesque association., NR: 618, Book ID: The Poetry of Architecture by John Ruskin, Processed Text: ha none pride grace beauti none digniti delight found villa habit everyday life protect momentari inconveni cover stiff effort decor exactli typic mind inhabit nobl tast haughti recreat pure percept beauti domest pleasur matter fact rather imagin yet sparkl occasion odd wit grotesqu associ
TEXT:  The Italian obtains his beauty, as his recreation, with quietness, with few and noble lines, with great seriousness and depth of thought, with very rare interruptions to the simple train of feeling. But the Englishman's villa is full of effort: it is a business with him to be playful, an infinite labor to be ornamental: he forces his amusement with fits of contrasted thought, with mingling of minor touches of humor, with a good deal of sulkiness, but with no melancholy; and therefore, owing to this last adjunct,[30] the building, in its original state, cannot be called beautiful, and we ought not to consider the effect of its present antiquity, evidence of which is, as was before proved, generally objectionable in a building devoted to pleasure,[31] and is only agreeable here, because united with the memory of a departed pride., NR: 619, Book ID: The Poetry of Architecture by John Ruskin, Processed Text: beauti recreat quiet nobl line great serious depth thought rare interrupt simpl train feel villa full effort busi play infinit labor ornament forc amus fit thought minor touch humor good deal sulki melancholi therefor owe last adjunct build origin state cannot beauti ought consid effect present antiqu evid wa prove gener objection build devot pleasur agreeabl unit memori depart pride
TEXT:  158. Again, it is a lifelike building, sparkling in its casements, brisk in its air, letting much light in at the walls and roof, low and comfortable-looking in its door.

TEXT:  159. Again, it is a regularly planned, mechanical, well-disciplined building; each of its parts answering to its opposite, each of its ornaments matched with similarity. The Italian (where it has no high pretense to architectural beauty) is a rambling and irregular edifice, varied with uncorresponding masses: and the mind of the Italian we find similarly irregular, a thing of various and ungovernable impulse, without fixed principle of action; the Englishman's, regular and uniform in its emotions, steady in its habits, and firm even in its most trivial determinations., NR: 622, Book ID: The Poetry of Architecture by John Ruskin, Processed Text: regularli mechan well build part opposit ornament similar ha high pretens architectur beauti rambl irregular edific vari uncorrespond mass mind find similarli irregular thing variou ungovern impuls without fix principl action regular uniform emot steadi habit firm even trivial determin

Here the eye is drawn into the investigation of particular points, and miniature details; just as, in comparing the English and Continental cottages, we found the one characterized by a minute finish, and the other by a massive effect, exactly correspondent with the scale of the features and scenery of their respective localities., NR: 623, Book ID: The Poetry of Architecture by John Ruskin, Processed Text: lastli size whole diminut villa south effect wa alway larg gener eye drawn investig particular point miniatur detail continent cottag found one minut finish massiv effect exactli correspond scale featur sceneri respect local
TEXT:  161. It appears, then, from a consideration of these several points, that, in our antiquated style of villa architecture, some national feeling may be discovered; but in any buildings now raised there is no character whatever: all is ridiculous imitation, and despicable affectation; and it is much to be lamented, that now, when a great deal of public attention has been directed to architecture on the part of the public, more efforts are not made to turn that attention from mimicking Swiss châlets, to erecting English houses., NR: 624, Book ID: The Poetry of Architecture by John Ruskin, Processed Text: consider sever point antiqu style villa architectur nation feel may discov build rais charact whatev ridicul imit despic affect much lament great deal public attent ha direct architectur part public effort made turn attent swiss chalet erect hous

TEXT:  A. The Simple Blue Country. 185. Now, the matter-of-fact business-like activity of simple blue country has been already alluded to. This attribute renders in it a plain palpable brick dwelling-house allowable; though a thing which, in every country but the simple blue, compels every spectator of any feeling to send up aspirations, that builders who, like those of Babel, have brick for stone, may be put, like those of Babel, to confusion., NR: 716, Book ID: The Poetry of Architecture by John Ruskin, Processed Text: simpl blue countri matter fact busi like activ simpl blue countri ha alreadi attribut render plain palpabl brick dwell hous allow though thing everi countri simpl blue everi spectat feel send aspir builder like brick stone may put like confus
TEXT:  Here, however, it is not only allowable, but even agreeable, for the following reasons:— 186. Its cleanness and freshness of color, admitting of little dampness or staining, firm in its consistence, not moldering like stone, and therefore inducing no conviction of antiquity or decay, presents rather the appearance of such comfort as is contrived for the enjoyment of temporary wealth, than of such solidity as is raised for the inheritance of unfluctuating power., NR: 717, Book ID: The Poetry of Architecture by John Ruskin, Processed Text: howev allow even agreeabl follow reason clean fresh color littl damp stain firm consist like stone therefor convict antiqu decay present rather appear comfort enjoy temporari wealth solid rais inherit unfluctu power

TEXT:  This is the first cause which, in this country, renders brick allowable. 187. Again, wherever the soil breaks out in simple blue country, whether in the river shore, or the broken roadside bank, or the plowed field, in nine cases out of ten it is excessively warm in its color, being either gravel or clay, the black vegetable soil never remaining free of vegetation., NR: 721, Book ID: The Poetry of Architecture by John Ruskin, Processed Text: first caus countri render brick allow wherev soil break simpl blue countri whether river shore broken roadsid bank field nine case ten excess warm color either gravel clay black veget soil never free veget

TEXT:  188. Another excellence in brick is its perfect air of English respectability. It is utterly impossible for an edifice altogether of brick to look affected or absurd: it may look rude, it may look vulgar, it may look disgusting, in a wrong place; but it cannot look foolish, for it is incapable of pretension., NR: 725, Book ID: The Poetry of Architecture by John Ruskin, Processed Text: anoth excel brick perfect air respect utterli imposs edific altogeth brick look affect absurd may look rude may look vulgar may look disgust wrong place cannot look foolish incap pretens

Affectation[37] never was, and never will be, a part of English character; we have too much national pride, too much consciousness of our own dignity and power, too much established self-satisfaction, to allow us to become ridiculous by imitative efforts; and, as it is only by endeavoring to appear what he is not, that a man ever can become so, properly speaking, our true-witted Continental neighbors, who shrink from John Bull as a brute, never laugh at him as a fool., NR: 728, Book ID: The Poetry of Architecture by John Ruskin, Processed Text: utmost effort highli gift junior gentleman attain distinct titl even honor ill upon awkward coxcomb affect never wa never part charact much nation pride much conscious digniti power much establish self satisfact allow becom ridicul imit effort appear man ever becom properli speak true wit continent neighbor shrink bull brute never laugh fool

TEXT:  190. Lastly. Brick is admirably adapted for the climate of England, and for the frequent manufacturing nuisances of English blue country: for the smoke, which makes marble look like charcoal, and stucco like mud, only renders brick less glaring in its color; and the inclement climate, which makes the composition front look as if its architect had been amusing himself by throwing buckets of green water down from the roof, and before which the granite base of Stirling Castle is moldering into sand as impotent as ever was ribbed by ripple, wreaks its rage in vain upon the bits of baked clay, leaving them strong, and dry, and stainless, warm and comfortable in their effect, even when neglect has permitted the moss and wall-flower to creep into their crannies, and mellow into something like beauty that which is always comfort., NR: 731, Book ID: The Poetry of Architecture by John Ruskin, Processed Text: lastli brick admir climat frequent nuisanc blue countri smoke make marbl look like charcoal stucco like mud render brick less glare color inclement climat make composit front look architect amus throw bucket green water roof granit base castl sand impot ever wa rib rippl rage vain upon bit bake clay leav strong dri stainless warm comfort effect even neglect ha permit moss wall flower creep cranni mellow someth like beauti alway comfort

TEXT:  First. The brick should neither be of the white, nor the very dark red, kind. The white is worse than useless as a color: its cold, raw, sandy neutral has neither warmth enough to relieve, nor gray enough to harmonize with, any natural tones; it does not please the eye by warmth, in shade; it hurts it, by dry heat in sun; it has none of the advantages of effect which brick may have, to compensate for the vulgarity which it must have, and is altogether to be abhorred., NR: 734, Book ID: The Poetry of Architecture by John Ruskin, Processed Text: first brick neither white dark red kind white wors useless color cold raw sandi neutral ha neither warmth enough reliev gray enough harmon natur tone doe pleas eye warmth shade hurt dri heat sun ha none advantag effect brick may compens vulgar must altogeth

TEXT:  It is almost unnecessary to point out its fitness for a damp situation, not only as the best material for securing the comfort of the inhabitant, but because it will the sooner contract a certain degree of softness of tone, occasioned by microscopic vegetation, which will leave no more brick-red than is agreeable to the feelings where the atmosphere is chill., NR: 737, Book ID: The Poetry of Architecture by John Ruskin, Processed Text: almost unnecessari point fit damp situat best materi comfort inhabit sooner contract certain degre soft tone microscop veget leav brick red agreeabl feel atmospher chill
TEXT:  192. Secondly. Even this kind of red is a very powerful color; and as, in combination with the other primitive colors, very little of it will complete the light, so, very little will answer every purpose in landscape composition, and every addition, above that little, will be disagreeable., NR: 738, Book ID: The Poetry of Architecture by John Ruskin, Processed Text: secondli even kind red power color combin primit color littl complet light littl answer everi purpos landscap composit everi addit littl disagre

TEXT:  Besides, as a general principle, contrasts of extensive color are to be avoided in all buildings, and especially in positive and unmanageable tints. It is difficult to imagine whence the custom of putting stone ornaments into brick buildings could have arisen; unless it be an imitation of the Italian custom of mixing marble with stucco, which affords it no sanction, as the marble is only distinguishable from the general material by the sharpness of the carved edges., NR: 743, Book ID: The Poetry of Architecture by John Ruskin, Processed Text: besid gener principl contrast extens color build especi posit unmanag tint difficult imagin whenc custom stone ornament brick build could arisen unless imit custom marbl stucco sanction marbl distinguish gener materi sharp edg

The building must be either quite chaste, or excessively rich in decoration., NR: 785, Book ID: The Poetry of Architecture by John Ruskin, Processed Text: therefor present offer remark principl erect villa present day first build must either quit chast excess rich decor

TEXT:  The architect therefore, when limited as to expense, should content himself with making his oriels project boldly, channeling their mullions richly, and, in general, rendering his vertical lines delicate and beautiful in their workmanship; but, if his estimate be unlimited, he should lay on his ornament richly, taking care never to confuse the eye., NR: 787, Book ID: The Poetry of Architecture by John Ruskin, Processed Text: architect therefor limit expens content make oriel project boldli channel mullion richli gener render vertic line delic beauti workmanship estim unlimit lay ornament richli take care never confus eye
TEXT:  Those parts to which, of necessity, observation is especially directed, must be finished so as to bear a close scrutiny, that the eye may rest on them with satisfaction: but their finish must not be of a character which would have attracted the eye by itself, without being placed in a conspicuous situation; for, if it were, the united attraction of form and detail would confine the contemplation altogether to the parts so distinguished, and render it impossible for the mind to receive any impression of general effect., NR: 788, Book ID: The Poetry of Architecture by John Ruskin, Processed Text: part necess observ especi direct must finish bear close scrutini eye may rest satisfact finish must charact would eye without conspicu situat unit attract form detail would confin contempl altogeth part distinguish render imposs mind receiv impress gener effect
TEXT:  Consequently, the parts that project, and are to bear a strong light, must be chiseled with infinite delicacy; so that the ornament, though it would have remained unobserved had the eye not been guided to it, when observed, may be of distinguished beauty and power; but those parts which are to be flat and in shade should be marked with great sharpness and boldness, that the impression may be equalized., NR: 789, Book ID: The Poetry of Architecture by John Ruskin, Processed Text: consequ part project bear strong light must chisel infinit delicaci ornament though would unobserv eye may distinguish beauti power part flat shade mark great sharp bold impress may
TEXT:  When, for instance, we have to do with oriels, to which attention is immediately attracted by their projection, we may run wreaths of the finest flower-work up the mullions, charge the terminations with shields, and quarter them richly; but we must join the window to the wall, where its shadow falls, by means of more deep and decided decoration., NR: 790, Book ID: The Poetry of Architecture by John Ruskin, Processed Text: instanc oriel attent immedi project may run wreath flower work mullion charg termin shield quarter richli must join window wall shadow fall mean deep decid decor
TEXT:  206. Secondly. In the choice and design of his ornaments, the architect should endeavor to be grotesque rather than graceful (though little bits of soft flower-work here and there will relieve the eye): but he must not imagine he can be grotesque by carving faces with holes for eyes and knobs for noses; on the contrary, whenever he mimics grotesque life, there should be wit and humor in every feature, fun and frolic in every attitude; every distortion should be anatomical, and every monster a studied combination., NR: 791, Book ID: The Poetry of Architecture by John Ruskin, Processed Text: secondli choic design ornament architect endeavor grotesqu rather grace though littl bit soft flower work reliev eye must imagin grotesqu carv face hole eye knob nose contrari whenev mimic grotesqu life wit humor everi featur fun frolic everi attitud everi distort anatom everi monster studi combin
TEXT:  This is a question, however, relating more nearly to Gothic architecture and therefore we shall not enter into it at present.[41] 207. Thirdly. The gables must on no account be jagged into a succession of right angles, as if people were to be perpetually engaged in trotting up one side and down the other., NR: 792, Book ID: The Poetry of Architecture by John Ruskin, Processed Text: question howev nearli architectur therefor shall enter present thirdli gabl must account jag success right angl peopl perpetu engag one side
TEXT:  This custom, though sanctioned by authority, has very little apology to offer for itself, based on any principle of composition.

TEXT:  They should then be carried up in curved lines, alternating with two angles, or three at the most, without pinnacles or hipknobs. A hollow parapet is far better than a battlement, in the intermediate spaces; the latter indeed is never allowable, except when the building has some appearance of being intended for defense, and therefore is generally barbarous in the villa; while the parapet admits of great variety of effect., NR: 794, Book ID: The Poetry of Architecture by John Ruskin, Processed Text: carri curv line altern two angl three without pinnacl hollow parapet far better battlement intermedi space latter inde never allow except build ha appear intend defens therefor gener barbar villa parapet great varieti effect
TEXT:  208. Lastly. Though the grotesque of Elizabethan architecture is adapted for wood country, the grotesque of the clipped garden, which frequently accompanies it, is not. The custom of clipping trees into fantastic forms is always to be reprehended: first, because it never can produce the true grotesque, for the material is not passive, and, therefore, a perpetual sense of restraint is induced, while the great principle of the grotesque is action; again, because we have a distinct perception of two natures, the one neutralizing the other; for the vegetable organization is too palpable to let the animal form suggest its true idea; again, because the great beauty of all foliage is the energy of life and action, of which it loses the appearance by formal clipping; and again, because the hands of the gardener will never produce anything really spirited or graceful., NR: 795, Book ID: The Poetry of Architecture by John Ruskin, Processed Text: lastli though grotesqu architectur wood countri grotesqu clip garden frequent custom clip tree fantast form alway first never produc true grotesqu materi passiv therefor perpetu sens restraint induc great principl grotesqu action distinct percept two natur one veget organ palpabl let anim form suggest true idea great beauti foliag energi life action appear formal clip hand garden never produc anyth realli spirit grace
TEXT:  Much, however, need not be said on this subject; for the taste of the public does not now prompt them to such fettering of fair freedom, and we should be as sorry to see the characteristic vestiges of it, which still remain in a few gardens, lost altogether, as to see the thing again becoming common., NR: 796, Book ID: The Poetry of Architecture by John Ruskin, Processed Text: much howev need said subject tast public doe prompt fair freedom sorri see characterist vestig still remain garden lost altogeth see thing becom common
TEXT:  209. The garden of the Elizabethan villa, then, should be laid out with a few simple terraces near the house, so as to unite it well with the ground; lines of balustrade along the edges, guided away into the foliage of the taller trees of the garden, with the shadows falling at intervals., NR: 797, Book ID: The Poetry of Architecture by John Ruskin, Processed Text: garden villa laid simpl terrac near hous unit well ground line balustrad along edg away foliag taller tree garden shadow fall interv
TEXT:  The balusters should be square rather than round, with the angles outward; and if the balustrade looks unfinished at the corners, it may be surmounted by a grotesque bit of sculpture, of any kind; but it must be very strong and deep in its carved lines, and must not be large; and all graceful statues are to be avoided, for the reasons mentioned in speaking of the Italian villa: neither is the terraced part of the garden to extend to any distance from the house, nor to have deep flights of steps, for they are sure to get mossy and slippery, if not superintended with troublesome care; and the rest of the garden should have more trees than flowers in it., NR: 798, Book ID: The Poetry of Architecture by John Ruskin, Processed Text: balust squar rather round angl outward balustrad look unfinish corner may surmount grotesqu bit sculptur kind must strong deep line must larg grace statu reason speak villa neither part garden extend distanc hous deep flight step sure get mossi slipperi troublesom care rest garden tree flower
TEXT:  A flower-garden is an ugly thing, even when best managed: it is an assembly of unfortunate beings, pampered and bloated above their natural size, stewed and heated into diseased growth; corrupted by evil communication into speckled and inharmonious colors; torn from the soil which they loved, and of which they were the spirit and the glory, to glare away their term of tormented life among the mixed and incongruous essences of each other, in earth that they know not, and in air that is poison to them., NR: 799, Book ID: The Poetry of Architecture by John Ruskin, Processed Text: flower garden ugli thing even best assembl unfortun pamper bloat natur size stew diseas growth corrupt evil commun speckl inharmoni color torn soil spirit glori glare away term torment life among mix incongru essenc earth know air poison

He who has taken lessons from nature, who has observed the real purpose and operation of flowers; how they flush forth from the brightness of the earth's being, as the melody rises up from among the moved strings of the instrument; how the wildness of their pale colors passes over her, like the evidence of a various emotion; how the quick fire of their life and their delight glows along the green banks, where the dew falls the thickest, and the mists of incense pass slowly through the twilight of the leaves, and the intertwined roots make the earth tremble with strange joy at the feeling of their motion; he who has watched this will never take away the beauty of their being to mix into meretricious glare, or feed into an existence of disease., NR: 800, Book ID: The Poetry of Architecture by John Ruskin, Processed Text: florist may delight true lover flower never ha taken lesson natur ha real purpos oper flower flush forth bright earth melodi rise among string instrument wild pale color pass like evid variou emot quick fire life delight glow along green bank dew fall mist incens slowli twilight leaf root make earth trembl strang joy feel motion ha watch never take away beauti mix meretrici glare feed exist diseas
TEXT:  And the flower-garden is as ugly in effect as it is unnatural in feeling: it never will harmonize with anything, and if people will have it, should be kept out of sight till they get into it. 211.

The first thing, then, which the architect has to do in hill country is to bring his employer down from heroics to common sense; to teach him that, although it might be very well for a man like Pliny,[44] whose whole spirit and life was wrapt up in that of Nature, to set himself down under the splash of a cascade 400 feet high, such escapades are not becoming in English gentlemen; and that it is necessary, for his own satisfaction, as well as that of others, that he should keep in the most quiet and least pretending corners of the landscape which he has chosen., NR: 828, Book ID: The Poetry of Architecture by John Ruskin, Processed Text: yet far better sustain pleasur impress first thing architect ha hill countri bring employ heroic common sens teach although might well man like whose whole spirit life wa natur set splash cascad foot high escapad becom gentleman necessari satisfact well keep quiet least corner landscap ha chosen

When an object, in which magnitude is a desirable attribute, leaves an impression, on a practiced eye, of less magnitude than it really possesses, we should place objects beside it, of whose magnitude we can satisfy ourselves, of larger size than that which we are accustomed to; for, by finding these large objects in precisely the proportion to the grand object, to which we are accustomed, while we know their actual size to be one to which we are not accustomed, we become aware of the true magnitude of the principal feature., NR: 840, Book ID: The Poetry of Architecture by John Ruskin, Processed Text: disadvantag may degre shall see simplic architectur anoth depend question proport inevit object magnitud desir attribut leaf impress practic eye less magnitud realli place object besid whose magnitud satisfi size accustom find larg object precis proport grand object accustom know actual size one accustom becom awar true magnitud princip featur

For these reasons, buildings of a very large size are decidedly destructive of effect among the English lakes: first, because apparent altitudes are much diminished by them; and, secondly, because, whatever position they may be placed in, instead of combining with scenery, they occupy and overwhelm it; for all scenery is divided into pieces, each of which has a near bit of beauty, a promontory of lichened crag, or a smooth swarded knoll, or something of the kind, to begin with., NR: 846, Book ID: The Poetry of Architecture by John Ruskin, Processed Text: proport color question quit differ natur depend mere admixtur combin reason build larg size decidedli destruct effect among lake first appar altitud much secondli whatev posit may instead combin sceneri occupi overwhelm sceneri divid piec ha near bit beauti promontori lichen crag smooth knoll someth kind begin

TEXT:  234. Hence, we see the grand importance of the choice of our means of enhancing effect, and we derive the simple rule for that choice, namely, that, when we wish to increase abstract impression, or to call upon the sympathy of the spectator, we are to use contrast; but, when we wish to extend the operation of the impression, or to awaken the selfish feelings, we are to use assimilation., NR: 884, Book ID: The Poetry of Architecture by John Ruskin, Processed Text: henc see grand import choic mean effect deriv simpl rule choic name wish increas abstract impress call upon sympathi spectat use contrast wish extend oper impress awaken selfish feel use assimil
TEXT:  This rule, however, becomes complicated, where the feature of contrast is not altogether passive; that is, where we wish to give a conception of any qualities inherent in that feature, as well as in what it relieves; and, besides, it is not always easy to know whether it will be best to increase the abstract idea, or its operation., NR: 885, Book ID: The Poetry of Architecture by John Ruskin, Processed Text: rule howev becom complic featur contrast altogeth passiv wish give concept qualiti inher featur well relief besid alway easi know whether best increas abstract idea oper

TEXT:  235. It is impossible to give rules for judgment in every case; but the following points must always be observed:—First, when we use contrast, it must be natural and likely to occur.

TEXT: " This contrast, though natural in a Parisian, was unnatural in the nature of things, and therefore injurious. 236. Secondly, when the general influence, instead of being external, is an attribute or energy of the thing itself, so as to bestow on it a permanent character, the contrast which is obtained by the absence of that character is injurious, and becomes what is called an interruption of the unity., NR: 890, Book ID: The Poetry of Architecture by John Ruskin, Processed Text: contrast though natur wa unnatur natur thing therefor injuri secondli gener influenc instead extern attribut energi thing bestow perman charact contrast absenc charact injuri becom interrupt uniti

Thus, the elevation of character which the hill districts of Italy possess by the magnificence of their forms, is transmitted to the villa by its dignity of detail and simplicity of outline; and the rectangular interruption to the curve of picturesque blue country, partaking of the nature of that which it interrupts, is a contrast giving relief and interest, while any Elizabethan acute angles, on the contrary, would have been a contrast obtained by the absence of the pervading energy of the universal curvilinear character, and therefore improper., NR: 893, Book ID: The Poetry of Architecture by John Ruskin, Processed Text: thirdli pervad charact singl object differ mean contrast delight thu elev charact hill district possess magnific form villa digniti detail simplic outlin rectangular interrupt curv picturesqu blue countri natur interrupt contrast give relief interest acut angl contrari would contrast absenc pervad energi univers curvilinear charact therefor improp

Fourthly, when the general energy, instead of pervading simultaneously the multitude of objects, as with one spirit, is independently possessed and manifested by every individual object, the result is repetition, not unity; and contrast is not merely agreeable, but necessary., NR: 894, Book ID: The Poetry of Architecture by John Ruskin, Processed Text: fourthli gener energi instead pervad simultan multitud object one spirit independ possess manifest everi individu object result repetit uniti contrast mere agreeabl necessari
TEXT:  Thus, a number of objects, forming the line of beauty, is pervaded by one simple energy; but if that energy is separately manifested in each, the result is painful monotony. Parallel right lines, without grouping, are always liable to this objection; and, therefore, a distant view of a flat country is never beautiful unless its horizontals are lost in richness of vegetation, as in Lombardy, or broken with masses of forest, or with distant hills., NR: 895, Book ID: The Poetry of Architecture by John Ruskin, Processed Text: thu number object form line beauti one simpl energi energi separ manifest result pain monotoni parallel right line without group alway liabl object therefor distant view flat countri never beauti unless horizont lost rich veget broken mass forest distant hill

Of the ornament itself, it is to be observed that it is not to be what is properly called architectural decoration (that which is "decorous," becoming, or suitable to), namely, the combination of minor forms, which repeat the lines, and partake of the essence of the grand design, and carry out its meaning and life into its every member; but it is to be true sculpture; the presenting of a pure ideality of form to the eye, which may give perfect conception, without the assistance of color: it is to be the stone image of vegetation, not botanically accurate, indeed, but sufficiently near to permit us to be sure of the intended flower or leaf., NR: 936, Book ID: The Poetry of Architecture by John Ruskin, Processed Text: ornament properli architectur decor decor becom suitabl name combin minor form repeat line partak essenc grand design carri mean life everi member true sculptur pure ideal form eye may give perfect concept without assist color stone imag veget botan accur inde suffici near permit sure intend flower leaf

The question of color has already been discussed at some length, in speaking of the cottage; but it is to be noticed, that the villa, from the nature of its situation, gets the higher hills back into a distance which is three or four times more blue than any piece of scenery entering into combination with the cottage; so that more warmth of color is allowable in the building, as well as greater cheerfulness of effect., NR: 942, Book ID: The Poetry of Architecture by John Ruskin, Processed Text: much form question color ha alreadi length speak cottag villa natur situat get higher hill back distanc three four time blue piec sceneri enter combin cottag warmth color allow build well greater cheer effect
TEXT:  It should not look like stone, as the cottage should, but should tell as a building on the mind as well as the eye. White, therefore, is frequently allowable in small quantities, particularly on the border of a large and softly shored lake, like Windermere and the foot of Loch Lomond; but cream-color, and putty-color, and the other varieties of plaster-color are inexcusable., NR: 943, Book ID: The Poetry of Architecture by John Ruskin, Processed Text: look like stone cottag tell build mind well eye white therefor frequent allow small quantiti particularli border larg softli shore lake like foot loch cream color putti color varieti plaster color inexcus
TEXT:  If more warmth is required by the situation than the sun will give on white, the building should be darkened at once. A warm rich gray is always beautiful in any place and under any circumstance; and, in fact, unless the proprietor likes to be kept damp like a traveling codfish, by trees about his house and close to it (which, if it be white, he must have, to prevent glare), such a gray is the only color which will be beautiful, or even innocent., NR: 944, Book ID: The Poetry of Architecture by John Ruskin, Processed Text: warmth situat sun give white build warm rich gray alway beauti place circumst fact unless proprietor like kept damp like travel codfish tree hous close white must prevent glare gray color beauti even innoc

TEXT:  The simple forms may be executed in anything that will stand wet; and the roof, in all cases, should be of the coarse slate of the country, as rudely put on as possible.

TEXT:  An outward surface of a loose block may be often turned to good account in turning an angle; as the colors which it has contracted by its natural exposure will remain on it without inducing damp.

Of the mode of uniting it with the near features of foliage and ground, it would be utterly useless to speak: it is a question of infinite variety, and involving the whole theory of composition, so that it would take up volumes to develop principles sufficient to guide us to the result which the feeling of the practiced eye would arrive at in a moment., NR: 950, Book ID: The Poetry of Architecture by John Ruskin, Processed Text: princip point kept view edific mode unit near featur foliag ground would utterli useless speak question infinit varieti whole theori composit would take volum develop principl suffici guid result feel practic eye would arriv moment

The house must not be a noun substantive, it must not stand by itself, it must be part and parcel of a proportioned whole: it must not even be seen all at once; and he who sees one end should feel that, from the given data, he can arrive at no conclusion respecting the other, yet be impressed with a feeling of a universal energy, pervading with its beauty of unanimity all life and all inanimation, all forms of stillness or motion, all presence of silence or of sound., NR: 952, Book ID: The Poetry of Architecture by John Ruskin, Processed Text: one gener rule given repeat hous must noun substant must stand must part parcel proport whole must even seen see one end feel given data arriv conclus respect yet feel univers energi pervad beauti unanim life inanim form still motion presenc silenc sound

Thus, then, we have reviewed the most interesting examples of existing villa architecture, and we have applied the principles derived from those examples to the landscape of our own country. Throughout, we have endeavored to direct attention to the spirit, rather than to the letter, of all law, and to exhibit the beauty of that principle which is embodied in the line with which we have headed this concluding paper; of being satisfied with national and natural forms, and not endeavoring to introduce the imaginations, or imitate the customs, of foreign nations, or of former times., NR: 953, Book ID: The Poetry of Architecture by John Ruskin, Processed Text: thu interest exampl villa architectur appli principl deriv exampl landscap countri throughout direct attent spirit rather letter law exhibit beauti principl line head conclud paper satisfi nation natur form introduc imagin imit custom foreign nation former time

And, as we take leave of them, we would, once for all, remind our English sons of Sempronius "qui villas attollunt marmore novas," novas in the full sense of the word,—and who are setting all English feeling and all natural principles at defiance, that it is only the bourgeois gentilhomme who will wear his dressing-gown upside down, "parceque toutes les personnes de qualité portent les fleurs en en-bas., NR: 954, Book ID: The Poetry of Architecture by John Ruskin, Processed Text: imit ha origin vaniti vaniti bane architectur take leav would remind son villa nova nova full sens word set feel natur principl defianc bourgeoi wear dress gown upsid portent ba

It has often been observed, that, when the eye is altogether unpracticed in estimating elevation, it believes every point to be lower than it really is; but this does not militate against the proposition, for it is also well known, that the higher the point, the greater the deception., NR: 960, Book ID: The Poetry of Architecture by John Ruskin, Processed Text: hope languag may long retain corrupt energet superl posit well two preced import need confirm ha often eye altogeth unpract elev belief everi point lower realli doe milit proposit also well known higher point greater decept

TEXT:  "I should think," was the reply, "I could climb it in two steps; but I am too well used to hills to be taken in in that way; it is at least 40 feet." The real height was 470 feet. This deception is attributable to several causes (independently of the clearness of the medium through which the object is seen), which it would be out of place to discuss here, but the chief of which is the natural tendency of the feelings always to believe objects subtending the same angle to be of the same height., NR: 964, Book ID: The Poetry of Architecture by John Ruskin, Processed Text: think wa repli could climb two step well use hill taken way least foot real height wa foot decept attribut sever caus independ clear medium object seen would place discu chief natur tendenc feel alway believ object angl height
TEXT:  We say the feelings, not the eye; for the practiced eye never betrays its possessor, though the due and corresponding mental impression is not received. [49] This is rather a bold assertion; and we should be sorry to maintain the fact as universal; but the crystals of almost all the rarer minerals are larger in the larger mountain; and that altogether independently of the period of elevation, which, in the case of Mont Blanc, is later than that of our own Mendips., NR: 965, Book ID: The Poetry of Architecture by John Ruskin, Processed Text: say feel eye practic eye never possessor though due correspond mental impress receiv rather bold assert sorri maintain fact univers crystal almost miner mountain altogeth independ period elev case blanc later

TEXT:  We delight, indeed, in observing the rise of such a building as La Madeleine: beautiful, because accurately copied; useful, as teaching the eye of every passer-by.

TEXT:  The mistake of our architects in general is, that they fancy they are speaking good English by speaking bad Greek. We wish, therefore, that copying were more in vogue than it is. But imitation, the endeavor to be Gothic, or Tyrolese, or Venetian, without the slightest grain of Gothic or Venetian feeling; the futile effort to splash a building into age, or daub it into dignity, to zigzag it into sanctity, or slit it into ferocity, when its shell is neither ancient nor dignified, and its spirit neither priestly nor baronial,—this is the degrading vice of the age; fostered, as if man's reason were but a step between the brains of a kitten and a monkey, in the mixed love of despicable excitement and miserable mimicry., NR: 973, Book ID: The Poetry of Architecture by John Ruskin, Processed Text: mistak architect gener fanci speak good speak bad wish therefor vogu imit endeavor without grain feel futil effort splash build age daub digniti zigzag sanctiti slit feroc shell neither ancient dignifi spirit neither priestli baroni degrad vice age man reason step brain kitten monkey mix love despic excit miser mimicri

The scarlet coat or the turned-down collar, which the obsequious portrait-painter puts on the shoulders and off the necks of his savage or insane customers, never can make the 'prentice look military, or the idiot poetical; and the architectural appurtenances of Norman embrasure or Veronaic balcony must be equally ineffective, until they can turn shopkeepers into barons, and schoolgirls into Juliets., NR: 975, Book ID: The Poetry of Architecture by John Ruskin, Processed Text: nation architectur never improv popul gener convinc art cannot seem cannot scarlet coat turn collar obsequi portrait painter put shoulder neck savag insan custom never make prentic look militari idiot poetic architectur appurten embrasur balconi must equal ineffect turn shopkeep baron schoolgirl
