TEXT:  We wish to talk about curating: because it has been seeking novel ways of instantiating the crises of our world in other modalities, of finding other ways to engage with our current woes.

TEXT:  Our friends and colleagues from many different arenas have also come along and held seminars and discussed their complex practices and intricate thought processes. At the very beginning, six years ago, someone said half-jokingly, ‘our project is to stop people curating!’ and some weeks later someone else said, a bit more vehemently: ‘so are we agreed that this programme is not about becoming better curators?’ With hindsight, these were actually statements of considerable substance, which recognized that the proliferation of curatorial activities, courses, residencies and prizes has led to massive activity, driven by energy and an enthusiasm for displays and events, much of which is less than fully considered., NR: 10, Book ID: A Philosophy of Curating, Processed Text: friend colleagu mani differ arena also come along seminar complex practic intric thought process begin six year ago someon said half jokingli project stop peopl week later someon els said bit vehement agre becom better curat hindsight actual statement consider substanc prolifer curatori activ cours resid prize ha led massiv activ driven energi enthusiasm display event much less fulli consid

TEXT:  It has always been our desire to enter the discussion as ‘provocateurs’ rather than as ‘experts’ – we have understood that historical and other expertise is easily converted into the legitimation of market-driven spectacles and therefore cannot provide the self-reflexive speculation we continue to think the field requires if it is to become more than a series of professional protocols., NR: 12, Book ID: A Philosophy of Curating, Processed Text: ha alway desir enter discuss rather expert understood histor easili convert legitim market driven spectacl therefor cannot provid self reflex specul continu think field becom seri profession protocol
TEXT:  Alongside these market-driven spectacles a whole gamut of curatorial activities take place, calling into question what it is that is really taking place underneath all this glitter. These activities have taken many shapes: for example, we have seen the entry of the pedagogical into the field under the aegis of ‘the educational turn’, the (re)animation of abandoned sites and the (re-)infiltration of existing institutions, and we have also witnessed a strong insistence on talking, conversing, discussing and reading, activities that are in themselves often understood as the very stuff of what it is to make things visible, legible and relevant., NR: 13, Book ID: A Philosophy of Curating, Processed Text: alongsid market driven spectacl whole gamut curatori activ take place call question realli take place underneath glitter activ taken mani shape exampl seen entri pedagog field aegi educ turn anim abandon site infiltr institut also strong insist talk read activ often understood stuff make thing visibl legibl relev

TEXT:  Initially we recognized a necessity to distinguish between ‘curating’ and ‘the curatorial’. If ‘curating’ is a gamut of professional practices that had to do with setting up exhibitions and other modes of display, then ‘the curatorial’ operates at a very different level: it explores all that takes place on the stage set-up, both intentionally and unintentionally, by the curator and views it as an event of knowledge., NR: 15, Book ID: A Philosophy of Curating, Processed Text: initi necess distinguish curatori gamut profession practic set exhibit mode display curatori differ level take place stage set intent unintent curat view event knowledg
TEXT:  So to drive home a distinction between ‘curating’ and ‘the curatorial’ means to emphasize a shift from the staging of the event to the actual event itself: its enactment, dramatization and performance., NR: 16, Book ID: A Philosophy of Curating, Processed Text: drive home distinct curatori mean emphas shift stage event actual event enact dramat perform
TEXT:  ‘Curating’ takes place in a promise; it produces a moment of promise, of redemption to come. By contrast, ‘the curatorial’ is what disturbs this process; it breaks up this stage, yet produces a narrative which comes into being in the very moment in which an utterance takes place, in that moment in which the event communicates and says, as Mieke Bal once observed, ‘look, that is how this is’., NR: 17, Book ID: A Philosophy of Curating, Processed Text: take place promis produc moment promis redempt come contrast curatori process break stage yet produc narr come moment utter take place moment event say bal look
TEXT:  So ‘the curatorial’ is a disturbance, an utterance, a narrative. And within this disturbance, works of art can no longer be a process of interpellation, a conscious or unconscious hailing by some internalized mode of knowledge., NR: 18, Book ID: A Philosophy of Curating, Processed Text: curatori disturb utter narr within disturb work art longer process interpel consciou unconsci mode knowledg
TEXT:  Instead, they engage in another process, that of precipitating our reflection, of encouraging another way of thinking or sensing the world. From being reactive to the world to precipitating another reflection on the world (and inevitably sparking ways to change the world), works of art reflect the myriad ways of being implicated in the world, not just as passive recipients, but as active members of a world that is never one with itself, always out of joint, out of place, but always intrinsically ours – of our own making., NR: 19, Book ID: A Philosophy of Curating, Processed Text: instead engag anoth process reflect encourag anoth way think world reactiv world anoth reflect world inevit spark way chang world work art reflect myriad way world passiv recipi activ member world never one alway joint place alway intrins make
TEXT:  Not wishing to operate within a space of binary oppositions (art vs art history or practice vs theory, for example), we have brought in ‘the philosophical’, not as a master discipline or narrative to explain all, but as a slightly distantiated mode of reflection., NR: 20, Book ID: A Philosophy of Curating, Processed Text: wish oper within space binari opposit art art histori practic theori exampl brought philosoph master disciplin narr explain slightli mode reflect
TEXT:  This has enabled the introduction of a critical edge that maintains a somewhat sovereign position, detached from the seeming imperatives of everyday demands.

TEXT:  It is simply the recognition that by bringing some strands of contemporary philosophical and theoretical thought to the discussion of ‘the curatorial’, we open the possibility of reflecting in a way that goes beyond the simple description of projects and experiences., NR: 22, Book ID: A Philosophy of Curating, Processed Text: simpli recognit strand contemporari philosoph theoret thought discuss curatori open possibl reflect way go beyond simpl descript project experi
TEXT:  Given the immense expansion of the field and of how central it has become to the visual arts and other modes of cultural practice, it seems to us that it is now imperative to develop a discourse that reaches outwards, beyond the professional milieu, and that allows itself to be challenged by some of the most complex and ethics-driven thought of our times., NR: 23, Book ID: A Philosophy of Curating, Processed Text: given immens expans field central ha becom visual art mode cultur practic imper develop discours reach outward beyond profession milieu complex ethic driven thought time

TEXT:  From the moment we established the Curatorial/Knowledge programme, we fell into an ongoing conversation that meandered in many directions and has moved us all, quite unawares, along with it.

TEXT: Introduction Jean-Paul Martinon On the eve of 26 July 1866, in his flat at 89 Rue de Rome in Paris, the symbolist poet, English teacher, theatre and fashion critic Stéphane Mallarmé starts to jot down on paper plans for a series of 2-hour multi-sensory events that, he hopes, will constitute the final Orphic explanation of life on earth., NR: 100, Book ID: A Philosophy of Curating, Processed Text: introduct jean eve flat rue symbolist poet teacher fashion critic stephan start jot paper plan seri hour sensori event hope constitut final explan life earth

TEXT:  An ‘Operator’ (half-priest half-comedian) will orchestrate the shows from behind the scenes with the help of 24 ‘Assistants’. Contrary to what one might think when the name of Mallarmé is mentioned (refined, carefully written abstract poetry), these events are very much conceived as an unscripted popular melodrama ‘without heroes’ to be performed by the general public itself (‘the Crowd’), a mass communal liturgy bringing all the arts together., NR: 103, Book ID: A Philosophy of Curating, Processed Text: oper half priest half comedian orchestr show behind scene help assist contrari one might think name refin care written abstract poetri event much popular melodrama without hero gener public crowd mass commun liturgi art togeth
TEXT:  Overall, Mallarmé’s aim is to expose ‘thought thinking itself’ and to synchronize poetry and art with the movement of the universe, and in the process allow the Absolute to expose and perform itself everywhere, once and for all., NR: 104, Book ID: A Philosophy of Curating, Processed Text: overal aim expos thought think synchron poetri art movement univers process allow absolut expos perform everywher

TEXT:  Slightly disgruntled at the complexity of the undertaking, Mallarmé finally agrees to give his project a title: he will call his final Orphic event This Is [C’est].

TEXT:  The quasi-eschatological masterpiece never sees the light of day. With some distance, Mallarmé’s phantasmagorical plans can now, obviously, be seen as a typical example of an artist attempting, yet again, to come up with a ‘Total Work of Art’ in the same vein as Wagner’s Gesamstkunstwerk or Scriabine’s Mysterium., NR: 107, Book ID: A Philosophy of Curating, Processed Text: quasi eschatolog masterpiec never see light day distanc plan obvious seen typic exampl artist yet come total work art vein
TEXT:  However, it can also be understood in a different way: as the ultimate curatorial event. Indeed, how is one not to see, in this aborted project, an attempt to think ‘the curatorial’ a century or so before the very word began to acquire meaning? The whole gamut of issues facing curators today is all laid out in the few cryptic notes Mallarmé’s family saved from the fire he mandated, which can perhaps be summarized in the following way (in no particular order): •This Is displays the work of others (mimes, dancers, pyrotechnists, priests, etc., NR: 108, Book ID: A Philosophy of Curating, Processed Text: howev also understood differ way ultim curatori event inde one see abort project attempt think curatori centuri word acquir mean whole gamut issu face curat today laid cryptic note famili save fire perhap follow way particular order display work mime dancer priest

TEXT:  •This Is has no single point of view or perspective: the participants make the perspective. It is formative, educational, and potentially political. This Is might perhaps resemble a failed attempt at a ‘Total Work of Art’, it might also be delusory and grandiose beyond reckoning, but it is also a contemporary curatorial project before its time: the author is dead, disciplines are blurred, it is performative, open-ended, synaesthetic, potentially politically transformative and above all, as Mallarmé’s notes with their endless numerical figures testify, regulated by financial concerns for its realization., NR: 116, Book ID: A Philosophy of Curating, Processed Text: ha singl point view perspect particip make perspect form educ potenti polit might perhap resembl attempt total work art might also delusori grandios beyond reckon also contemporari curatori project time author dead disciplin blur perform open end potenti polit transform note endless numer figur testifi regul financi concern realiz
TEXT:  Invoking this odd, imagined project at the start of a collection of texts on contemporary curatorial practices is not intended to identify This Is as the clichéd point of origin or ultimate referent for the curatorial, but to highlight some of the issues that are at stake when addressing this multifaceted and controversial practice., NR: 117, Book ID: A Philosophy of Curating, Processed Text: odd project start collect text contemporari curatori practic intend identifi point origin ultim refer curatori highlight issu stake multifacet controversi practic
TEXT:  I say ‘some’ because, as is well known, the curatorial can never be constricted.

TEXT:  Some complain that this is a problem. I would argue that, on the contrary, the protean guises of ‘the curatorial’ are precisely what give it its power and potential.

TEXT:  Allow me to roughly summarize how this comes across (a summary that curiously echoes some of the remarks made about Mallarmé’s fantasy project). The curatorial is a jailbreak from pre-existing frames, a gift enabling one to see the world differently, a strategy for inventing new points of departure, a practice of creating allegiances against social ills, a way of caring for humanity, a process of renewing one’s own subjectivity, a tactical move for reinventing life, a sensual practice of creating signification, a political tool outside of politics, a procedure to maintain a community together, a conspiracy against policies, the act of keeping a question alive, the energy of retaining a sense of fun, the device that helps to revisit history, the measures to create affects, the work of revealing ghosts, a plan to remain out-of-joint with time, an evolving method of keeping bodies and objects together, a sharing of understanding, an invitation for reflexivity, a choreographic mode of operation, a way of fighting against corporate culture, etc., NR: 126, Book ID: A Philosophy of Curating, Processed Text: allow roughli summar come across summari curious echo remark made fantasi project curatori frame gift one see world differ strategi new point departur practic allegi social ill way human process one subject tactic move life sensual practic signif polit tool outsid polit procedur maintain commun togeth conspiraci polici act keep question aliv energi retain sens fun devic help revisit histori measur creat affect work reveal ghost plan remain joint time method keep bodi object togeth understand invit reflex choreograph mode oper way fight corpor cultur

TEXT:  •Stefan Nowotny takes us back to the mythological origin of the word ‘curatorial’ with Gaius Julius Hyginus’s fable of Cura. His aim is not to emphasize once again that the origin of this concept relates to the activity of caring (for objects, for example), but to a moment of suspension or questioning in the middle of a whirlpool of uncertainties and dangerous currents., NR: 146, Book ID: A Philosophy of Curating, Processed Text: take back mytholog origin word curatori fabl aim emphas origin concept activ object exampl moment suspens middl whirlpool uncertainti danger current
TEXT:  With this focus, Nowotny uncovers a new potential for curators, one which suddenly directs us right at the heart of what it means to be human. •Drawing a distinction between the professional decision to become a curator and the ongoing act of becoming-curator, Suzana Milevska invigorates the way current curatorial strategies operate today., NR: 147, Book ID: A Philosophy of Curating, Processed Text: focu new potenti curat one suddenli right heart mean human draw distinct profession decis becom curat ongo act becom curat way current curatori strategi oper today

TEXT:  Vergara’s essay draws a parallel between choreography and curating and in the process proposes to practise an ‘exhausted curating’.

TEXT:  Through these, Doussan strikes a serious blow to the autism that Agamben confined us to. * * * Part III is called Moves. This could give the impression that, once again, the focus will be on the fact that everything is transient, there are no subjects, no objects, no fixed knowledge, no finite bodies, no clear marks or demarcations and that we all live endless performances over constantly shifting grounds., NR: 153, Book ID: A Philosophy of Curating, Processed Text: strike seriou blow autism confin part move could give impress focu fact everyth transient subject object fix knowledg finit bodi clear mark demarc live endless perform constantli shift ground
TEXT:  Nothing is further away from this cliché than this section. Moves implies not simply fluctuation or unsteadiness, but a deliberate change of position or a calculated shift of settings. The overall aim of the following ‘moves’ is political in the sense that they attempt to distort, subvert, abuse, misuse what is generally taken for granted and is therefore hegemonic., NR: 154, Book ID: A Philosophy of Curating, Processed Text: noth away clich section move simpli fluctuat unsteadi deliber chang posit calcul shift set overal aim follow move polit sens attempt distort subvert abus misus gener taken therefor hegemon
TEXT:  The five authors in this section use all the available tools (real or imaginary) to do this. The end result is a reconfiguration and redistribution of words, events, tactics, names and language that any serious reading of the curatorial would and from now on will find difficult to ignore, to brush off, to which it can no longer turn a blind eye or a deaf ear., NR: 155, Book ID: A Philosophy of Curating, Processed Text: five author section use avail tool real imaginari end result redistribut word event tactic name languag seriou read curatori would find difficult ignor brush longer turn blind eye deaf ear
TEXT:  •Ariella Azoulay begins the proceedings by providing us – in three languages – with the tools that have helped her curate the exhibition Constituent Violence 1947–50. At first, these tools appear as if they are only applicable to the context of Israel and Palestine: shifting the treacherous delineations and sedimentations that have structured a geopolitical situation in order to open up a different future., NR: 156, Book ID: A Philosophy of Curating, Processed Text: begin proceed provid three languag tool curat exhibit constitu violenc first tool appear applic context shift treacher delin sediment structur geopolit situat order open differ futur

TEXT:  In doing so, her aim is to focus on this intangible moment called ‘the beginning’: the point at which the curatorial sets off. Unlike curating, which structures itself by setting up or obeying real or imaginary limits (funding deadlines, openings, closings, etc., NR: 158, Book ID: A Philosophy of Curating, Processed Text: aim focu intang moment begin point curatori set unlik structur set real imaginari limit deadlin open
TEXT: ), the curatorial is, on the contrary, a simple operator that allows us to blur all these (dead)lines and limits thus challenging and (some times) attenuating their constraining powers. •Doreen Mende proposes three short vignettes that allow us to see how a small displacement of meaning can potentially open up a new field of investigation in curatorial studies., NR: 159, Book ID: A Philosophy of Curating, Processed Text: curatori contrari simpl oper blur dead line limit thu time constrain power three short vignett allow see small displac mean potenti open new field investig curatori studi
TEXT:  She asks three pointed questions: is there not a blind spot between curating and the curatorial? Is there not, alongside what is exhibited, what is also inhibited? And finally, are exposures and interpretations not symptoms of a missing origin to the work of art? The use of words such as blind spot, inhibiting and symptom might at first seem unreasonable, but on reflection they soon reveal their true potential., NR: 160, Book ID: A Philosophy of Curating, Processed Text: three point question blind spot curatori alongsid also final exposur interpret symptom miss origin work art use word blind spot symptom might first seem unreason reflect soon reveal true potenti
TEXT:  •Roopesh Sitharan confronts us by giving us a text written in both Malay and English. His aim is not perverse: an act of pedantic sophistry, for example. His aim is to deliberately expose how knowledge takes place: in shifts of language., NR: 161, Book ID: A Philosophy of Curating, Processed Text: give text written aim pervers act pedant sophistri exampl aim deliber expos knowledg take place shift languag
TEXT:  These can be idiomatic (Malay-English in his case), but these can also be curatorial (subject-object, for example). These shifts show that knowledge cannot take place without blind spots or ‘vacuums’ as Sitharan says., NR: 162, Book ID: A Philosophy of Curating, Processed Text: idiomat case also curatori subject object exampl shift show knowledg cannot take place without blind spot vacuum say
TEXT:  The curatorial needs them for otherwise nothing (on the page or the exhibiting space) would ever take place. •Finally, Joshua Simon, adopting the style of a public declaration at a political rally, brings this section back to Israel-Palestine., NR: 163, Book ID: A Philosophy of Curating, Processed Text: curatori need otherwis noth page space would ever take place final style public declar polit ralli section back
TEXT:  In doing so, he reveals for us the most paradigmatic and problematic shift imaginable: ‘betrayal’. With this word, his aim is not to propose a new tool.

TEXT:  * * * Part IV is entitled Heresies. At first, the word ‘heresies’ could be understood as a set of opinions profoundly at odds with what is generally accepted. If this were the case, then the following essays would simply be understood as performing a critique of received ideas about the curatorial and its place in the world., NR: 166, Book ID: A Philosophy of Curating, Processed Text: part heresi first word heresi could understood set opinion profoundli odd gener accept case follow essay would simpli understood critiqu receiv idea curatori place world
TEXT:  However, Heresies is understood here to have a different meaning. As the essays in this section demonstrate, the issue is not one of critique (pretending to stand outside of the institution) or criticality (shifting the parameters within the institution), but about inventing new terms that defy the odds., NR: 167, Book ID: A Philosophy of Curating, Processed Text: howev heresi understood differ mean essay section demonstr issu one critiqu stand outsid institut critic shift paramet within institut new term defi odd
TEXT:  The shift is here crucial because the aim is not to put forward new opinions (doxa), but of regenerating knowledge (episteme). In doing so, these contributors ask us to have a good look at our vocabulary for it might contain many clichés and hang-ups and it is high time that these are replaced., NR: 168, Book ID: A Philosophy of Curating, Processed Text: shift crucial aim put forward new opinion doxa knowledg contributor ask good look vocabulari might contain mani clich high time

TEXT:  Against this, they propose to become complicit in acts of conspiracy that, extraordinarily, know no plot. This has huge consequences for the curatorial because it provides a clear ethics that defy ‘good governance’ and ‘good policy’., NR: 170, Book ID: A Philosophy of Curating, Processed Text: propos becom act conspiraci extraordinarili know plot ha huge consequ curatori clear ethic defi good govern good polici
TEXT:  Anarchical, we should all work together on this conspiracy without a plot. We have nothing to lose. •Shunning the idea that a question is just a starting point or a framework for a discourse, Susan Kelly addresses the possibility of transforming questions into political incentives able to challenge the way knowledge and practice are appropriated by hegemonic systems of power., NR: 171, Book ID: A Philosophy of Curating, Processed Text: anarch work togeth conspiraci without plot noth lose idea question start point framework discours kelli address possibl transform question polit incent abl challeng way knowledg practic hegemon system power
TEXT:  Armed with a renewed understanding of what a question is, Kelly helps us to see that, contrary to what is commonly believed, an artwork, an exhibition, or an institution are not just questions waiting to be answered, but sites of empowerment where knowledge and practice can regain all their political potential., NR: 172, Book ID: A Philosophy of Curating, Processed Text: arm understand question kelli help see contrari commonli exhibit institut question wait site empower knowledg practic regain polit potenti

TEXT:  Inevitably, the problem is always, how does one make sure that this ‘something’ is actually worth happening? Sternfeld addresses this problem by emphasizing the importance of always retaining the uncertainty or the possibility of the question (a decided ‘perhaps’) as the central tenet of any curatorial event., NR: 174, Book ID: A Philosophy of Curating, Processed Text: inevit problem alway doe one make sure someth actual worth happen address problem import alway retain uncertainti possibl question decid perhap central tenet curatori event

TEXT:  While the former is constituted by a haughty attention to language, the latter is brought together through the affects of bodies. With this history, Graziano aims to bastardize curatorial practices in order to make them what they ought to be: neither elitist nor populist events., NR: 176, Book ID: A Philosophy of Curating, Processed Text: former haughti attent languag latter brought togeth affect bodi histori aim bastard curatori practic order make ought neither event
TEXT:  * * * The title of Part V (Refigurations) is borrowed from Donna Haraway and its use in the context of this book is an attempt not to fall victim to the temptation of always re-con-figuring the world, that is, of always pretending that we all agree (con – together) on the particular shapes and forms of our world., NR: 177, Book ID: A Philosophy of Curating, Processed Text: titl part donna use context book attempt fall victim temptat alway con world alway agre con togeth particular shape form world
TEXT:  Abandoning the need to articulate these false accords, this fifth section therefore focuses on personal refigurations of what is usually taken for granted. This takes a variety of unexpected shapes: rethinking the idea of the modern, reimagining exhibitions as devices, rewriting the history of a local community or region, and refiguring what ‘being-contemporary’ actually means., NR: 178, Book ID: A Philosophy of Curating, Processed Text: need articul fals accord fifth section therefor focu person usual taken take varieti unexpect shape idea modern exhibit devic histori local commun region contemporari actual mean
TEXT:  With these refigurations, the curatorial expands its remit and becomes not only a tool to challenge disciplines (history, geography, anthropology, ethnography, etc.) and their appending fields of knowledge, but also a tool with increasing political potential., NR: 179, Book ID: A Philosophy of Curating, Processed Text: curatori remit becom tool challeng disciplin histori geographi anthropolog ethnographi field knowledg also tool increas polit potenti
TEXT:  •What else calls the most for refiguration, but modern art? Contrary to received opinion, Helmut Draxler argues that modern art is not a specific period in history that would pitch itself neatly against contemporary art., NR: 180, Book ID: A Philosophy of Curating, Processed Text: els call modern art contrari receiv opinion modern art specif period histori would pitch neatli contemporari art
TEXT:  Modern art has never left our horizons of understanding because it is a multiplicity of affects and discourses that, so far, has resisted all attempts at generalization and reduction. Draxler’s argument becomes particularly poignant with regards to collection and curating because they are the real motors that continue to make the ‘modern’ in art such an uncanny presence today., NR: 181, Book ID: A Philosophy of Curating, Processed Text: modern art ha never left horizon understand multipl affect discours far ha attempt gener reduct argument becom particularli poignant regard collect real motor continu make modern art uncanni presenc today
TEXT:  •Jean-Louis Déotte challenges us by considering the exhibition at the same level as the radio: both are surfaces of (re)production. Basing his argument on the work of Walter Benjamin, Déotte argues that an exhibition and a radio are surfaces of (re)production because unlike art, they are aesthetic devices., NR: 182, Book ID: A Philosophy of Curating, Processed Text: jean challeng consid exhibit level radio surfac product argument work walter benjamin exhibit radio surfac product unlik art aesthet devic
TEXT:  This does not mean that the exhibition and the radio are identical to mechanical reproduction.

TEXT:  •Anshuman Dasgupta takes us to Sikkim. For him, the curatorial reveals itself as a ‘sensuous’ event that takes place when the dynamics of a site are exposed in a workshop. The aim of this workshop is to get the local community to come together and work out the dynamics of the sites they inhabit., NR: 184, Book ID: A Philosophy of Curating, Processed Text: take curatori sensuou event take place dynam site expos workshop aim workshop get local commun come togeth work dynam site inhabit
TEXT:  In this way, the curator is therefore neither an anthropologist nor an ethnographer, but simply one who brings people together for a sensuous gathering of community building. With his unusual curatorial project, Dasgupta slowly refigures the history of this little-known part of the world., NR: 185, Book ID: A Philosophy of Curating, Processed Text: way curat therefor neither anthropologist ethnograph simpli one peopl togeth sensuou gather commun build unusu curatori project slowli histori littl known part world
TEXT:  •In a thorough analysis, Cihat Arinç teaches us that the curatorial is an event that also takes place in cinema and specifically, in what concerns him here, in recent Turkish cinema. His aim is to reveal how particular directors curate ghostly objects (architectural, soundscape, narrative) in their film in order to reveal a different political side to official Turkish history., NR: 186, Book ID: A Philosophy of Curating, Processed Text: thorough analysi teach curatori event also take place cinema specif concern recent cinema aim reveal particular director curat ghostli object architectur narr film order reveal differ polit side offici histori

TEXT:  This does not imply proposing a different modernity (a different precursor to today’s world, for example), but aims to expose the many contradictions that make an individual ‘contemporary’ today, all in the hope of not ending up in a timeless no man’s land., NR: 189, Book ID: A Philosophy of Curating, Processed Text: doe impli differ modern differ precursor today world exampl aim expos mani contradict make individu contemporari today hope end timeless man land
TEXT:  * * * Part VI is titled Stages. With this word, the intention is not to compare the curatorial with theatre. In theatre, a stage is usually a raised floor or platform on which actors perform. When it comes to the curatorial, the stage expands beyond all recognition, taking in buildings, sites, geographical areas and even, in some cases, countries., NR: 190, Book ID: A Philosophy of Curating, Processed Text: part titl stage word intent compar curatori stage usual rais floor platform actor perform come curatori stage beyond recognit take build site geograph area even case countri
TEXT:  With the word Stages, the intention is also not to compare the curatorial with a specific length of time, a point, period or step in a process of development (the seven stages of man, for example). When it comes to the curatorial, the idea of ‘period’ always gets a bit fuzzy: times crisscrossing each other to the point where it is no longer possible to talk of a determined period when this or that happened, when a show started or ended., NR: 191, Book ID: A Philosophy of Curating, Processed Text: word stage intent also compar curatori specif length time point period step process develop seven stage man exampl come curatori idea period alway get bit fuzzi time point longer possibl talk determin period show end
TEXT:  Stages mark instead, as Hannah Arendt’s quote in exergue of the texts in this section tells us, the co-appearance of subjects, objects, architectures, communities and worlds and with it, the formation of a polis., NR: 192, Book ID: A Philosophy of Curating, Processed Text: stage mark instead quot exergu text section tell appear subject object architectur commun world format poli
TEXT:  The curatorial is this polis, always transient, incomplete and thus necessarily controversial. In this way, the world is not a stage; stages make the world. •In order to differentiate between the curatorial (this event that sees the encounter of people and/or objects) and the para-curatorial (these secondary events that accompany the exhibition; participatory projects, for example), Bridget Crone proposes to understand the former as a sensible stage, that is, as a site’s organization and legibility., NR: 193, Book ID: A Philosophy of Curating, Processed Text: curatori poli alway transient incomplet thu necessarili controversi way world stage stage make world order differenti curatori event see encount peopl object para curatori secondari event accompani exhibit participatori project exampl crone understand former sensibl stage site organ legibl
TEXT:  The curatorial or the sensible stage is therefore an event and a diagram that forms itself as people, spaces and objects come together. This interpretation not only sets the tone for this section; it also allows us to have a clear understanding of the dynamisms at work when we speak of the curatorial., NR: 194, Book ID: A Philosophy of Curating, Processed Text: curatori sensibl stage therefor event diagram form peopl space object come togeth interpret set tone section also clear understand dynam work speak curatori
TEXT:  •Aneta Szyłak expands the notion of stage by exploring the notion of context. As a self-confessed methodologist who curates contexts, Szyłak’s aim is to show that a context is not a frame, but an event that is not only deliberately created as the process of curating is under way, but also occurs spontaneously and without agency., NR: 195, Book ID: A Philosophy of Curating, Processed Text: notion stage explor notion context self methodologist curat context aim show context frame event deliber process way also spontan without agenc
TEXT:  With this way of looking, Szyłak does not propose a set of formulas on how to investigate a site or a stage, a building or a gallery, a situation or an environment, but to put forward a praxis that needs to be reinvented each time anew., NR: 196, Book ID: A Philosophy of Curating, Processed Text: way look doe propos set formula investig site stage build galleri situat environ put forward praxi need time anew
TEXT:  •Ines Moreira asks us to divert our attention from the stage, its conceptualization, its actors and its settings in order to pay attention to what goes on behind the scenes: the backstage. To take a reverse perspective or to focus on the opposite side of a show’s construction is to focus on the mess, confusion and disorder that usually takes place before (and some times also behind) the stage and to expose the participatory processes of reflexivity that characterize exhibitions., NR: 197, Book ID: A Philosophy of Curating, Processed Text: divert attent stage actor set order pay attent go behind scene backstag take revers perspect focu opposit side show construct focu mess confus disord usual take place time also behind stage expos participatori process reflex character exhibit
TEXT:  From such a perspective, suddenly, concepts, ideas, and even languages all appear in a different light and the curatorial is no longer what it seems. •Finally, Je Yun Moon proposes to understand the curatorial as a choreographic mode of operation., NR: 198, Book ID: A Philosophy of Curating, Processed Text: perspect suddenli concept idea even languag appear differ light curatori longer final moon understand curatori choreograph mode oper

TEXT:  Curating is not the product of a subject in an assembly line; it is the result of a play of epistemic games that constantly put into question the limits of the subject and its practice. With Moon, the curatorial becomes this act of writing for the other, a gift of words, images and gestures that can only in turn be put in question., NR: 200, Book ID: A Philosophy of Curating, Processed Text: product subject assembl line result play epistem game constantli put question limit subject practic moon curatori becom act write gift word imag gestur turn put question

TEXT:  Esche’s text is here to simply remind us of the task at hand, that of producing what he calls ‘a critical surplus’, that is, an excess or remainder that allows not only for reflection, but also for the imagination to take off; an excess or remainder that, for once, cannot be appropriated by either ideology or market forces, precisely because it belongs to no one., NR: 203, Book ID: A Philosophy of Curating, Processed Text: text simpli remind task hand call critic surplu excess remaind reflect also imagin take excess remaind cannot either ideolog market forc precis one
TEXT:  If the old symbolist poet read these essays today, he would probably remain his disgruntled self because they would not give him the keys or methodologies to accomplish his ‘Total Work of Art’, but he would perhaps reluctantly agree that life on earth knows in fact no final Orphic explanation, only fragmentary answers that, surprisingly, not only give the chance to think again, but also the courage to fight back against the complacency of easy formulations, the lure of spectacles, the sedimentation of ideas, the draw of the sound bite, and, above all, against endless empty promises., NR: 204, Book ID: A Philosophy of Curating, Processed Text: old symbolist poet read essay today would probabl remain self would give key methodolog accomplish total work art would perhap reluctantli agre life earth know fact final explan fragmentari answer surprisingli give chanc think also courag fight back complac easi formul lure spectacl sediment idea draw sound bite endless empti promis

TEXT:  Yorick: the unfortunate clown who was reduced to a skull in Hamlet’s hand and a strophe in his graveyard ruminations. To be conscious of a limit, or frontier, is to be reminded at the same time of a horizon., NR: 219, Book ID: A Philosophy of Curating, Processed Text: unfortun clown wa reduc skull hamlet hand stroph graveyard rumin consciou limit frontier time horizon

TEXT:  Curatorial stasis produces an imprisoning boundary of frames and references. But the extension of curatorial curiosity into ‘dead zones’ may yet awaken new forms of artistic life. ‘Alas poor Yorick,’ says Hamlet, holding a dead jester’s skull in a graveyard., NR: 221, Book ID: A Philosophy of Curating, Processed Text: curatori stasi produc boundari frame refer extens curatori curios dead zone may yet awaken new form artist life ala poor say hamlet hold dead jester skull graveyard
TEXT:  The skull marks a limit – the frontier between life and death. Once, Yorick the clown was a man ‘of infinite jest and excellent fancy’, and then, he shrinks to a bony, grinning knob in Hamlet’s hand. To consider the skull with Hamlet is to reflect on the inevitability of the transaction between jest, fancy and what remains after., NR: 222, Book ID: A Philosophy of Curating, Processed Text: skull mark limit frontier life death clown wa man infinit jest excel fanci shrink boni grin knob hamlet hand consid skull hamlet reflect inevit transact jest fanci remain
TEXT:  But the memory of laughter in the presence of death is a sign that every border contains the secret of how it may be breached.

TEXT:  A confrontation. Xeriscape: a dry garden, using little or no irrigation. We come face to face with the ‘curatorial’ whenever we witness within ourselves or around us the collision of artistic forms. There can be head-on collisions, unforeseen accidents, jolts born of contact, eerie after-images as well as the accumulation of readings against the grain of intention., NR: 224, Book ID: A Philosophy of Curating, Processed Text: confront dri garden littl irrig come face face curatori whenev wit within around collis artist form head collis unforeseen accid jolt born contact eeri imag well accumul read grain intent
TEXT:  Contact and confrontation, in art, as in life, are an occasion for the multiplication of misunderstandings, for epidemics of meaning.

TEXT:  Surge:a powerful upward or forward movement; may be sudden, as in a thrust, or sustained, as in a wave. Every spell has its secret. When someone says hocus-pocus, they may not be aware that they are actually offering up a garbled version of a powerful incantation, ‘Hoc Est Corpus Meum’ – ‘Here is My Body’., NR: 240, Book ID: A Philosophy of Curating, Processed Text: surg power upward forward movement may sudden thrust sustain wave everi spell ha secret someon say hocu may awar actual offer version power incant corpu bodi

TEXT:  IR Insert ~ Residue Insert:to add, place, fit, or, a thing that has been added, placed, fitted. Residue:that which is left behind. To insert can be to sneak something in, to interpolate, to occupy, to incrementally add to an existing sum without being noticed., NR: 242, Book ID: A Philosophy of Curating, Processed Text: insert residu insert add place fit thing ha ad fit residu left behind insert sneak someth interpol occupi add sum without
TEXT:  The residual is that which gets left behind, which doesn’t get counted, which remains in the shadows. Both the insert and the residue occupy a space in the margins of the calculation, hidden deep within the folds or under the radar of the figure, and yet they change the count., NR: 243, Book ID: A Philosophy of Curating, Processed Text: residu get left behind get remain shadow insert residu occupi space margin calcul hidden deep within fold radar figur yet chang count
TEXT:  Sometimes, to add beyond necessity is to create a surplus. Every subtraction yields a residue. The relationship between an insert and a residue also straddles this delicate paradox.

TEXT:  Curatorial action can be a form of jailbreaking. One can coax a work out of its accustomed frame, provoke a situation into yielding results other than what its authors, actors and agents intended, create conditions for it to be released from what might be seen as its essence, its what-ness., NR: 246, Book ID: A Philosophy of Curating, Processed Text: curatori action form one coax work accustom frame provok situat yield result author actor agent intend creat condit might seen essenc ness
TEXT:  Sometimes, the jailbreaking we are attempting to describe here is simply a change of qualia, from quiddity (what-ness) to haecceity (this-ness).

TEXT:  Proposition:a word that can vary in its meaning, depending on the context in which it is used, ranging from an assertion to a proposal to an attempt at seduction.

TEXT:  Like Kumbhakarna’s prowess, which some attribute to his preference for sleep over wakefulness, the curatorial may derive its strength from gestation.

TEXT: 2 Theses in the Philosophy of Curating1 Jean-Paul Martinon Certainly one may say, ‘Freedom to speak or write can be taken from us by a superior power, but never the freedom to think!’ But how much, and how correctly, would we think if we did not think, as it were, in common with others, with whom we mutually communicate?

TEXT:  It is, first and foremost, a gift to oneself and then a gift between ourselves. This gift is not a little parcel that one passes to another. We all know that gifts-as-parcels are necessarily part of a contractual agreement: I’m giving you this (a present, a body of work or thought) in exchange for this or that (friendship, love, or entrance ticket, reviews and honours)., NR: 261, Book ID: A Philosophy of Curating, Processed Text: first foremost gift oneself gift gift littl parcel one pass anoth know gift parcel necessarili part contractu agreement give present bodi work thought exchang friendship love entranc ticket review
TEXT:  However, in order to have this contractual agreement or this gift-as-parcel, you first need a more primary kind of gift, you need a preliminary decision, a generosity beyond all forms of generosity. The curatorial is this first gift, a gift before the subject/object or curator/viewer relation, prior to any contractual determination, and therefore before politeness., NR: 262, Book ID: A Philosophy of Curating, Processed Text: howev order contractu agreement gift parcel first need primari kind gift need preliminari decis generos beyond form generos curatori first gift gift subject object curat viewer relat prior contractu determin therefor polit
TEXT:  In this way, and before any proper curating has taken place, the curatorial first establishes itself as gift structured by a radical law3 without which no gift-as-parcel would be possible. Inevitably, the problem, as Georges Bataille teaches us, is that this originary gift cannot effectively be assigned any mode of presence., NR: 263, Book ID: A Philosophy of Curating, Processed Text: way proper ha taken place curatori first gift structur radic law without gift parcel would possibl inevit problem teach originari gift cannot effect assign mode presenc
TEXT: 4 To think this first gift, this generosity, and therefore the curatorial, is to stop short at the necessity that makes a show happen (e.g. ‘do we really need this show?’). In this way, to think the curatorial, this gift, is to stop short at a necessity prior to any form of sociocultural or political urgency, a necessity that is impossible to contain, constrain or sublate., NR: 264, Book ID: A Philosophy of Curating, Processed Text: think first gift generos therefor curatori stop short necess make show happen realli need show way think curatori gift stop short necess prior form sociocultur polit urgenc necess imposs contain constrain sublat
TEXT:  The curatorial as gift is thus concerned, deep down, with a logic of fantasma5 (of what needs to be ex-posed or ex-hibited), that is, with a fantomatic irreducibility from which there is no escape.

TEXT:  The other of narrative The Dutch art historian Mieke Bal says that the activity of curating stands for the act of pointing: ‘“Look!” “That’s how it is!”’7 As such, the activity of curating is reminiscent of these little narratives we, humans, formulate to make sense of ourselves., NR: 271, Book ID: A Philosophy of Curating, Processed Text: narr dutch art historian bal say activ stand act point look activ reminisc littl narr human formul make sens

TEXT:  Spacing The curatorial is the spacing of concern for the other. This does not mean that exhibitions always expose a specific concern for the other or for this or that political or social problem. Because curating always says ‘Look!’ and ‘That’s how it is!’, it can only fail to expose a concern for the other even if it has altruistic and moral motives., NR: 276, Book ID: A Philosophy of Curating, Processed Text: space curatori space concern doe mean exhibit alway expos specif concern polit social problem alway say look fail expos concern even ha altruist moral motif
TEXT:  It fails because curating exposes first a concern for the exhibition, the artist, the curator and above all for the objects on display and then for the other or the audience, for example.

TEXT:  Curating is indeed above all self-preservation and this without even having mentioned the word ‘conservation’. No, the spacing of concern at stake here is that of the curatorial. Unlike curating, the curatorial spaces its concern for the other as the bodies of the artist(s), viewer(s), curator(s) move in the exhibition space., NR: 278, Book ID: A Philosophy of Curating, Processed Text: inde self preserv without even word conserv space concern stake curatori unlik curatori space concern bodi artist viewer curat move exhibit space

Send-Off The curatorial is a send-off that can never belong to the institution., NR: 286, Book ID: A Philosophy of Curating, Processed Text: word free show measur figur hidden send curatori send never belong institut
TEXT:  It is a send-off, not in the sense of a farewell in the hope or dread of a return, but in the sense of a challenge to the limits of both the institution and that of curating. In other words, the curatorial is a send-off because it pushes curating out of its comfort zones., NR: 287, Book ID: A Philosophy of Curating, Processed Text: send sens farewel hope dread return sens challeng limit institut word curatori send push comfort zone
TEXT:  As such, the aim of the curatorial, the aim of this send-off, is paradoxically to avoid at all cost proposals and projects, plans and designs, targets and objectives, strategies and tactics, programmes and platforms, that is anything that aims to circumscribe the future, to render it ever more future-present., NR: 288, Book ID: A Philosophy of Curating, Processed Text: aim curatori aim send paradox avoid cost propos project plan design target object strategi tactic platform anyth aim circumscrib futur render ever futur present
TEXT:  The curatorial is allergic to any attempt to circumcise what frames, organizes or freezes understanding. With this aim in mind – if such a thing can be said – the curatorial therefore articulates itself by always rendering the future always more futural, to futurize it so that it becomes not delusional or utopian, but radical, of a radicality that knows no projection or protection., NR: 289, Book ID: A Philosophy of Curating, Processed Text: curatori allerg attempt circumcis frame freez understand aim mind thing said curatori therefor alway render futur alway futur futur becom delusion utopian radic radic know project protect
TEXT:  This is not intended to disrupt curators’ (carefully) planned projects, (career) plans, schemes of destination or destinies, but to distract them, that is, to keep the door open and to maintain, as Jacques Derrida says, the possibility of the other to remain precisely that, other, unknown, that is, at once alluring and dangerous., NR: 290, Book ID: A Philosophy of Curating, Processed Text: intend disrupt curat care project career plan scheme destin destini distract keep door open maintain say possibl remain precis unknown allur danger
TEXT: 13 The curatorial is a send-off, a breaking of rhythm, a disruption of order, that is what causes worry in the exhibition. If curating is a(n) (institutional) practice, the curatorial is its send-off. Warrior of the imaginary The curatorial begins when there is an appreciable surplus that calls for disruption., NR: 291, Book ID: A Philosophy of Curating, Processed Text: curatori send break rhythm disrupt order caus worri exhibit institut practic curatori send warrior imaginari curatori begin appreci surplu call disrupt
TEXT:  This does not mean that it begins when comfort is reached. This simply means that the curatorial begins as soon as a line is drawn, a fullness is recognized or a horizon of understanding is acknowledged., NR: 292, Book ID: A Philosophy of Curating, Processed Text: doe mean begin comfort simpli mean curatori begin soon line drawn full horizon understand acknowledg
TEXT:  Once this is reached, the curatorial ventures itself to disrupt it, but not by displacing the line, bursting what appears replete or shifting horizons. The curatorial disrupts in a different way. It disrupts by thickening the lines, weighing down the overloaded, intensifying the horizons., NR: 293, Book ID: A Philosophy of Curating, Processed Text: curatori ventur disrupt line replet shift horizon curatori differ way thicken line weigh horizon
TEXT:  Overall, this densification has only one aim: to avoid the avant-garde project of marching aggressively against an enemy line, detonating opulence or dealing head first with confining limits. It intends instead, following Patrick Chamoiseau’s work, to densify in order to multiply the potential for the imaginary., NR: 294, Book ID: A Philosophy of Curating, Processed Text: overal densif ha one aim avoid project aggress enemi line opul deal head first confin limit instead follow work densifi order multipli potenti imaginari
TEXT: 14 Why the imaginary? Because the imaginary is the only thing that can never be drawn with any certainty, can never be satiated or simply confined by a discipline or practice. As such, the imaginary remains a pure political tool untainted by the stench of politics., NR: 295, Book ID: A Philosophy of Curating, Processed Text: imaginari imaginari thing never drawn certainti never simpli confin disciplin practic imaginari remain pure polit tool untaint stench polit
TEXT:  This is no idealism. This is on the contrary, the most concrete battle conceivable because it knows neither rhetoric nor spin and therefore neither deceit nor dishonesty. So if the curatorial can be seen to encourage something, it will be to encourage artists, curators, and viewers to retain the vertigo that heightens the un-known: to be a warrior of the imaginary, abandoned to extremes and working without magnetic north or compass., NR: 296, Book ID: A Philosophy of Curating, Processed Text: ideal contrari concret battl conceiv know neither rhetor spin therefor neither deceit curatori seen encourag someth encourag artist curat viewer retain vertigo known warrior imaginari abandon extrem work without magnet north compass
TEXT:  A place that isn’t one The curatorial always takes place in the middle, between promise (a coming reflection, contemplation, or action) and redemption (intellectual achievement, aesthetic emotion or political resolution)., NR: 297, Book ID: A Philosophy of Curating, Processed Text: place one curatori alway take place middl promis come reflect contempl action redempt intellectu achiev aesthet emot polit resolut

TEXT:  It takes place on an indefinite, but finite horizon. How is one to understand this curious place? Let me take each word one at a time. It is indefinite because like consciousness, it can never be fixed or limited:15 it always goes off, giving, disrupting, challenging preconceived orders, unsettling the firmly established., NR: 299, Book ID: A Philosophy of Curating, Processed Text: take place indefinit finit horizon one understand curiou place let take word one time indefinit like conscious never fix limit alway go give preconceiv order unsettl firmli establish
TEXT:  It is finite because it is necessarily structured by death: the curatorial, like consciousness, is always already a dying body, a finite thought. As such, the curatorial is indistinguishable from the work of mourning as Jacques Derrida understands this expression., NR: 300, Book ID: A Philosophy of Curating, Processed Text: finit necessarili structur death curatori like conscious alway alreadi die bodi finit thought curatori work mourn express
TEXT: 16 Finally, it is a horizon17 because it necessarily involves invaginated topologies (bodies and minds), that is, topologies that can never be limited or circumscribed (where indeed does the body or mind stop?)., NR: 301, Book ID: A Philosophy of Curating, Processed Text: final horizon necessarili topolog bodi mind topolog never limit circumscrib inde doe bodi mind stop
TEXT:  The place of the curatorial, this middle that can never be identified as such, is therefore what offers itself without end, but paradoxically remains finite, thus clearly confirming that it is indeed an event., NR: 302, Book ID: A Philosophy of Curating, Processed Text: place curatori middl never therefor offer without end paradox remain finit thu clearli confirm inde event
TEXT:  The ignorant body As we have seen, the curatorial disrupts knowledge in order to invent knowledge. As such, its aim is to give the possibility for more lines of demarcation to be drawn, for the fullness of meaning to be achieved and for horizons of understanding to be set., NR: 303, Book ID: A Philosophy of Curating, Processed Text: ignor bodi seen curatori knowledg order invent knowledg aim give possibl line demarc drawn full mean horizon understand set
TEXT:  In doing so, the curatorial doesn’t concern itself with bodies of knowledge (artworks, for example) placed as if a pile of dung – real or metaphorical – on a space, field, street, or stage set up by the curator and ready to be scrutinized or analysed by the viewer., NR: 304, Book ID: A Philosophy of Curating, Processed Text: curatori concern bodi knowledg exampl pile dung real metaphor space field street stage set curat readi viewer
TEXT:  As we have seen, the curatorial is concerned with the densification of these lines, masses and horizons that define these bodies, these piles of dung. The hermeneutic aim – if there is one – behind this odd concern is not to totalize or singularize these piles (of knowledge) and therefore confirm them, ready for viewing and teaching, as either true or false., NR: 305, Book ID: A Philosophy of Curating, Processed Text: seen curatori concern densif line mass horizon defin bodi pile dung hermeneut aim one behind odd concern total singular pile knowledg therefor confirm readi teach either true fals
TEXT:  The aim is simply, and however disappointing this will seem, to sustain their continued formation. As such, and perhaps unbeknownst to itself, the curatorial cherishes ignorance, not as an aspiration towards stupidity, but in a Bataillean sense, as a letting go of what calls (sometimes desperately) for possession., NR: 306, Book ID: A Philosophy of Curating, Processed Text: aim simpli howev disappoint seem sustain continu format perhap unbeknownst curatori ignor aspir toward stupid sens call sometim desper possess
TEXT: 18 In other words, the curatorial cherishes what (sometimes stubbornly) resists knowledge. On its way, the curatorial can therefore only leave the pile of dung or knowledge behind and (re)invent itself again as body, that is, as ignorant body., NR: 307, Book ID: A Philosophy of Curating, Processed Text: word curatori sometim stubbornli knowledg way curatori therefor leav pile dung knowledg behind invent bodi ignor bodi
TEXT:  In its perambulation, the curatorial thus moves not from one exhibition space to another or from one dung-pile to another as if on an erratic apian journey, but simply in an effort to let go of knowledge, that is, in an effort to sustain the disruption of knowledge., NR: 308, Book ID: A Philosophy of Curating, Processed Text: perambul curatori thu move one exhibit space anoth one dung pile anoth errat apian journey simpli effort let knowledg effort sustain disrupt knowledg
TEXT:  Thought We often complain that it is impossible to limit the field of the curatorial because it always actively engages more than one discipline or practice (art and architecture or art and anthropology, for example)., NR: 309, Book ID: A Philosophy of Curating, Processed Text: thought often complain imposs limit field curatori alway activ one disciplin practic art architectur art anthropolog exampl
TEXT:  But the real question behind this complaint is this: is it at all possible to limit thinking?

TEXT:  On the contrary, thought (and therefore the curatorial) forms itself, as Martin Heidegger would say, as the shifting possibilities of a structural variation present themselves.19 In other words, thought is that which forms the contingent while (being) in the throes of contingency., NR: 311, Book ID: A Philosophy of Curating, Processed Text: contrari thought therefor curatori form martin would say shift possibl structur variat present word thought form conting throe conting
TEXT:  In this way, one does not curate or view an exhibition by stumbling across limits (a work of art, for example). These limits (and these works) form themselves unexpectedly as we create them. Is it not the case that curating today, as an activity, increasingly moves towards participation, the sharing of responsibility for what is being exhibited? The curatorial is therefore this activity of always engaging disciplines or practices and of transcending them beyond their supposedly invariable appearances., NR: 312, Book ID: A Philosophy of Curating, Processed Text: way one doe curat view exhibit stumbl across limit work art exampl limit work form unexpectedli creat case today activ increasingli move toward particip respons curatori therefor activ alway engag disciplin practic transcend beyond supposedli invari appear
TEXT:  The question, which no doubt will be on everyone’s mind while reading the above nine theses, is how is one then to distinguish between the curatorial and thought? To do so would be, as we have seen, to stop both thought and the curatorial, that is, to shift the possibilities of structural variations in such a way that they no longer recognize themselves., NR: 313, Book ID: A Philosophy of Curating, Processed Text: question doubt everyon mind read nine thesi one distinguish curatori thought would seen stop thought curatori shift possibl structur variat way longer recogn
TEXT:  But is this possible? Would that not simply imply stepping outside of thought (and therefore the curatorial)? If this were possible, thought would no longer be able to re-present (and therefore curate) itself and the curatorial would no longer be able to think itself., NR: 314, Book ID: A Philosophy of Curating, Processed Text: possibl would simpli impli step outsid thought therefor curatori possibl thought would longer abl present therefor curat curatori would longer abl think

TEXT:  Today, I see things differently. It seems to me that the whole matter of reading newspapers from the past is actually a wise move: an act of foreseeing the future rather than a retrospective one. But how is this possible? What is it about old news that allows a glimpse of the future? And most importantly, what does this have to do with curating or the curatorial? Reading an old daily broadsheet can actually give you a chill – whether out of fear or excitement – about how actuality no longer feels ‘actual’., NR: 336, Book ID: A Philosophy of Curating, Processed Text: today see thing differ whole matter read newspap past actual wise move act futur rather retrospect one possibl old news glimps futur importantli doe curatori read old daili broadsheet actual give chill whether fear excit actual longer feel actual
TEXT:  But what do we mean when we talk of actuality? In general, a newspaper puts forward a series of accounts, stories, narratives or commentaries about the previous day. As such, a broadsheet comes across as having a truth-value in as much as they pretend to portray the reality that is apparent immediately after the event occurred., NR: 337, Book ID: A Philosophy of Curating, Processed Text: mean talk actual gener newspap put forward seri account stori narr commentari previou day broadsheet come across truth valu much pretend portray realiti appar immedi event

TEXT:  By this I do not mean to say that – something we will all agree on – newspapers are always already biased. By this, I simply mean that newspapers are never able to grasp ‘a day’ from all its angles.

TEXT:  Both the present and the past are effectively ongoing constructs. This is what distinguishes newspapers from the live coverage of television or new-media newsfeeds (Twitter feeds, for example).

TEXT:  This does not express regret for the disappearance of newspapers or nostalgia for a world free of hyper-connectivity.

TEXT:  In this way, the events of old newspapers are basically hollowed out of their pressing demand and this emptiness reveals an ambiguity about the past. But how is one to understand this hollowness, this loss of importance, this emptiness? Instead of criticizing newspapers for being unable to perfectly freeze the urgency of events over time, it would probably be simpler to admit that their unsatisfactory account of time reveals instead an essential ambiguity about the present itself – whether lived or narrated a day or two years later., NR: 350, Book ID: A Philosophy of Curating, Processed Text: way event old newspap basic press demand empti ambigu past one understand hollow loss import empti instead newspap unabl perfectli freez urgenc event time would probabl simpler admit unsatisfactori account time instead essenti ambigu present whether live day two year later
TEXT:  Old newspapers reveal in fact that ‘actuality’ is effectively neither fully present nor totally absent, but both at the same time. As such, newspapers (old or new) are really an incredibly fuzzy boundary between a recognizable present (we all recognize events as having taken place) and an unrecognizable present that escapes representation (the impossibility of ascribing a fullness to these events)., NR: 351, Book ID: A Philosophy of Curating, Processed Text: old newspap reveal fact actual effect neither fulli present total absent time newspap old new realli incred fuzzi boundari recogniz present recogn event taken place unrecogniz present escap represent imposs full event
TEXT:  This can also be said in this way: newspapers lose their urgency because, as boundaries, they prevaricate between recognition and oblivion. Who, for example, has not expressed amazement at the unnecessary worries of previous centuries?

TEXT:  Old newspapers therefore tell us that the present is never simple or in tune with itself. There is always a breach in the present, something that never coheres; a lack of coherence that makes the present not only appear odd or awkward, but also unable to prevent its own disappearance., NR: 353, Book ID: A Philosophy of Curating, Processed Text: old newspap therefor tell present never simpl tune alway breach present someth never lack coher make present appear odd awkward also unabl prevent disappear
TEXT:  If this were not the case, the present would be unbearable, all of it gathering itself into memory. In this way, an old newspaper presents the past or the present as undecided, incomplete, frustratingly ambiguous and as a result of this, always ready to fall prey to an immemorial past., NR: 354, Book ID: A Philosophy of Curating, Processed Text: case present would unbear gather memori way old newspap present past present undecid incomplet ambigu result alway readi fall prey immemori past
TEXT:  There is a fabulous consequence to this: the ambiguous and unsatisfactory nature of old newspapers show that, basically, time is not a continuous flow of instant presents.

TEXT:  On the one hand, the dominance of neoliberal models of work that valorize hyper-production have meant that the demand is not simply to produce work, but also to find ways of funding it, to build up the environments that sustain it, to develop the discursive frames that open it up to other discussions, to endlessly network it with other work or other structures so as to expand its reach and seemingly give it additional credit for wider impact., NR: 374, Book ID: A Philosophy of Curating, Processed Text: one hand domin model work valor hyper product meant demand simpli produc work also find way build environ sustain develop discurs frame open discuss endlessli network work structur expand reach seemingli give addit credit impact

On occasion, within the discussions we are all part of, one will hear someone say the word ‘art’ and wonder: what on earth do they mean by that? •Do they mean ‘collectibles’ and ‘displayables’ and ‘catalogueables’ – objects and entities that can be known; that can be captured by these logics and fit neatly into the economies of institutional, foundation or private assemblies? •Or do they mean ‘artists’ who are working in the community or the field, trying to make complex the simple-minded politics of representation practised by the media – make them complex by layering intricate and contradictory strata and performances as the cumulative affect of a place or a group or an event? •Or do they mean the operations of new modes of research by which creative practitioners enter the arena of archival knowledges and posit other protagonists or other events, not main ones and not even marginal ones, but ones whose very articulation will trouble the subject of the archive, challenge its raison d’être – an innocent vegetable within the archive of a genocide, the design of a refugee tent rewriting the narrative of custodial roles, the aerial shot as the amalgam of centuries of governance through surveillance – non-symbolic and non-representational ways of navigating a cultural entry point into the production of knowledge., NR: 378, Book ID: A Philosophy of Curating, Processed Text: earth mean occas within discuss part one hear someon say word art wonder earth mean mean collect object entiti known logic fit neatli economi institut foundat privat assembl mean artist work commun field tri make complex simpl mind polit represent medium make complex intric contradictori stratum perform cumul affect place group event mean oper new mode research creativ practition enter arena archiv knowledg posit protagonist event main one even margin one one whose articul troubl subject archiv challeng innoc veget within archiv genocid design refuge tent narr custodi role aerial shot amalgam centuri govern surveil non symbol non way cultur entri point product knowledg

A proliferation has about it a measure of happy mutuality, a multiplicity of things coexisting and not disturbing one another, multiculturalism being a fabled example of such happy harmony! But the confusion about what the hell do they mean when they say ‘art’, the epistemological disorientation, has to imply a contested ground and if this ground is contested then each mode of understanding is grounded not just in vested interests – the neoliberal art market and its evil twin, cultural diplomacy – but in differing ways of knowing the world and its practices., NR: 395, Book ID: A Philosophy of Curating, Processed Text: limit multipl would simpler settl celebr multipl prolifer ha measur happi mutual multipl thing disturb one anoth fabl exampl happi harmoni confus hell mean say art epistemolog disorient ha impli ground ground mode understand ground interest art market evil twin cultur diplomaci way know world practic

TEXT:  So it is a question of the loss or the sacrifice of a way of thinking, as opposed to the cumulative proliferation of modes of operating. For both curating and the curatorial, the notion of an epistemological crisis is paramount, since they are largely fields grounded in a series of work-protocols with little cumulative history or a body of stable empirical or theoretical knowledge at their disposal., NR: 402, Book ID: A Philosophy of Curating, Processed Text: question loss sacrific way think oppos cumul prolifer mode oper curatori notion epistemolog crisi paramount sinc larg field ground seri work protocol littl cumul histori bodi stabl empir theoret knowledg dispos
TEXT:  Thus the temptation to hurriedly build up a body of named and applicable knowledge that would dignify the field is probably great. While such absences allow for a flexibility of operating and for the possibility of considerable invention, be it of archives or subjects or methodologies – there is an ongoing demand for an end product that coheres around an exhibition, around the act of revealing and concretizing, and that belies all the loosening that had gone into its curatorial operations., NR: 403, Book ID: A Philosophy of Curating, Processed Text: thu temptat hurriedli build bodi applic knowledg would dignifi field probabl great absenc allow flexibl oper possibl consider invent archiv subject methodolog ongo demand end product around exhibit around act reveal gone curatori oper

TEXT:  If curating can be the site of knowledge to rehearse its crises then it has the potential to make a contribution rather than enact representation. Going back to the question I began with, asking ‘What on earth do they mean when they say art?’, this epistemological crisis allows us not to choose between different definitions, but to make the curatorial the staging ground of the development of an idea or an insight., NR: 407, Book ID: A Philosophy of Curating, Processed Text: site knowledg rehears crisi ha potenti make contribut rather enact represent go back question earth mean say art epistemolog crisi choos differ definit make curatori stage ground develop idea insight

TEXT: 5 Dear Art, Yours Sincerely Natasa Ilić for What, How and for Whom / WHW In 1999, the artist Mladen Stilinović – who, since the 1970s, regularly works with language and its underlying ideological content – wrote a letter to art., NR: 431, Book ID: A Philosophy of Curating, Processed Text: dear art sincer artist sinc regularli work languag underli ideolog content wrote letter art
TEXT:  ‘Dear art’, he wrote, ‘I am writing you a love letter to cheer you up and encourage you to come and visit me some time.’1 His letter is a typical example of his approach to art; one which is based on simple execution, cheap, found materials and objects of everyday use., NR: 432, Book ID: A Philosophy of Curating, Processed Text: dear art wrote write love letter cheer encourag come visit time letter typic exampl approach art one base simpl execut cheap found materi object everyday use
TEXT:  His approach to art allows him, now for more than three decades, to engage with questions relating to artistic autonomy and how to retain independence from the system in terms of both the production and the presentation of artworks., NR: 433, Book ID: A Philosophy of Curating, Processed Text: approach art three decad engag question artist autonomi retain independ system term product present
TEXT:  Stilinović started his practice as part of what was then called the New Art Practice, a generation of artists who, on the Yugoslav art scene of the late 1960s and 1970s, challenged the officially accepted art of high modernism by questioning the ‘autonomy’ and ‘originality’ of art and by adopting a strategic use of media, creating new models of self-organization and taking the production of art outside of the confines of the institution in order to reach new audiences., NR: 434, Book ID: A Philosophy of Curating, Processed Text: practic part wa new art practic gener artist art scene late offici accept art high modern autonomi origin art strateg use medium new model self organ take product art outsid institut order reach new audienc
TEXT:  In the 1970s, he became a member of the Group of Six Artists (along with Boris Demur, Vlado Martek, Sven Stilinović, Željko Jerman and Fedor Vučemilović). This group of artists explored the ways in which conceptual art could achieve more autonomous modes of production and distribution., NR: 435, Book ID: A Philosophy of Curating, Processed Text: member group six artist along group artist way conceptu art could achiev autonom mode product distribut
TEXT:  This led them to present in public spaces what they called ‘exhibitions-actions’, collaborative events of exhibiting on streets, in parks, riverbanks, etc. In the 1980s, Stilinović was running the hugely important artist-run but city-owned space Gallery of Extended Media in Zagreb., NR: 436, Book ID: A Philosophy of Curating, Processed Text: led present public space exhibit action collabor event street park riverbank wa run huge import artist run citi space galleri extend medium
TEXT:  His engagement with the gallery ended in a highly symbolic moment when it became occupied by paramilitary troops thus marking for many artists the start of the war. In the early 1990s, he started organizing exhibitions in his apartment on a regular basis., NR: 437, Book ID: A Philosophy of Curating, Processed Text: engag galleri end highli symbol moment paramilitari troop thu mark mani artist start war earli exhibit apart regular basi
TEXT:  Like his previous gallery projects, his apartment exhibitions contain an implicit critique of official art institutions and rely on what Viktor Misiano in the context of the Russian ‘Apt Art’ movement called the ‘institutionalization of friendship’., NR: 438, Book ID: A Philosophy of Curating, Processed Text: like previou galleri project apart exhibit contain implicit critiqu offici art institut reli context apt art movement friendship
TEXT:  This approach implies creating a community that consciously works on redefining the rules of conduct and power relations in a specific art scene. Applied to the Croatian art scene of the 1990s, a scene characterized by a total lack of regard for a critical approach to artistic production and its contextualization, this approach left a strong mark on the younger generation of artists., NR: 439, Book ID: A Philosophy of Curating, Processed Text: approach commun conscious work rule conduct power relat specif art scene appli art scene scene total lack regard critic approach artist product approach left strong mark younger gener artist
TEXT:  Although he continued to exhibit in galleries and museums, Stilinović kept his critical stance, refusing to lapse in order to attain an unachievable purity in art, and always aware of his own complicity and involvement., NR: 440, Book ID: A Philosophy of Curating, Processed Text: although continu exhibit galleri museum kept critic stanc refus laps order attain unachiev puriti art alway awar complic involv
TEXT:  As he repeatedly points out, the role of the artist is to oppose art. In his love letter addressed to the art of 1999, the idea of opposing art is not an attempt to come up with a utopian notion of anti-art or to merge art and life., NR: 441, Book ID: A Philosophy of Curating, Processed Text: repeatedli point role artist oppos art love letter art idea oppos art attempt come utopian notion anti art merg art life
TEXT:  His real aim is not only to intimate a set of troubled, poetic, enigmatic and certainly more modest observations on the place of photography in contemporary artistic production, reception and distribution, but also to question the value of art, this value that, far too often, gets translated exclusively in terms of money, or as he puts it: ‘quick manipulation, quick money, quick oblivion’., NR: 442, Book ID: A Philosophy of Curating, Processed Text: real aim intim set poetic enigmat certainli modest observ place photographi contemporari artist product recept distribut also question valu art valu far often get exclus term money put quick manipul quick money quick oblivion
TEXT:  His thoughts touch upon photography and the way photography manages to usurp the place of art by providing a kind of trace ready to be converted into a marketable object (without mentioning the word ‘documentation’, one cannot help but imagine drab black-and-white photos trying hard to convey a sense of authenticity)., NR: 443, Book ID: A Philosophy of Curating, Processed Text: thought touch upon photographi way photographi usurp place art provid kind trace readi convert market object without word document one cannot help imagin drab black white photo tri hard convey sens authent
TEXT:  His point is that ‘naturally, there’s no memory of art, just like there is no memory of photography’. This does not lead him to a nostalgic longing for some fleeting moments that could not be captured and preserved in photography., NR: 444, Book ID: A Philosophy of Curating, Processed Text: point natur memori art like memori photographi doe lead nostalg long fleet moment could photographi
TEXT:  He also does not long for some kind of exclusivity or a supposed authenticity of first-hand direct experiences. His point in fact is an attempt to endorse instead the usurpation of photography as a way of hiding art, keeping it safe from prying eyes, recognizing it as a possibility of escaping and moving elsewhere., NR: 445, Book ID: A Philosophy of Curating, Processed Text: also doe long kind exclus suppos authent first hand direct experi point fact attempt endors instead usurp photographi way art keep safe pri eye possibl move elsewher

TEXT:  He writes: ‘Money is money. Art is art. This form of tautology satisfies many people and you are happy in this paralysis.’ In the postscript to his letter, he proposes to ‘cheer up’ art a little by putting self-censorship up for auction., NR: 448, Book ID: A Philosophy of Curating, Processed Text: money money art art form tautolog mani peopl happi paralysi postscript letter cheer art littl self censorship auction
TEXT:  In his view (a view also expressed through number of works that deal with the subject) self-censorship contributed greatly to the erosion of freedom that is particular to art. By suggesting auctioning self-censorship, he does not hope to get rid of freedom as much as he tries to contain or tame it., NR: 449, Book ID: A Philosophy of Curating, Processed Text: view view also express number work deal subject self censorship greatli eros freedom particular art suggest self censorship doe hope get rid freedom much tri contain tame
TEXT:  With a respectful acknowledgement and recognition of art, his aim is to probe once again the transaction between money and art: ‘Your name is value, not you.’ And indeed, his reading performance within the framework of the exhibition Worthless (Invaluable), The Concept of Value in Contemporary Art, curated by Carlos Basualdo in the Museum of Modern Art in Ljubljana in 2000, ended in a lively auction in which his self-censorship was exchanged for money offered by the highest bidder among an undaunted audience., NR: 450, Book ID: A Philosophy of Curating, Processed Text: respect recognit art aim probe transact money art name valu inde read perform within framework exhibit worthless invalu concept valu contemporari art museum modern art end live auction self censorship wa money highest bidder among undaunt audienc
TEXT:  (Alas, his action hardly exhausted the well of self-censorship.) Stilinović’s direct address to art – his love letter, as it were – was written at a time when the countries of the former Yugoslavia were progressively settling into a process of normalization., NR: 451, Book ID: A Philosophy of Curating, Processed Text: ala action hardli exhaust well self censorship direct address art love letter wa written time countri former progress settl process normal
TEXT:  This process was not only ideologically constructed (imposing a supposed normality in which social conflicts are harmonized and effects of war are swept under the carpet); it was also a genuine turn towards the possibilities offered by a non-dramatic pace of life-as-usual, a deeper assessment of the upheavals of the last decade, renewed contacts and a hope to regain a more solid ground., NR: 452, Book ID: A Philosophy of Curating, Processed Text: process wa ideolog impos suppos normal social conflict effect war swept carpet wa also genuin turn toward possibl non dramat pace life usual assess upheav last decad contact hope regain solid ground
TEXT:  Stilinović’s letter was also written at a time when the museum in Ljubljana was considered the only institution with an international arts programmes able to address not only its growing collection, but also the local context, and was therefore seen as something of a role model in comparison to the other sluggish and bureaucratized institutions of the other capital cities of the former Yugoslav republics., NR: 453, Book ID: A Philosophy of Curating, Processed Text: letter wa also written time museum wa consid institut intern art abl address grow collect also local context wa therefor seen someth role model comparison sluggish institut capit citi former republ

TEXT:  In 2011, upon the invitation to curate an exhibition in the newly opened Museum of Modern Art in Ljubljana, we – the curatorial collective What, How and for Whom ⁄ WHW – revisited Stilinović’s letter to art, hoping that his humorous approach, lack of cynicism and cautious irony could offer some kind of new orientation., NR: 459, Book ID: A Philosophy of Curating, Processed Text: upon invit curat exhibit newli museum modern art curatori collect letter art humor approach lack cynic cautiou ironi could offer kind new orient
TEXT:  This was a moment when our collective curatorial practice, after more than a decade of navigating pressures brought upon by the transition to a post-Fordist regime and avoiding betrayal, cooption and assimilation, grew somewhat disenchanted with the virtues of collective work and less assured of its mission to extricate the political potentials of art through projects that translated into different contexts of Croatian symptoms (i., NR: 460, Book ID: A Philosophy of Curating, Processed Text: wa moment collect curatori practic decad pressur brought upon transit post regim betray assimil grew somewhat virtu collect work less assur mission extric polit potenti art project differ context symptom

TEXT:  In his essay, ‘The Group as a Bearer of Ideas’, Kracauer writes about how the corporeality of a socially effective ‘idea’ is produced by the individualities making a group, carefully delineating ‘the communities of life and fate from those groups that actually bear the ideas’., NR: 464, Book ID: A Philosophy of Curating, Processed Text: essay group bearer idea corpor social effect idea produc individu make group care commun life fate group actual bear idea
TEXT: 2 His aim is to show how an ‘idea’ imposes itself on a group and how, in turn, it creates individualities. Kracauer’s account of how the group penetrates into reality and simultaneously experiences the power of that reality and how the logic of reality replaces what he calls ‘a logic of idea’ results in a rather pessimistic diagnosis., NR: 465, Book ID: A Philosophy of Curating, Processed Text: aim show idea group turn individu account group realiti simultan experi power realiti logic realiti call logic idea result rather pessimist diagnosi
TEXT:  According to him, a group either immerses itself in bitter inner conflicts between ‘reformist and radical wings’ or manages to get a grip on reality (thus securing their position and power), but only to lose it, transforming their original ‘idea’ into pure decoration., NR: 466, Book ID: A Philosophy of Curating, Processed Text: accord group either bitter inner conflict reformist radic wing get grip realiti thu posit power lose transform origin idea pure decor
TEXT:  As he says, in the latter case, the idea of the group ‘becomes pure decoration, ostentatious facade for a partly rotten interior (. . .) and the idea takes sublime revenge on the now powerful group’.3 With the growing recognition of our own curatorial work being the agent and symptom of the process of normalization we stood against, and with the realization that critique was being institutionalized and produced through self-referential fields of art, Kracauer’s questions on the duration and role of a group acquired for us a new urgency., NR: 467, Book ID: A Philosophy of Curating, Processed Text: say latter case idea group becom pure decor ostentati facad partli rotten interior idea take sublim reveng power group grow recognit curatori work agent symptom process normal stood realiz critiqu wa produc self referenti field art question durat role group acquir new urgenc

TEXT:  In another essay, ‘Those Who Wait’, Kracauer proposed to avoid the ‘either-or’ impasse that intellectuals as they relate to community leave us in, by endorsing a position of waiting. As he says: ‘Perhaps the only remaining attitude is one of waiting., NR: 469, Book ID: A Philosophy of Curating, Processed Text: anoth essay wait avoid either impass intellectu relat commun leav posit wait say perhap attitud one wait
TEXT:  One waits, and one’s waiting is a hesitant openness.’4 One could hardly be blamed for objecting that, for Kracauer and his generation, this waiting did not end up all too well. However, on a more positive note, the waiting he proposed could also be seen as a strategic move that is not simply passivity, but involves sustaining a certain openness in order to test the modalities of art production and critical thinking within and at the edges of the existing systems., NR: 470, Book ID: A Philosophy of Curating, Processed Text: one wait one wait hesit open one could hardli blame gener wait end well howev posit note wait could also seen strateg move simpli passiv sustain certain open order test modal art product critic think within edg system

TEXT:  The point was not to expect an answer, however promissory and instantly gratifying the answer might be, but to take the opportunity to take a break, catch a breath and start again from the beginning. What is it that we expect to get from art today? What is its promise, and what do we promise it in return? And what happens when this promise gets broken, betrayed or just plainly exhausted? As in several previous shows curated by WHW, the exhibition, planned for late 2012, will take its title from a work by Mladen Stilinović, ‘Dear Art’, thus insisting on the obstinate repetition of what has become the curatorial method., NR: 472, Book ID: A Philosophy of Curating, Processed Text: point wa expect answer howev promissori instantli gratifi answer might take opportun take break catch breath start begin expect get art today promis promis return promis get broken plainli exhaust sever previou show exhibit late take titl work dear art thu obstin repetit ha becom curatori method
TEXT:  Amidst the disillusionment created by the persistent feeling of failure (coming from the fact that attempts at a radical reconfiguration of art and cultural production in general always become almost immediately spectacularized) and thus relying on the very nature of art’s ‘inefficiency’, the exhibition Dear Art will therefore attempt to ask a brazen, and yet absolutely necessary question: Why do we still need art, and what is it that makes contemporary art actually and truly contemporary in society? The exhibition will attempt to address this issue by looking at art’s own reflection upon its practice., NR: 473, Book ID: A Philosophy of Curating, Processed Text: amidst disillusion persist feel failur come fact attempt radic art cultur product gener alway becom almost immedi thu natur art ineffici exhibit dear art therefor attempt ask brazen yet absolut necessari question still need art make contemporari art actual truli contemporari societi exhibit attempt address issu look art reflect upon practic

TEXT:  In any case, the exhibition will try to acknowledge the extremely limited material base of exhibition production, and bowing to Stilinović’s assessment that ‘the time has come for you (i.e. art) to hide and keep a low profile for a while’, it will most probably do so through a series of proposals abstaining from realization (hopefully) generously shared with us by artists, writers, curators, activists and theoreticians, whose works have inspired our practice throughout the years, and whenever heavy-handed treatment of copyrights allows for it, relying on copies and easily reproducible media., NR: 475, Book ID: A Philosophy of Curating, Processed Text: case exhibit tri acknowledg extrem limit materi base exhibit product bow assess time ha come art hide keep low profil probabl seri propos realiz hope gener artist writer curat activist theoretician whose work inspir practic throughout year whenev heavi hand treatment copyright copi easili reproduc medium

TEXT:  The starting point of philosophical discussion on this fable was certainly the way Heidegger referred to it in Being and Time when he unfolded his interpretation of (human) existence (‘Dasein’, ‘Being-in-the-world’) as a structural totality of ‘care’ rather than as being grounded in a sovereign, autonomous and constitutive ‘subject’., NR: 488, Book ID: A Philosophy of Curating, Processed Text: start point philosoph discuss fabl wa certainli way time unfold interpret human exist world structur total care rather ground sovereign autonom constitut subject
TEXT:  I want to pick up here, however, the thread of an observation by Hans Blumenberg.1 In his rereading of Hyginus’ fable, Blumenberg shrewdly pointed out that no indication whatsoever is given to explain why Cura had to first cross the river in order to mould her figure, while in all probability she could just as well have found clay on the riverside from where she came., NR: 489, Book ID: A Philosophy of Curating, Processed Text: want pick howev thread observ han fabl shrewdli point indic whatsoev given explain first cross river order mould figur probabl could well found clay riversid came
TEXT:  A curious fact, indeed. Not only because it may incite our curiosity about Cura’s river crossing itself (rather than what happened after it) but also because it might also tell us about Hyginus’ decision to omit giving an explanation for the importance of that crossing., NR: 490, Book ID: A Philosophy of Curating, Processed Text: curiou fact inde may incit curios river cross rather also might also tell decis omit give explan import cross
TEXT:  The fable also says that Cura’s name suggests that it might be ‘curious’, and even more so because we are told that this being becomes the creator and ‘possessor’ of another quite curious being, a mortal being called homo., NR: 491, Book ID: A Philosophy of Curating, Processed Text: fabl also say name might curiou even told becom creator possessor anoth quit curiou mortal homo
TEXT:  Given that both the omission and the reason for the omission need to be expounded, Blumenberg’s solution to the riddle is inevitably twofold. On the one hand, he explains that the significance of Cura’s crossing of the river is based on an early Gnostic myth for which, as opposed to older Greek notions of creation, a moment of self-mirroring is necessarily inscribed in the very act of creation: according to this myth, Cura first had to see her own image reflected on the surface of the water and simultaneously perceive the clay on the river’s ground, as only then could she be driven to take up the clay on the banks in order to shape a creature ‘in her own image’., NR: 492, Book ID: A Philosophy of Curating, Processed Text: given omiss reason omiss need solut riddl inevit twofold one hand signific cross river base earli gnostic myth oppos older notion creation moment self necessarili act creation accord myth first see imag reflect surfac water simultan perceiv clay river ground could driven take clay bank order shape creatur imag
TEXT:  On the other hand, when it comes to explaining the fable’s silence on that crucial point, Blumenberg first speculates that the reason for this silence could be that Hyginus considered it no longer appropriate for an allegory about care and concern to be characterized by what might also be understood as an act of mere vanity or ‘narcissism’., NR: 493, Book ID: A Philosophy of Curating, Processed Text: hand come explain fabl silenc crucial point first reason silenc could consid longer appropri allegori care concern might also understood act mere vaniti narciss
TEXT:  In this respect, Blumenberg goes as far as to propose that Cura would have to be imagined as ‘marked by sorrow’ rather than beautiful. This being stated, he quickly moves on to suggest a second possible explanation: Hyginus wanted his ‘lowly heroine’ Cura to take the place of the titan Prometheus; yet as Cura’s capacity for creation was dependent on a model or prefiguration and thus could be considered to be comparatively inferior in contrast to the latter’s unrestricted way of shaping humans out of clay, the author of the fable preferred to keep silent about this dependency, for it would also have alluded to a ‘low’ origin of humanity., NR: 494, Book ID: A Philosophy of Curating, Processed Text: respect go far propos would mark sorrow rather beauti state quickli move suggest second possibl explan lowli heroin take place yet capac creation wa depend model prefigur thu could consid compar inferior contrast latter unrestrict way shape human clay author fabl prefer keep silent depend would also low origin human
TEXT:  I will not discuss all of this here in detail, even though a whole set of evaluations might attract our critical attention. Yet, on a more general level, an element of interest in Blumenberg’s suggestions can be seen precisely in the way they highlight the relative lowliness of Cura, such as her double inferiority in relation to her Greek precursors; the powerful, if self-indulgent, demiurge Prometheus and the beautiful, if self-entangled, demigod Narcissus., NR: 495, Book ID: A Philosophy of Curating, Processed Text: discu detail even though whole set evalu might attract critic attent yet gener level element interest suggest seen precis way highlight rel lowli doubl inferior relat precursor power self indulg demiurg beauti self entangl demigod
TEXT:  Indeed, the main thread of Hyginus’ fable tells a story of ‘lowliness’, despite – or perhaps rather accentuated by – the encounter of gods it describes: even the earth that homo is made out of is no longer the primeval Earth that may arise and present its mighty claims, but just a profane and dumb piece of soil, humus, that immediately evokes the contingent and transient character of Cura’s creature., NR: 496, Book ID: A Philosophy of Curating, Processed Text: inde main thread fabl tell stori lowli despit perhap rather encount god even earth homo made longer primev earth may aris present mighti claim profan dumb piec soil humu immedi conting transient charact creatur
TEXT:  But there is something else that is of interest and that I would like to address in the form of some questions: What if we took Hyginus’ silence about the significance of Cura’s river crossing not so much as imposing on us the task of reconstructing what was omitted by an author who had invented a figure that didn’t quite fit any longer into the existing imaginaries – but rather as an invitation to deploy our own imaginative capacities in order to somehow re-narrate Cura’s story, and especially its unaccounted part? What if we took advantage of that silence in order to disengage the fable, and – even more so – ourselves, from the suggestive and persistent regimes of both ‘high’ creation or ‘high’ origins and self-mirroring (which alone cast a shadow of ‘lowliness’ on Cura and her offspring, and at once involve them in an ambivalent, if not vicious circle of representation and creation)? What if we tried to free our understanding of Cura’s fable from the grammar of immoderate self-indulgence and un-convivial self-entanglement, and hence also from the insinuation that an existence of ‘care’ would have to result in being ‘inferior in capacity’ or ‘marked by sorrow’, rather than powerful and beautiful? And what if we did so by referring the fable to some of Cura’s descendants, specifically those who might not owe their existence to Cura’s ‘own image’, yet all the more hauntingly evoke her name: ‘curators’? * * * The first ‘curators’ seem to have appeared, under the name of curatores rei publicae, around the year of 100, about a century after Hyginus had written his fable., NR: 497, Book ID: A Philosophy of Curating, Processed Text: someth els interest would like address form question took silenc signific river cross much impos task wa author figur quit fit longer imaginari rather invit deploy imagin capac order somehow narrat stori especi unaccount part took advantag silenc order disengag fabl even suggest persist regim high creation high origin self alon cast shadow lowli offspr involv ambival viciou circl represent creation tri free understand fabl grammar immoder self indulg convivi self entangl henc also insinu exist care would result inferior capac mark sorrow rather power beauti fabl descend specif might owe exist imag yet hauntingli evok name curat first curat seem name around year centuri written fabl

TEXT:  Are we then to consider ‘curators’ not only as descendants of Hyginus’ Cura, but also as her modern manifestations? Crossing many rivers and even oceans (albeit not necessarily in person, as modern times require an enhanced division of labour)? Producing, out of what they can find, figures identified with the name homo (even though the material is no longer clay and the creation no longer quite as inceptual as Cura’s, but rather drawing upon the multiplicity of existing images of homo and upon what is conceived of as the creativity of the human imagination)? And yet still perhaps dependent on a moment or momentum of self-mirroring that is better kept out of the narration, as it could bear witness either to the limits of the capacities of the ‘curatorial’ or to the somehow inappropriate traces of self-indulgence and self-entanglement inscribed in them? ‘Something’s wrong,’ Blumenberg wrote when contemplating the course of Hyginus’ fable., NR: 508, Book ID: A Philosophy of Curating, Processed Text: consid curat descend also modern manifest cross mani river even ocean albeit necessarili person modern time requir enhanc divis labour find figur name homo even though materi longer clay creation longer quit rather draw upon multipl imag homo upon creativ human imagin yet still perhap depend moment momentum self better kept narrat could bear wit either limit capac curatori somehow inappropri trace self indulg self entangl someth wrong wrote cours fabl
TEXT:  And it appears as if this assessment could cogently also be applied to Cura’s later descendants and avatars. But what is it that’s wrong, after all?

I wouldn’t feel encouraged to take the second suggestion as an actual possibility, if it were not for the fact that the most recent prominence of ‘curators’ appears to be closely linked to an open series of investigations and interrogations into various components of Cura’s story and curators’ history, simultaneously manifesting a desire to break free from the frameworks set up by those components in order to give new accounts of care and concern., NR: 510, Book ID: A Philosophy of Curating, Processed Text: someth els taken place river cross someth differ necessarili elus yet presum decis glimps reflect imag taken model creation feel take second suggest actual possibl fact recent promin curat close link open seri investig interrog variou compon stori curat histori simultan desir break free framework set compon order give new account care concern

TEXT:  Drawing on Alfred Gell’s concept of ‘art as agency’, which states that art has the power not only to passively represent the world, but also to act, ‘curatorial agency’ assumes in the same vein that the curator is no longer considered to be the ‘author’ of an exhibition or a mere presenter of an already existing set of artistic concepts and projects., NR: 560, Book ID: A Philosophy of Curating, Processed Text: draw gell concept art agenc state art ha power passiv repres world also act curatori agenc vein curat longer consid author exhibit mere present alreadi set artist concept project

While the former is a pragmatic decision not only to make a living out of one of the ‘sexiest’ professions available in the international art world (one that focuses on singling out emergent art concepts, art objects and artists who produce either those concepts or objects), the latter is fundamentally related to one’s own position in the world as a thinking subject., NR: 566, Book ID: A Philosophy of Curating, Processed Text: way start becom curat ha noth becom curat former pragmat decis make live one profess avail intern art world one focu emerg art concept art object artist produc either concept object latter fundament relat one posit world think subject

TEXT: 8 An Exhausted Curating Leire Vergara Being exhausted is much more than being tired,1 clarifies Gilles Deleuze at the beginning of The Exhausted, an essay written as an expansion of the ideas developed in his previous work ‘From Sacher-Masoch to Masochism’ of 1961., NR: 579, Book ID: A Philosophy of Curating, Processed Text: exhaust exhaust much tire begin exhaust essay written expans idea previou work masoch
TEXT:  With this sentence, Deleuze makes clear from the start that, for him, someone exhausted is not a tired person, that is to say, someone who is willing to rest in order to recover the strength to keep going, but on the contrary, someone who cannot go on any longer and for that reason turns his own state of collapse into the opportunity of reassessing the limits of any given convention., NR: 580, Book ID: A Philosophy of Curating, Processed Text: sentenc make clear start someon exhaust tire person say someon will rest order recov strength keep go contrari someon cannot longer reason turn state collaps opportun limit given convent
TEXT:  In this respect, the exhausted is not a passive agent who suffers from the alienation of a demanding situation, but an active one, capable of interrupting a set of conditions and creating new forms of engagement with reality., NR: 581, Book ID: A Philosophy of Curating, Processed Text: respect exhaust passiv agent alien demand situat activ one capabl interrupt set condit new form engag realiti
TEXT:  In this way, the oppositional character of the concept of exhaustion for Deleuze does not lie in its own capacity of interrupting a process, but in the actual potentiality of examining the way ‘language states and names the possible’., NR: 582, Book ID: A Philosophy of Curating, Processed Text: way opposit charact concept exhaust doe lie capac interrupt process actual potenti examin way languag state name possibl
TEXT: 2 In order to illustrate the differences between the tired and the exhausted, Deleuze refers to Quad and Ghost Trio, two plays written by Samuel Beckett for television in 1984 and 1975 respectively. His first example is Quad., NR: 583, Book ID: A Philosophy of Curating, Processed Text: order illustr differ tire exhaust quad ghost trio two play written televis respect first exampl quad
TEXT:  In this piece, the elements are simple: four characters (wrapped in cowls) occupy a quadrilateral empty space. The action simply consists of a series of combined movements driven by the actors who, following a strict choreography, traverse the small stage producing a repetitive outline that highlights the vertices of the space, while avoiding the centre., NR: 584, Book ID: A Philosophy of Curating, Processed Text: piec element simpl four charact wrap cowl occupi quadrilater empti space action simpli seri combin movement driven actor follow strict choreographi travers small stage repetit outlin highlight vertex space
TEXT:  The obsessive choreography makes clear the play’s intention: that of generating exhaustion by using up all possible combinations of movements made available by the space. In this sense, the piece ‘exhausts itself in exhausting the possible and vice-versa’., NR: 585, Book ID: A Philosophy of Curating, Processed Text: obsess choreographi make clear play intent gener exhaust possibl combin movement made avail space sens piec exhaust exhaust possibl vice
TEXT: 3 His second example, Ghost Trio, is also concerned with space, and with exhausting its potentialities. For that, Beckett employs the strategy of fragmenting the stage into three elements: a door, a window and a pallet., NR: 586, Book ID: A Philosophy of Curating, Processed Text: second exampl ghost trio also concern space exhaust potenti employ strategi stage three element door window pallet
TEXT:  From this division, a chain of close-ups generates a repetitive filmic passage from one element to the other, thus producing a strong dependency between all three elements. The fragmentation of the space in this piece is interpreted by Deleuze as a resistance against falling into the strict rules of representation by disconnecting the parts from the whole as a way of distinguishing and finding new connections., NR: 587, Book ID: A Philosophy of Curating, Processed Text: divis chain close repetit filmic passag one element thu strong depend three element fragment space piec resist fall strict rule represent part whole way distinguish find new connect
TEXT:  In fact, the strategy employed in Ghost Trio seems to break down the way plays were staged at the time for television: pretending as if the recording cameras were not there. Beckett’s piece exploits the possibilities offered by both devices, theatre and television, questioning thus their own staging constraints and using this relational condition as a new potentiality., NR: 588, Book ID: A Philosophy of Curating, Processed Text: fact strategi employ ghost trio break way play stage time televis record camera piec exploit possibl devic televis thu stage constraint relat condit new potenti
TEXT:  Following the above, Deleuze’s strategies for the exhausted should be considered more than a simple impulse to block an ongoing dynamics. The exhausted, as a method, consists in examining the procedures of production and representation that comprises any cultural practice., NR: 589, Book ID: A Philosophy of Curating, Processed Text: follow strategi exhaust consid simpl impuls block ongo dynam exhaust method examin procedur product represent cultur practic
TEXT:  In this sense, the exhausted surpasses the act of saturating what is offered as possible on the cultural sphere, in order to reach a limit and thus renew the sphere’s given conditions. In that respect, an exhausted approach could help to reassess any contemporary mechanism that may entrap a cultural practice., NR: 590, Book ID: A Philosophy of Curating, Processed Text: sens exhaust act possibl cultur sphere order reach limit thu renew sphere given condit respect exhaust approach could help reassess contemporari mechan may entrap cultur practic
TEXT:  To transpose this reflection onto the field of curating contemporary art exhibitions means to consider reassessing the conditions in which this practice operates. It is in this context that I would like to propose the idea of an ‘exhausted curating’., NR: 591, Book ID: A Philosophy of Curating, Processed Text: transpos reflect onto field contemporari art exhibit mean consid condit practic context would like propos idea exhaust
TEXT:  An ‘exhausted curating’ should be about demanding a new dynamics capable of setting in motion an inner reflexivity of its working procedures as well as its public contexts. In other words, an ‘exhausted curating’ should be about acknowledging what is considered today to be possible within the field., NR: 592, Book ID: A Philosophy of Curating, Processed Text: exhaust demand new dynam capabl set motion inner reflex work procedur well public context word exhaust consid today possibl within field
TEXT:  Not unlike Deleuze’s proposition for the exhausted, that is, someone who is caught by exhaustion is also able to exhaust its own exhaustion, an ‘exhausted curating’ should unravel its own exhaustion as a way of stimulating new possible forms of curatorial production., NR: 593, Book ID: A Philosophy of Curating, Processed Text: unlik proposit exhaust someon caught exhaust also abl exhaust exhaust exhaust unravel exhaust way new possibl form curatori product
TEXT:  To address the curatorial outside of the proper limits of curating entails expanding its privileged domain of visibility: the exhibition. In order to do so requires that a curatorial practice steps into other fields of knowledge and creates new possibilities for thinking the relationships between objects, bodies, subjects, politics and display., NR: 594, Book ID: A Philosophy of Curating, Processed Text: address curatori outsid proper limit entail expand privileg domain visibl exhibit order curatori practic step field knowledg new possibl think relationship object bodi subject polit display
TEXT: 4 At first sight, the distinction between curating and the curatorial could be as negligible as the tired and the exhausted, despite the fact that the demand for this differentiation offers the opportunity to claim new commitments to the practice., NR: 595, Book ID: A Philosophy of Curating, Processed Text: first sight distinct curatori could neglig tire exhaust despit fact demand differenti offer opportun claim new commit practic
TEXT:  However, in order to trigger the difference between both procedures, there should be a moment of disruption, a purposeful stoppage that intentionally alters the conventional flow of curating. A similar logic can be recognized in the work of André Lepecki entitled Exhausting Dance, dedicated to formulating a new understanding of the work of some contemporary choreographers, namely, the question of the identity of dance as a being-in-flow., NR: 596, Book ID: A Philosophy of Curating, Processed Text: howev order trigger differ procedur moment disrupt purpos stoppag intent convent flow similar logic work exhaust danc new understand work contemporari choreograph name question ident danc flow

TEXT:  This exhaustion corresponds to the breakdown of a preconceived idea from early modernity that dance and movement are bound together and that, as a consequence, the body of the dancer is a total-being-into-movement., NR: 598, Book ID: A Philosophy of Curating, Processed Text: exhaust breakdown preconceiv idea earli modern danc movement bound togeth consequ bodi dancer total movement
TEXT:  Lepecki acknowledges this association as a modern symptom, taking into consideration that the modern project is fundamentally kinetic. So the idea of exhausting the constituent element of dance means in fact directing a critique towards the production of a disciplined body that moves according to strict commands., NR: 599, Book ID: A Philosophy of Curating, Processed Text: associ modern symptom take consider modern project fundament kinet idea exhaust constitu element danc mean fact critiqu toward product bodi move accord strict command
TEXT:  This idea might be difficult to imagine, but this is really an unavoidable requirement for allowing self-reflexivity in choreographic practice, which, as Lepecki argues, is really a form of betrayal. (Lepecki doesn’t think this is a betrayal, but the majority of practitioners from contemporary choreography understand it as such., NR: 600, Book ID: A Philosophy of Curating, Processed Text: idea might difficult imagin realli unavoid requir self reflex choreograph practic realli form betray think betray major practition contemporari choreographi understand
TEXT: ) So what about saying something like this: What seems to be an unavoidable requirement for allowing self-reflexivity in choreographic practice can be broadly understood not as a form of betrayal, but as disloyalty., NR: 601, Book ID: A Philosophy of Curating, Processed Text: say someth like unavoid requir self reflex choreograph practic broadli understood form betray disloyalti
TEXT:  Disloyalty provokes choreography to neglect movement as its major defining character in order to highlight its linguistic condition. In fact, it is this particular troubling disassociation that offers the opportunity to conceive ‘the body not just as a self-contained and closed being, that follows directions within the choreography text, but as an active linguistic entity capable of setting up dynamic systems of exchange’., NR: 602, Book ID: A Philosophy of Curating, Processed Text: disloyalti choreographi neglect movement major charact order highlight linguist condit fact particular troubl disassoci offer opportun conceiv bodi self close direct within choreographi text activ linguist entiti capabl set dynam system exchang

TEXT:  She introduces the transformations that contemporary choreography has gone through since the 1990s, when choreographic practices emancipated themselves from modern dance. For Cvejić, choreography’s emancipation is promoted by the influence received from the visual arts and from a deepening interest in the theory and philosophy that have influenced art production since the 1960s., NR: 604, Book ID: A Philosophy of Curating, Processed Text: transform contemporari choreographi ha gone sinc choreograph practic modern danc choreographi emancip influenc receiv visual art deepen interest theori philosophi art product sinc
TEXT:  However, for the theorist, choreography will actually gain autonomy through a direct speech act that proclaims this practice to be there where it was not expected to be. In her opinion, to state publicly ‘this is choreography and this is not’ implies a positive exercise that goes beyond the dialectical critique against the theatrical apparatus where supposedly dance and choreography are bound to happen., NR: 605, Book ID: A Philosophy of Curating, Processed Text: howev theorist choreographi actual gain autonomi direct speech act practic wa opinion state publicli choreographi posit exercis go beyond dialect critiqu theatric apparatu supposedli danc choreographi bound happen
TEXT:  This means that Cvejić’s approach tries to go beyond the mere logic of taking exhaustion as the critical strategy to help her substitute one representational regime for another. In this respect, her reflections distrust the type of negative critique that argues that something should be dismantled, namely the theatrical apparatus, the spectator or the movement of the performer., NR: 606, Book ID: A Philosophy of Curating, Processed Text: mean approach tri beyond mere logic take exhaust critic strategi help substitut one regim anoth respect reflect distrust type neg critiqu someth name theatric apparatu spectat movement perform
TEXT:  Moreover for the theorist, the promise of exhausting the old technologies in order to gain new ones should not be enough, at least, not if this does not redirect the critique into experimental and creative propositions capable of producing new conditions, practices, forms of work and life for contemporary choreography., NR: 607, Book ID: A Philosophy of Curating, Processed Text: moreov theorist promis exhaust old technolog order gain new one enough least doe redirect critiqu experiment creativ proposit capabl new condit practic form work life contemporari choreographi

TEXT:  In choreography, this means not only to specifically undo the rules, gestures and behavioural protocols established for the stage, but also to allow for the awakening of a consciousness of the processes of subjectification that give shape to the subject involved in the practice., NR: 609, Book ID: A Philosophy of Curating, Processed Text: choreographi mean specif undo rule gestur protocol establish stage also allow awaken conscious process give shape subject involv practic
TEXT:  André Lepecki in Exhausting Dance defends the argument of considering modernity as a form of subjectivity. For him, ‘modernity’s periodization would be predicated on identifying not a particular period, nor a particular geography, but processes of subjectification that produce and reproduce this particular form., NR: 610, Book ID: A Philosophy of Curating, Processed Text: exhaust danc argument consid modern form subject modern would particular period particular geographi process produc reproduc particular form
TEXT: ’7 In addition, to admit that modernity produces specific forms of subjectivity entails acknowledging the elements and proceedings that conform to it, for example, the way that subjectivity is entrapped within the solipsistic captivity of the individual subject., NR: 611, Book ID: A Philosophy of Curating, Processed Text: addit admit modern produc specif form subject entail element proceed conform exampl way subject within solipsist captiv individu subject
TEXT:  In fact, Lepecki asks in his book to concretely disassociate the term ‘subjectivity’ from the fixed notion of ‘the subject’. For this, he puts the stress on understanding subjectivity as a dynamic concept, capable of generating modes of relationality, such as, for example, political, affective or choreographic., NR: 612, Book ID: A Philosophy of Curating, Processed Text: fact book concret disassoci term subject fix notion subject put stress understand subject dynam concept capabl gener mode relation exampl polit affect choreograph
TEXT:  In other words, he proposes to conceive subjectivity as the possibility for life to be constantly invented and reinvented. As is well known, the time frame of modernity is arbitrary and malleable. Raymond Williams, in his text When was Modernism?, introduces the notion of self-consciousness to the debate on the modern,8 requesting us to pay attention to a tendency that insists on the constant reassessment of the critique of modernity., NR: 613, Book ID: A Philosophy of Curating, Processed Text: word conceiv subject possibl life constantli well known time frame modern arbitrari malleabl text wa modern notion self conscious debat modern pay attent tendenc constant reassess critiqu modern
TEXT:  In this work, Williams rejects anchoring the term ‘modern’ to a rigid period of time and the consequent fixing of modernism within the institutionalized cultural forms that have been conventionally agreed upon., NR: 614, Book ID: A Philosophy of Curating, Processed Text: work reject term modern rigid period time consequ fix modern within cultur form convent agre upon
TEXT:  In his own view, these forms ‘quickly lost [their] anti-bourgeois stance, and achieved comfortable integration into the new international capitalism’.9 For this reason, he refuses to fix modernity in order to regain its original critical force beyond the modern formal rhetoric., NR: 615, Book ID: A Philosophy of Curating, Processed Text: view form quickli lost anti bourgeoi stanc comfort integr new intern capit reason refus fix modern order regain origin critic forc beyond modern formal rhetor
TEXT:  With this actual refusal of establishing a canonical time for modernism, Williams tries to reactive and resituate the forgotten aims of the modernist project, which was in fact driven by a fierce attempt to break down bourgeois forms of life., NR: 616, Book ID: A Philosophy of Curating, Processed Text: actual refus canon time modern tri reactiv forgotten aim modernist project wa fact driven fierc attempt break bourgeoi form life
TEXT:  A spatial manifestation crucial to modernism is the exhibition space. The white cube, this space where windows have been obliterated, walls whitened, floors polished and light sources placed on the ceiling, exemplifies the process of isolating art exhibition spaces from the outside world., NR: 617, Book ID: A Philosophy of Curating, Processed Text: spatial manifest crucial modern exhibit space white cube space window wall floor polish light sourc ceil process isol art exhibit space outsid world
TEXT:  This separation of the exhibition space has privileged the aesthetization of the formal qualities of life in its transference to the art object. However, as Brian O’Doherty suggests,10 it is precisely the confinement of the exhibition space to that modern canon that is the actual trigger for the formation of a body of reflexivity around the work of art and its public exhibiting constraints., NR: 618, Book ID: A Philosophy of Curating, Processed Text: separ exhibit space ha privileg formal qualiti life transfer art object howev precis confin exhibit space modern canon actual trigger format bodi reflex around work art public constraint

TEXT:  In this respect, the debates and artistic practices that have taken place since the 1960s as a critical response to the white cube, struggle to break with that supposed neutrality. In this way, the critique that has emerged since the irruption of the white cube should still claim a rupture with the bourgeois ideology implicit in the neutral form that shapes the white cube., NR: 620, Book ID: A Philosophy of Curating, Processed Text: respect debat artist practic taken place sinc critic respons white cube struggl break suppos neutral way critiqu ha sinc irrupt white cube still claim ruptur bourgeoi ideolog implicit neutral form shape white cube
TEXT:  However, the fact is that time and again, its qualities, whiteness and silence, attempt to erase the evolution of that struggle. Consequently, this constant erasure can be acknowledged as a true exhaustion of the actual possibilities of the practice of curating, an exhaustion that calls for a disruption in the aim of allowing new proceedings within the visual regime of the exhibition., NR: 621, Book ID: A Philosophy of Curating, Processed Text: howev fact time qualiti white silenc attempt eras evolut struggl consequ constant erasur acknowledg true exhaust actual possibl practic exhaust call disrupt aim new proceed within visual regim exhibit
TEXT:  This idea of envisioning a disruption within the practice of curating can perhaps now be stated under the notion of ‘the curatorial’. However, it is worth situating the task of the curatorial within the need of transcending the dialectical critique towards its devices, in the same way that Bojana Cvejić has rightly asked of contemporary choreographic practices., NR: 622, Book ID: A Philosophy of Curating, Processed Text: idea disrupt within practic perhap state notion curatori howev worth task curatori within need transcend dialect critiqu toward devic way ha rightli contemporari choreograph practic
TEXT:  In this sense, an ‘exhausted curating’ should make way for the curatorial as a creative disruption within the procedures that constrain the artistic experience. This means that the artistic experience should imply a process of actualization of all those qualities of the work of art discarded by bourgeois rhetoric., NR: 623, Book ID: A Philosophy of Curating, Processed Text: sens exhaust make way curatori creativ disrupt within procedur constrain artist experi mean artist experi impli process actual qualiti work art bourgeoi rhetor
TEXT:  With this line of thought, it is perhaps interesting to recall again Deleuze’s strategy of connection and disconnection proposed in The Exhausted with the example of Beckett’s play Ghost Trio. It is indeed interesting to see how the philosopher claims a continuity of production beyond a discontinuous reality, as if he was proposing an inseparable alliance between continuing and disrupting., NR: 624, Book ID: A Philosophy of Curating, Processed Text: line thought perhap interest recal strategi connect disconnect exhaust exampl play ghost trio inde interest see philosoph claim continu product beyond discontinu realiti wa insepar allianc

TEXT: 9 Eros, Plague, Olfaction: Three Allegories of the Curatorial Jenny Doussan Autistic doxology If, as has been suggested, we use the term ‘spectacle’ for the extreme phase of capitalism in which we are now living, in which everything is exhibited in its separation from itself, the spectacle and consumption are two sides of a single impossibility of using., NR: 630, Book ID: A Philosophy of Curating, Processed Text: ero plagu olfact three allegori curatori jenni autist doxolog ha use term spectacl extrem phase capit live everyth separ spectacl consumpt two side singl imposs
TEXT:  What cannot be used is, as such, given over to consumption or to spectacular exhibitions. Giorgio Agamben1 In his essay ‘Notes on Politics’, Giorgio Agamben states, ‘The plane of immanence on which the new political experience is constituted is the terminal expropriation of language carried out by the spectacular state., NR: 631, Book ID: A Philosophy of Curating, Processed Text: cannot use given consumpt spectacular exhibit essay note polit state plane imman new polit experi termin expropri languag carri spectacular state
TEXT: ’ Developing a sentiment expressed in a slightly earlier text, he advises that the task at hand is to seize the positive possibility within the conditions of living in the spectacular state – our newly acquired access to communicability in its spectacular expropriation as bare language – and use this possibility against it., NR: 632, Book ID: A Philosophy of Curating, Processed Text: sentiment express slightli text task hand seiz posit possibl within condit live spectacular state newli acquir access communic spectacular expropri bare languag use possibl

TEXT:  Agamben has more recently expressed this formula in an imagistic rather than linguistic lexicon with an embodied visuality that addresses these very same concerns of, to employ his later terminology, the capture of the spectacle’s apparatus., NR: 634, Book ID: A Philosophy of Curating, Processed Text: ha recent express formula imagist rather linguist lexicon visual address concern employ later terminolog captur spectacl apparatu
TEXT:  In ‘The Glorious Body’, he articulates the spectacular in terms of the corporeal and questions whether, in the theologically grounded conception of the resurrected soma, there can today be thought a ‘different possible use’ for the body., NR: 635, Book ID: A Philosophy of Curating, Processed Text: gloriou bodi spectacular term corpor question whether theolog ground concept soma today thought differ possibl use bodi
TEXT:  Rather than condemning the spectacular function of glory that separates the body’s organs from their vital functions into an exhibition value, Agamben instead suggests a dualistic mode of glory: Just as in advertisements or pornography, where the simulacra of merchandise or bodies exalt their appeal precisely to the extent that they cannot be used, but only exhibited, so in the resurrection the idle sexual organs will display the potentiality, or the virtue, of procreation., NR: 636, Book ID: A Philosophy of Curating, Processed Text: rather condemn spectacular function glori separ bodi organ vital function exhibit valu instead dualist mode glori advertis pornographi simulacrum merchandis bodi exalt appeal precis extent cannot use resurrect idl sexual organ display potenti virtu procreat
TEXT:  The glorious body is an ostensive body whose functions are not executed but rather displayed. Glory, in this sense, is in solidarity with inoperativity.3 This separation of the potential body from the functioning body, however, only permits rather than guarantees a new use., NR: 637, Book ID: A Philosophy of Curating, Processed Text: gloriou bodi ostens bodi whose function execut rather display glori sens solidar separ potenti bodi bodi howev permit rather guarante new use
TEXT:  Despite its formal identity with inoperativity, Agamben, echoing his claim some 15 years prior of the capture of the sovereign ban, alerts us to the danger of the liturgical sense of glory that ‘does nothing other than incessantly capture inoperativity and displace it into the sphere of worship’., NR: 638, Book ID: A Philosophy of Curating, Processed Text: despit formal ident claim year prior captur sovereign ban alert danger liturg sens glori doe noth incessantli captur displac sphere worship
TEXT: 4 Despite its liberation from instrumentality, this glorious body serves to invigorate the apparatus rather than enjoy itself in itself. The new use that Agamben thus attempts to devise must exclude instrumentality., NR: 639, Book ID: A Philosophy of Curating, Processed Text: despit liber instrument gloriou bodi serf invigor apparatu rather enjoy new use thu attempt devis must exclud instrument
TEXT:  In this difficult formulation, not only must the new use of an entity – or in this case a body – differ from its prior functionality whose exhibition value is retained, it must itself be non-instrumental, ‘not directed towards an end’., NR: 640, Book ID: A Philosophy of Curating, Processed Text: difficult formul must new use entiti case bodi differ prior function whose exhibit valu must non instrument direct toward end
TEXT:  Likening the proposed new use of the ‘naked, simple human body’ to the ‘illegible writing’ of dance, he asserts, ‘The glorious body is not some other body, more agile and beautiful, more luminous and spiritual; it is the body itself, at the moment when inoperativity removes the spell from it and opens it to a new possible common use., NR: 641, Book ID: A Philosophy of Curating, Processed Text: new use nake simpl human bodi illeg write danc gloriou bodi bodi agil beauti lumin spiritu bodi moment remov spell open new possibl common use
TEXT: ’5 It would then seem that, locked in an inverted sequence, new use must always remain potential rather than actual to avoid the capture of the apparatus. While Agamben insists that this new use must be ‘common’, it nonetheless tends towards self-gratification, his example of the glorious non-procreative genitals being a case in point., NR: 642, Book ID: A Philosophy of Curating, Processed Text: would seem lock invert sequenc new use must alway remain potenti rather actual avoid captur apparatu new use must common nonetheless toward self gratif exampl gloriou non procr genit case point
TEXT:  This inclination, evidenced elsewhere by his cryptic advocacy of the happy life, has led some to question the real difference between Agamben’s thought and that of the ‘contemporary democratic materialism’ that he criticizes, accusing him of a ‘dandyish semi-autism’., NR: 643, Book ID: A Philosophy of Curating, Processed Text: inclin elsewher cryptic advocaci happi life ha led question real differ thought contemporari democrat materi dandyish semi autism
TEXT: 6 Though his critique of instrumentality as the expropriation of means and evacuation of content in the capture of the apparatus may be the centrepiece of the programmatic aspect of his philosophy, it begs the question of how its deactivation could be universally implemented, and why? Must we all become bulimics, deactivating the instrument of nourishment to render eating inoperative, exposing its exhibition value as pure means with the hope of putting it to new use?7 In this shift from the linguistic to the corporeal, Agamben seems not to have established any distinction of note between the two., NR: 644, Book ID: A Philosophy of Curating, Processed Text: though critiqu instrument expropri mean evacu content captur apparatu may programmat aspect philosophi question deactiv could univers must becom bulim instrument nourish render eat inop exhibit valu pure mean hope new use shift linguist corpor establish distinct note two
TEXT:  Despite a more precise delineation of the exact mechanism of the apparatus and an exposition of its simultaneously emancipatory and annihilative double valence, there is ultimately little difference between the homo sacer and the glorious body, at least in terms of its status as a corporo-linguistic entity., NR: 645, Book ID: A Philosophy of Curating, Processed Text: despit precis delin exact mechan apparatu exposit simultan emancipatori annihil doubl valenc ultim littl differ homo gloriou bodi least term statu linguist entiti
TEXT:  This in itself is not grounds for criticism, but it does leave open the question of a properly corporeal embodied subjectivity. Is there a way to think an embodied subjectivity that is not ancillary to the spectacular, itself ancillary to the linguistic? Can this embodied subjectivity evade the prohibition of instrumentality that Agamben associates with the capture of the apparatus? Must exhibition and instrumentality forever be opposed? The following three allegories challenge this very premise, and point towards the possibility for exhibition to not be bound by such strictures., NR: 646, Book ID: A Philosophy of Curating, Processed Text: ground critic doe leav open question properli corpor subject way think subject ancillari spectacular ancillari linguist subject evad prohibit instrument associ captur apparatu must exhibit instrument forev oppos follow three allegori challeng premis point toward possibl exhibit bound strictur
TEXT:  Eros: Sensual epistemology During the drinking party of Plato’s Symposium at which each guest must eulogize Eros, Socrates performs a restaging of his tutelage by the priestess Diotima from whom he claims to have learned everything he knows about love, utilizing her maieutic style of question and answer (derived from the word maia meaning ‘midwife’), the pedagogical strategy for which he himself is renowned., NR: 647, Book ID: A Philosophy of Curating, Processed Text: ero sensual epistemolog drink parti symposium guest must eulog ero tutelag priestess claim learn everyth know love maieutic style question answer deriv word mean midwif pedagog strategi renown

TEXT:  More specifically, Eros is a love of the good, thus the lover desires to have the good in perpetuity.8 Not only does love disrupt the reductive opposition of beauty/ugliness – the desire for beauty is not ugly just as the love of the good does not make one bad – but it also indicates the structure between man and god that fills the gap between the earthly and the heavenly, welding together the universe into a single interconnected whole., NR: 649, Book ID: A Philosophy of Curating, Processed Text: specif ero love good thu lover desir good perpetu doe love disrupt reduct opposit beauti ugli desir beauti ugli love good doe make one bad also structur man god fill gap earthli heavenli weld togeth univers singl whole
TEXT: 9 Eros’ daemonic function between man and the gods is duplicated in his medial state between earth and heaven, and particular and general – the latter only accessible through the former. In perhaps the text’s most famous passage, Diotima/Socrates explains how Ideal Beauty is attained progressively, beginning with an appreciation of beautiful bodies., NR: 650, Book ID: A Philosophy of Curating, Processed Text: ero daemon function man god medial state earth heaven particular gener latter access former perhap text famou passag ideal beauti progress begin appreci beauti bodi
TEXT:  It is in a carefully guided procession through increasingly less individual experiences of beauty that one reaches its universal form: Like someone using a staircase, he should go from one to two and from two to all beautiful bodies, and from beautiful bodies to beautiful practices, and from practices to beautiful forms of learning., NR: 651, Book ID: A Philosophy of Curating, Processed Text: care process increasingli less individu experi beauti one reach univers form like someon staircas one two two beauti bodi beauti bodi beauti practic practic beauti form learn
TEXT:  From forms of learning, he should end up at that form of learning which is of nothing other than that beauty itself, so that he can complete the process of learning what beauty really is.10 While the process of accessing the immaterial form of Beauty is incrementally less dependent on the individual body, the individual body nonetheless offers the crucial first glimpse of it., NR: 652, Book ID: A Philosophy of Curating, Processed Text: form learn end form learn noth beauti complet process learn beauti realli process immateri form beauti less depend individu bodi individu bodi nonetheless offer crucial first glimps
TEXT:  Likewise, the individual beautiful body is not separated from Ideal Beauty so much as in its ideal state Beauty is no longer restricted to a corporeal manifestation. The beautiful body may thus be understood as a means to the end of immortal Beauty, which then, in a pristine autonomy, illuminates everything beautiful., NR: 653, Book ID: A Philosophy of Curating, Processed Text: likewis individu beauti bodi ideal beauti much ideal state beauti longer restrict corpor manifest beauti bodi may thu understood mean end immort beauti pristin autonomi everyth beauti
TEXT:  As Diotima/Socrates instructs, however, Eros is ‘a longing not for the beautiful itself, but for the conception and generation that the beautiful effects’. Indeed, while Ideal Beauty is the stuff of immortality, man’s share in this Beauty is always limited by his corporeal mortality and his participation in Beauty takes place as its reproduction., NR: 654, Book ID: A Philosophy of Curating, Processed Text: howev ero long beauti concept gener beauti effect inde ideal beauti stuff immort man share beauti alway limit corpor mortal particip beauti take place reproduct
TEXT:  Just as all creatures are compelled by erotic desire to achieve immortality through procreation, the erotic desire for Beauty compels humanity to ‘give birth in beauty and in mind’, expressed by Diotima/Socrates in bodily terms as pregnancy: Beauty is the goddess who, as Fate or Eileithyia, presides over childbirth., NR: 655, Book ID: A Philosophy of Curating, Processed Text: creatur erot desir achiev immort procreat erot desir beauti human give birth beauti mind express bodili term pregnanc beauti goddess fate childbirth
TEXT:  That’s why, when a pregnant creature comes close to something beautiful, it becomes gentle and joyfully relaxed, and gives birth and reproduces. But, when it comes close to something ugly, it frowns and contracts in pain; it turns away and shrivels up and does not reproduce; it holds the foetus inside and is in discomfort., NR: 656, Book ID: A Philosophy of Curating, Processed Text: pregnant creatur come close someth beauti becom gentl joy relax give birth come close someth ugli frown contract pain turn away doe reproduc hold insid discomfort
TEXT:  That’s why those who are pregnant and already swollen get so excited about beauty: the bearer of beauty enables them to gain release from the pains of childbirth.11 Again, we encounter the necessity of the corporeal within the corporeal analogy; it is the ‘bearer of beauty’ that catalyses the reproductive process, the one aspect of our mortality in which the finite partakes in the eternal., NR: 657, Book ID: A Philosophy of Curating, Processed Text: pregnant alreadi swollen get excit beauti bearer beauti gain releas pain childbirth encount necess corpor within corpor analog bearer beauti catalysi reproduct process one aspect mortal finit etern

TEXT:  How this function operates in terms of knowledge is through the process of forgetting and remembering, or anamnesis: Not only do some of the things we know increase, while some of them are lost, so that even in our knowledge we are not always the same, but the principle applies as well to every single branch of knowledge., NR: 661, Book ID: A Philosophy of Curating, Processed Text: function term knowledg process forget anamnesi thing know increas lost even knowledg alway principl well everi singl branch knowledg

TEXT:  This construction of Diotima/Socrates/Plato permits a possession of the good through the fulfilment of desire, but this is not a terminal exertion that results in ossification.

TEXT:  Platonic Eros may thus be an instrumental use, but this instrumentality is a labour of love. Plague: Affective contagion By contrast, in the modernity of Antonin Artaud, the procreative ‘freedom of life’ manifest in Platonic Eros has long since vanished, replaced by the dark true freedom of the libido, ‘which is identified with all that is dirty, abject, infamous in the process of living and of throwing oneself headlong with a natural and impure vigour, with a perpetually renewed strength, into life’., NR: 666, Book ID: A Philosophy of Curating, Processed Text: ero may thu instrument use instrument labour love plagu affect contagion contrast modern procr freedom life manifest ero ha long sinc dark true freedom libido dirti abject infam process live throw oneself headlong natur impur perpetu strength life
TEXT:  It is this invigorating quality that Artaud attributes to plague, his metaphor for an essential theatre in the 1938 collection of writings, The Theatre and Its Double.

TEXT:  A model for the theatre, plague is a primordial and authentic reality that interrupts the torpid everyday, ‘shaking off the asphyxiating inertia of matter’.13 Going to great lengths to describe plague’s physical effects in which the ‘crazed bodily fluids’ seek exit from every orifice as the body putrefies, Artaud likens this experience to a volcanic eruption homologous with the historical circumstances in which plague occurs, such as political upheavals, deaths of kings and cataclysmic events., NR: 668, Book ID: A Philosophy of Curating, Processed Text: model plagu primordi authent realiti interrupt torpid everyday shake inertia matter go great length describ plagu physic effect craze bodili fluid seek exit everi orific bodi experi volcan erupt homolog histor circumst plagu polit upheav death king cataclysm event
TEXT:  During an outbreak – the time of the plague – all social order disintegrates, a libidinal craze overcomes all and a ‘frenetic gratuitousness’ prevails.14 Dismissing any notion of contagion by contact, Artaud asserts that plague, disruptive on every front, is instead ‘the direct instrument or materialization of an intelligent force in close contact with what we call fatality’., NR: 669, Book ID: A Philosophy of Curating, Processed Text: outbreak time plagu social order libidin craze frenet gratuit notion contagion contact plagu disrupt everi front instead direct instrument materi intellig forc close contact call fatal
TEXT:  Indeed, plague bears a mysterious kinship to both destruction and sovereignty. The affliction, which Artaud characterizes as a ‘psychic entity’ rather than a virus, is a form of communication, and is in particularly close communion with the depraved and the despotic., NR: 670, Book ID: A Philosophy of Curating, Processed Text: inde plagu bear mysteri kinship destruct sovereignti afflict psychic entiti rather viru form commun particularli close communion deprav despot
TEXT:  Beyond the historical examples by which this phenomenon is demonstrated, Artaud points out that it is not merely the sovereign in name who communes with plague psychically; it is a sovereign gesture in itself to commune with the malady unscathed: No one can say why the plague strikes the coward who flees it and spares the degenerate who gratifies himself on the corpses., NR: 671, Book ID: A Philosophy of Curating, Processed Text: beyond histor exampl phenomenon point mere sovereign name commun plagu psychic sovereign gestur commun maladi unscath one say plagu strike coward spare degener corp
TEXT:  Why distance, chastity, solitude are helpless against the attacks of the scourge (. . .) From these peculiarities, these mysteries, these contradictions and these symptoms we must construct the spiritual physiognomy of a disease which progressively destroys the organism like a pain which, as it intensifies and deepens, multiplies its resources and means of access at every level of the sensibility., NR: 672, Book ID: A Philosophy of Curating, Processed Text: distanc chastiti solitud helpless attack scourg peculiar mysteri contradict symptom must construct spiritu physiognomi diseas progress organ like pain resourc mean access everi level sensibl
TEXT: 15 It is precisely the notion of a ‘spiritual physiognomy’ that defines the form of plague as a theatrical form. Artaud likens the plague victim to the actor; both are struck with the paroxysm of a spiritual force, but whereas the plague occurs in a state of ‘physical disorganization’, in the theatre this force is entirely sensual., NR: 673, Book ID: A Philosophy of Curating, Processed Text: precis notion spiritu physiognomi form plagu theatric form plagu victim actor struck paroxysm spiritu forc wherea plagu state physic disorgan forc entir sensual

TEXT:  The contagion of plague is, in fact, by example. Artaud declares, ‘If the essential theatre is like the plague, it is not because it is contagious, but because like the plague it is the revelation, the bringing forth, the exteriorization of a depth of latent cruelty by means of which all the perverse possibilities of the mind, whether of an individual or a people, are localized., NR: 676, Book ID: A Philosophy of Curating, Processed Text: contagion plagu fact exampl essenti like plagu contagi like plagu revel forth exterior depth latent cruelti mean pervers possibl mind whether individu peopl

TEXT: ’19 Contrary to Agamben’s post-Debordian understanding, however, Artaud’s spectacle is not a spectral absence of signification or a disembodied glorious soma as image, but, rather, a total and collective embodied sensual experience, a corporo-spectacular subjectivity., NR: 679, Book ID: A Philosophy of Curating, Processed Text: contrari post understand howev spectacl spectral absenc signif gloriou soma imag rather total collect sensual experi spectacular subject
TEXT:  Though one may discern a certain empowerment in this taking hold of the spectacle, Artaud’s philosophy is quite distinct from Agamben’s formula of inoperativity. The spectacular plague/theatre populates rather than empties gestures: The plague takes images that are dormant, a latent disorder, and suddenly extends them into the most extreme gestures; the theatre also takes gestures and pushes them as far as they will go: like the plague it reforges the chain between what is and what is not, between the virtuality of the possible and what already exists in materialized nature., NR: 680, Book ID: A Philosophy of Curating, Processed Text: though one may discern certain empower take hold spectacl philosophi quit distinct formula spectacular plagu rather empti gestur plagu take imag dormant latent disord suddenli extrem gestur also take gestur push far like plagu chain virtual possibl alreadi natur
TEXT:  It recovers the notion of symbols and archetypes which act like silent blows, rests, leaps of the heart, summons of the lymph, inflammatory images thrust into our abruptly wakened heads.20 Unlike Agamben’s typological gestures of the commedia dell’arte, ‘subtracted from the powers of myth and destiny’ in which ‘the mask insinuates itself between text and execution’, in Artaud’s theatre, the masks fall away to reveal ‘the lie, the slackness, baseness, and hypocrisy of our world’., NR: 681, Book ID: A Philosophy of Curating, Processed Text: notion symbol archetyp act like silent blow rest leap heart summon lymph inflammatori imag thrust abruptli head unlik typolog gestur dell power myth destini mask text execut mask fall away reveal lie slack base hypocrisi world

TEXT:  Condillac advances a first philosophy of sensuality through the hypothesis of a statue to which each of the senses are added, one by one, beginning with scent, demonstrating that all aspects of cognitive capacity, including pleasure and pain, memory, comparison, judgement, imagination, desire and will can all be derived from the most primitive of the five senses., NR: 684, Book ID: A Philosophy of Curating, Processed Text: advanc first philosophi sensual hypothesi statu ad one one begin scent aspect cognit capac pleasur pain memori comparison imagin desir deriv primit five
TEXT:  While olfaction may be the ground for all cognitive function, it does not disclose any knowledge of being in extension. This is the very first premise of the Treatise, followed by the logical consequence of the unity between the sensing statue and the fragrance that it smells: ‘If we give the statue a rose to smell, to us it is a statue smelling a rose, to itself it is smell of rose., NR: 685, Book ID: A Philosophy of Curating, Processed Text: olfact may ground cognit function doe disclos knowledg extens first premis treatis logic consequ uniti statu fragranc smell give statu rose smell statu smell rose smell rose
TEXT:  (. . .) It cannot be anything else, since it is only susceptible to sensations.’23 In this critical inquiry into the nature of human consciousness, cognition, therefore, is derived from sense, irrespective of knowledge of objects, and this bare cognition comprises a subjectivity immanent to its stimulus, a being-sense of olfaction., NR: 686, Book ID: A Philosophy of Curating, Processed Text: cannot anyth els sinc suscept sensat critic inquiri natur human conscious cognit therefor deriv sens irrespect knowledg object bare cognit subject imman stimulu sens olfact

TEXT:  Memory is thus a sequence of ideas that form a chain, a ‘connection which furnishes the means of passing from one idea to another, and of recalling the most distant’.27 This chain, though progressive, is nonetheless fluid thanks to the disruptive function of the imagination that reorders the ideas constructed from the comparisons made from the accumulation of experience into new sequences., NR: 696, Book ID: A Philosophy of Curating, Processed Text: memori thu sequenc idea form chain connect mean pass one idea anoth distant chain though progress nonetheless fluid thank disrupt function imagin reorder idea comparison made accumul experi new sequenc

TEXT:  Some curators had doctorates in art history. Some artists had MFAs. The MA in curating signalled a turning tide, not just in the field of curating, but in the ways that both curators and artists were beginning to understand the relationships between research, art-making and exhibition-making and how these fell outside or in between Art History’s specialist knowledge and the media-specific specialization of Fine Art., NR: 738, Book ID: A Philosophy of Curating, Processed Text: curat doctor art histori artist turn tide field way curat artist begin understand relationship research art make exhibit make fell outsid art histori specialist knowledg medium specif special fine art

Is it a field or subject? How does it claim certain conventions around curating, while also claiming that one operates differently through the curatorial? Are curators who are attentive or ‘interested’ in ‘the curatorial’ different to curators who aren’t? Are they better curators? As I wonder how we got here, of course, I am really asking: Is this where we want to be?

TEXT:  Crossing over The English edition of The Order of Things begins with Foucault asking, by way of hypothesis, what if empirical knowledge, with all of the speculations, distortions, old beliefs and practices, errors, naive notions, as well as genuine discoveries, obeyed ‘the laws of a certain code of knowledge?’3 Taking this premise as a basis for thinking about curatorial knowledge, that is, knowledge produced through an engagement with the curatorial, how might we account for all of the discursive layers in an exhibition that fall outside the intentions and designs set forth in word and deed by the curator? The point is not to inventory these layers as traceable ‘events’ within the curatorial, but rather to consider how we arrive at different, potentially radical articulations of knowledge (what Foucault might call a system of ‘non-formal knowledge’) that are not identifiable through, let alone attributable to the act of curating., NR: 753, Book ID: A Philosophy of Curating, Processed Text: cross edit order thing begin way hypothesi empir knowledg specul distort old belief practic error naiv notion well genuin discoveri law certain code knowledg take premis basi think curatori knowledg knowledg produc engag curatori might account discurs layer exhibit fall outsid intent design set forth word deed curat point inventori layer traceabl event within curatori rather consid arriv differ potenti radic articul knowledg might call system non formal knowledg identifi let alon attribut act
TEXT:  My immediate concern is to disengage the curatorial from the professional work of the curator. That is, to dissociate the curatorial from curating. My reasons are partly tactical: First, it frees us from continually returning to discussions that define the curatorial through the systems and structures of curating as they exist (what might be considered ‘curatorial conditions’) and second, it moves the discussion away from ‘curatorial work’ – the methodologies, administrations, and activities enacted within the realm (professional, institutional, intellectual) of the curator – towards ways of producing that do not involve (or include) a curator., NR: 754, Book ID: A Philosophy of Curating, Processed Text: immedi concern disengag curatori profession work curat dissoci curatori reason partli tactic first free continu discuss defin curatori system structur exist might consid curatori condit second move discuss away curatori work methodolog administr activ within realm profession institut intellectu curat toward way involv includ curat
TEXT:  Hence, the shift is also a deflection. It purposefully diverts from current preoccupations about what curating is and whose work the curatorial refers to, so that we may consider the realm of ‘the curatorial’ as something other than ordering codes and modes of being embroiled in curating., NR: 755, Book ID: A Philosophy of Curating, Processed Text: henc shift also deflect purpos current preoccup whose work curatori may consid realm curatori someth code mode

TEXT:  Let us say, for now, contiguity exists, and that is all. The other To begin, to ‘rise up’, often paradoxically implies an ending – a destination. In this paradox, because of it, we sometimes set up problems, things to address or achieve that help us ‘see’ where we are going – what Derrida might call the hegemony of a problematic – the disguised ‘re-centrings’ that reassure us that we are on the right path., NR: 757, Book ID: A Philosophy of Curating, Processed Text: let say contigu begin rise often paradox end destin paradox sometim set problem thing address achiev help see go might call hegemoni problemat disguis reassur right path
TEXT: 4 So often, when we talk about the curatorial, we limit our discussion to the staging of exhibitions. What does it mean to have this end in mind? This limit or destination? Is the narrative of the curatorial bound to the end point of the exhibition? What is the object of the curatorial? Barthes identifies a point in Jacob’s struggle with the angel when the primary goal or destiny of the story – to reach the safety of the river’s other side – appears both dependent upon and frustrated by the lengthy diversion of a fight, where strangely, it is unclear who Jacob’s ‘opponent’ is – God? Man? A stranger?

TEXT:  And most importantly, this encounter is part of the story. Its ambiguity is the source of centuries of scholarly study.

TEXT:  With this collective gaze, the scene expands and a narrative comes into play.

TEXT:  A scene expands – and on the level of how we know, our engagement with Las Meninas deepens. The visual construction of the painting is such that, even without access to the historical codes of representation that determine Las Meninas as a court painting, any viewer can navigate its sightlines and reason that the figures reflected in the back of the room are the subjects of the large canvas’ other side., NR: 765, Book ID: A Philosophy of Curating, Processed Text: scene level know engag la visual construct paint even without access histor code represent determin la court paint viewer navig reason figur reflect back room subject larg canva side
TEXT:  A conscious artifice of veilings and unveilings leads to a subject outside the frame. For Foucault, this artifice constitutes a sudden change in the way painting, as a discipline, previously organized the relationships between artwork and viewer, artist and subject., NR: 766, Book ID: A Philosophy of Curating, Processed Text: consciou artific veil unveil lead subject outsid frame artific sudden chang way paint disciplin previous organ relationship viewer artist subject
TEXT:  The artifice that leads us to a subject simultaneously displaces all subjects. The artist directs his gaze to a spot outside the canvas, and remarkably, our eyes meet.

TEXT:  The king’s authority over representation, over all ‘subjects’, disperses into multiple perspectives occupied by countless others. Every gaze outward multiplies in return, and yet, ‘No gaze is stable, or rather, in the neutral furrow of the gaze piercing at a right angle through the canvas, subject and object, the spectator and the model, reverse their roles to infinity., NR: 768, Book ID: A Philosophy of Curating, Processed Text: king author represent subject multipl perspect countless everi gaze outward return yet gaze stabl rather neutral furrow gaze pierc right angl canva subject object spectat model revers role infin
TEXT: ’5 As we consider the large canvas before us, not the one that exists materially, but the one represented, we enter the instability of our role as ‘viewers’.

TEXT: 6 Where language enters to ‘explain’ the visual, the visual ‘cancels out’ what is said. Foucault views this difficulty as a ‘starting point for speech’. The theoretical and the material produce through dependencies, ‘in an infinite relation’, that which traverses inside and outside, the peripheral and the frontal, what is seen and what remains out-of-sight., NR: 774, Book ID: A Philosophy of Curating, Processed Text: languag explain visual visual cancel said view difficulti start point speech theoret materi produc depend infinit relat travers insid outsid peripher frontal seen remain sight
TEXT:  It is not that words are insufficient or inadequate in the face of images. It is that our desire for a work of art to ‘say’ something locates that ‘something’ within the image. As soon as we name that something, we change it – that is to say, we make a decision to change, to mutate what is inside the frame., NR: 775, Book ID: A Philosophy of Curating, Processed Text: word insuffici inadequ face imag desir work art say someth someth within imag soon name someth chang say make decis chang mutat insid frame
TEXT:  The setting down Barthes concludes ‘The Struggle with the Angel’ like this: ‘The problem, the problem at least posed for me, is exactly to manage not to reduce the Text to a signified, whatever it may be (historical, economic, folkloristic or kerygmatic), but to hold its signifiance fully open., NR: 776, Book ID: A Philosophy of Curating, Processed Text: set struggl angel like problem problem least exactli manag reduc text whatev may histor econom folklorist kerygmat hold fulli open
TEXT: ’7 In linguistics, signifiance is the emergence of meaning in the receiver. For Barthes (through Kristeva), signifiance holds a level of creative, transgressive meaning. How to keep the signifiance of the curatorial open at the very moment when we arrive at its meaning? Returning to the idea of the curatorial as a simple operator for a beginning, perhaps we can think of the endpoint of the exhibition as a mere ‘setting down’., NR: 777, Book ID: A Philosophy of Curating, Processed Text: linguist emerg mean receiv hold level creativ transgress mean keep curatori open moment arriv mean idea curatori simpl oper begin perhap think exhibit mere set
TEXT:  It is a moment where one thing is let go and in letting go, it allows others to take it up. Hannah Arendt, who wrote eloquently about such activities that orient us towards a future, developed a concept of ‘action’ that consists of a similar setting down and letting go., NR: 778, Book ID: A Philosophy of Curating, Processed Text: moment one thing let take wrote eloqu activ orient toward futur concept action similar set
TEXT:  Action is when an individual puts something out into the world through speech or deed, and in doing so, cannot predict or determine how it will evolve.

TEXT:  As the curatorial enters a lexicon of institutional practice, its meanings arise from beyond the work of curating that carries out a plan or produces an end product, beyond the person who curates and the potential methodologies and rethought institutional practices that bind the curatorial to individual ‘acts’ of curating., NR: 781, Book ID: A Philosophy of Curating, Processed Text: curatori lexicon institut practic mean aris beyond work carri plan produc end product beyond person curat potenti methodolog institut practic bind curatori individu act
TEXT:  To think about radical formations of knowledge that occur through the curatorial is to undo its functional, structural relationship to curating – whether as a potential methodology or as a mode of operating – so that we might begin to address the curatorial as a political engagement, as it connects to knowledge production in ways that are neither good nor bad, but are unpredictable and difficult to manage., NR: 782, Book ID: A Philosophy of Curating, Processed Text: think radic format knowledg occur curatori undo function structur relationship whether potenti methodolog mode oper might begin address curatori polit engag knowledg product way neither good bad unpredict difficult manag
TEXT:  In the language of the unconscious, what Barthes calls ‘metonymic logic’, the curatorial hides away in the background as we foreground all of the ideas and theories that appear to be moving us towards self-awareness and deeper understandings, when really, really our present study is a dissemination, not a truth., NR: 783, Book ID: A Philosophy of Curating, Processed Text: languag unconsci call metonym logic curatori hide away background foreground idea theori appear move toward self awar understand realli realli present studi dissemin truth

TEXT: 12 Three Short Takes on the Curatorial Doreen Mende Blinding The curatorial takes place in the middle of a contradictory web of relations. How is one to think these contradictions while being implicated in them? A point of entry is perhaps the blind spot: It is a point on our retina where the optical nerve prevents the act of seeing., NR: 788, Book ID: A Philosophy of Curating, Processed Text: three short take curatori blind curatori take place middl contradictori web relat one think contradict point entri perhap blind spot point retina optic nerv act see
TEXT:  This physiological condition makes us all equal (everyone has a blind spot) and yet it also distinguishes us from each other (no two blind spots can be identical). The blind spot fractures the supposed unity of our subjectivities (suddenly, not everything is visible) and yet it activates our subjectivities through (visual) relations., NR: 789, Book ID: A Philosophy of Curating, Processed Text: physiolog condit make equal everyon ha blind spot yet also two blind spot ident blind spot fractur suppos uniti subject suddenli everyth visibl yet subject visual relat
TEXT:  This does not mean that the pairings ‘you’ and ‘me’, ‘now’ and ‘then’, or ‘here’ and ‘elsewhere’ cease to exist. This only means that the blind spot acts as an ‘in-between’ – an ‘and’ – that disturbs synchronous spatiality and temporality (not everything is in one place and time)., NR: 790, Book ID: A Philosophy of Curating, Processed Text: doe mean elsewher ceas exist mean blind spot act synchron spatial tempor everyth one place time
TEXT:  This blind spot is what throws us into the arena of the curatorial, this a-synchronous world full of ambivalences. While curating helps us to programme located public events, the blinding effect of the blind spot makes us enter a place (the curatorial) where we lose control and orientation because, as Jean-Luc Godard says, ., NR: 791, Book ID: A Philosophy of Curating, Processed Text: blind spot throw arena curatori synchron world full ambival help public event blind effect blind spot make enter place curatori lose control orient jean say

TEXT:  Not a show, but a struggle.1 The blinding effect of the blind spot therefore goes against the activity of curating because it is a way of fracturing what is exhibited and this without breaking or removing any object on show., NR: 793, Book ID: A Philosophy of Curating, Processed Text: show struggl blind effect blind spot therefor go activ way without break remov object show
TEXT:  This blinding effect is like a missing word, the black strip between the frames of a film, the white space between the letters in a text, the silence between the sounds of words or the immeasurable space that separates an action and the manifestation of that action., NR: 794, Book ID: A Philosophy of Curating, Processed Text: blind effect like miss word black strip frame film white space letter text silenc sound word immeasur space separ action manifest action
TEXT:  This blinding ‘moment’ cannot be reified, replaced, or represented because, in the moment of exposure, it escapes the creative action of exposing. It is a moment in which ‘exhibiting’ is not there yet, but is in the process of being constituted., NR: 795, Book ID: A Philosophy of Curating, Processed Text: blind moment cannot moment exposur escap creativ action moment yet process
TEXT:  In other words, this blinding ‘moment’ is the one that detects and disturbs the conditions in which ‘meaning’ emerges. Or to put it differently: While the blind spot is a point of entry into a contradictory set of relations, the blinding ‘moment’ is the danger that shatters the jurisdiction of meaning., NR: 796, Book ID: A Philosophy of Curating, Processed Text: word blind moment one condit mean put differ blind spot point entri contradictori set relat blind moment danger jurisdict mean
TEXT:  Inhibiting For quite a few years now, I have been working with the term ‘inhibiting’. This term functions neither as a model nor as a theme. I consider it a condition (or an enabling element) to rethink exhibiting., NR: 797, Book ID: A Philosophy of Curating, Processed Text: quit year work term term function neither model theme consid condit element rethink
TEXT:  Its use is crucial because, for me, it helps to question the paradigm in Western culture of always shedding light on what is discovered, analysed and displayed. In other words, ‘inhibiting’ helps to question the predominance of light in exhibition practice., NR: 798, Book ID: A Philosophy of Curating, Processed Text: use crucial help question paradigm western cultur alway shed light discov display word help question predomin light exhibit practic
TEXT:  This questioning has a political dimension because ‘inhibiting’ helps to open up the relation between heterogeneous forms of practice and theoretical thinking and to unfold the possibilities of cultural differences., NR: 799, Book ID: A Philosophy of Curating, Processed Text: ha polit dimens help open relat heterogen form practic theoret think unfold possibl cultur differ
TEXT:  This does not pitch exhibiting against inhibiting; the two neither fight nor compete against each other; and they do not stand for their representational counterpart. Exhibiting and ‘inhibiting’ exist through each other as a set of relays with different points of departure: In contrast to exhibiting, ‘inhibiting’ starts from a non-common ground, it has neither a common language nor a predetermined knowledge., NR: 800, Book ID: A Philosophy of Curating, Processed Text: doe pitch two neither fight compet stand counterpart exist set relay differ point departur contrast start non common ground ha neither common languag knowledg
TEXT:  It also has no history, properly speaking.

TEXT:  In this way, and in contrast to institutional critique (of the 1970s, for example) or the conceptual practice of analysis of the institution (in the 1990s, for example), this approach to exhibiting via ‘inhibiting’ sabotages all those knowledges that give the impression of having been secured., NR: 803, Book ID: A Philosophy of Curating, Processed Text: way contrast institut critiqu exampl conceptu practic analysi institut exampl approach via sabotag knowledg give impress
TEXT:  It liberates us from the Western imperative to always shed light on things and it confronts us with the limits of our thinking, thus, with our own foreignness.

TEXT:  As such, any interpretation of the work can only fail because it is effectively a symptom of the missing origin. Sigmund Freud defined a symptom as the success of the process of repression.

TEXT:  In a way, a symptom is a bit like a concise description of a contemporary art exhibition, especially in the context of its economy.

TEXT:  The symptom has a life: that of always reinventing the unexplainable origin that led it to become an event.

TEXT:  However, instead of adopting the one-on-one model put forward by the discipline of psychoanalysis, the curatorial chooses a different model.

TEXT:  Instead, the symptom takes place when there is a transfer of a body of thought – into the future and into an unfamiliar space. The symptom happens through a practice of displacement.

TEXT:  . . the border is no longer the border, images are coming and going through customs, the link between the political and the local, the topolitical, is as it were dislocated.2 The aim of the curatorial then is not to cure a symptom (finding the origin of what has been exposed, for example), but to highlight the topolitical, this shift between origin and arrival or narrative to come., NR: 810, Book ID: A Philosophy of Curating, Processed Text: border longer border imag come go custom link polit local disloc aim curatori cure symptom find origin ha expos exampl highlight shift origin arriv narr come

TEXT:  What is investigated here, what is put on trial here is judgement.

TEXT:  These are all based on curating as a structure of judgement. And authority and judgement, Madam Chairwoman and honoured committee members, are the core operations of yours here, as well.

TEXT:  This term is Betrayal. Curating can be seen as a structure of judgement because it is overall a practice of affirmation; it affirms above all the authority of the curator. With Betrayal, processes and paradigms of judgement are re-evaluated and debated., NR: 857, Book ID: A Philosophy of Curating, Processed Text: term betray seen structur overal practic affirm author curat betray process paradigm
TEXT:  Betrayal is embedded within the structure of judgement. Betrayal troubles the affirmative model of curating, in which curators show things based on their authority and judgement.

With such a suspension, the exhibition conceptualizes singularities., NR: 863, Book ID: A Philosophy of Curating, Processed Text: let give exampl clearli defin space time exhibit exhibit narrow sens suspend durat suspens exhibit singular
TEXT:  It is a process through which a conceptual framework arises from specific instances. While there is the relative quality of the exhibition as narrative (I see one thing in this while you see another thing in it), there is also the relational nature of the event of the exhibition by which there are scripted and unscripted relations between the various authors of a piece, the worlds, spaces and contexts it connects to, the curated syntax and all that which the viewers bring forth., NR: 864, Book ID: A Philosophy of Curating, Processed Text: process conceptu framework specif instanc rel qualiti exhibit narr see one thing see anoth thing also relat natur event exhibit relat variou author piec world space context syntax viewer bring forth

TEXT:  This, in no way, should be seen as an encouragement to understand Betrayal as the act of pretending.

TEXT:  With Betrayal, the curatorial enacts antagonisms scripted into the exhibition and goes beyond them to propose new potentialities.

TEXT:  Yet politics has come to mean the opposite of daily life for the many. Especially under so-called democratic regimes, politics has become a narrow field of meaning, separate from life.

TEXT:  Therefore, many political proposals that aim at dealing directly with politics find themselves to be articulated outside politics, seeking refuge elsewhere.

TEXT:  As such, the curatorial carries a direct political potential. From nation-building to empowering communities or whitewashing financial crimes, curators operate on many different spheres.

TEXT:  But the curatorial does so not so much as potential, but more as an actualization of potentialities, that is, as an opening up of potentials.

TEXT:  The interesting thing here though, Madame Chairwoman, is that they all accepted the fact that it did something – it resonated with a symbolic violence.

TEXT:  This conspiracy calls forth a complicit love, a love on the side of conspiracy and against the plot, against the police who are called into being by the plot. Complicit love, as Paolo Friere might say, is a love ‘on the side’ that knows which side it is on, a love for those who conspire, a love that calls forth the police for being against the plot, a love against the police and in the conspiracy., NR: 915, Book ID: A Philosophy of Curating, Processed Text: conspiraci call forth love love side conspiraci plot polic plot love paolo might say love side know side love conspir love call forth polic plot love polic conspiraci

TEXT:  The curator, who is a caretaker, creates a space for making art, without knowing what art will be made. The caretaker makes something possible, makes more happen, in the space of art-making, through the care of that space, the care with which she fills that space, the care with which she quietly inhabits that space without owning it, lives in it without being at home in it, cultivates it without plotting what it produces., NR: 993, Book ID: A Philosophy of Curating, Processed Text: curat caretak space make art without know art made caretak make someth possibl make happen space art make care space care fill space care quietli space without life without home without plot produc

TEXT:  The caretaker makes a safe space for the complicity already at work in art and allows those who make art together to stay in complicity, to remain dangerous to themselves and each other. The curator who is the accomplice provides the care that allows others to stay in the complicity of making art together, as a form of ongoing conspiracy, rather than seeking the safety of being viewers and artists, of plotting art pieces and their display., NR: 997, Book ID: A Philosophy of Curating, Processed Text: caretak make safe space complic alreadi work art make art togeth stay complic remain danger curat accomplic care stay complic make art togeth form ongo conspiraci rather seek safeti viewer artist plot art piec display

TEXT:  For this right to insist on the meaninglessness of silence after a question is asked operates as a ban on interpretation.

TEXT:  The question clearly produces something – even if that something is nothing we can pin down. The fields of curating and education are filled with questions. It is nearly a cliché by now to state that one is more interested in posing questions, than in coming up with answers; to state that an exhibition acts as a proposition, not a solution; or that education aims to help students formulate their own questions, and not just fill their heads with inherited answers., NR: 1013, Book ID: A Philosophy of Curating, Processed Text: question clearli produc someth even someth noth pin field educ fill question nearli clich state one interest pose question come answer state exhibit act proposit solut educ aim help student formul question fill head answer

TEXT:  Likewise, in state politics and constitutional law, answers in the form of election polls or referendum results annul the question. By contrast, in philosophy, the claim is often made that questioning operates as a procedure that builds a way not only to a solution that would remove the question, but also to an altered and perhaps critical relationship to the thing questioned., NR: 1015, Book ID: A Philosophy of Curating, Processed Text: likewis state polit constitut law answer form elect poll referendum result annul question contrast philosophi claim often made procedur build way solut would remov question also perhap critic relationship thing

TEXT:  If we take Adorno’s characterization of the question away from the discrete field of philosophy, and into the broader critical discourses that surround practices of art eduction and of curating, how do questions organize the relationships between experience and knowledge there? And can the experiences that shape these questions be understood simply as individual or as inherently social?

TEXT: 3 Questions are allocated and privatized to the research project of the proper name, coming into public existence as unique positions to be agreed with, disagreed with, modified and so on. For Colectivo Situaciones, one of the results of this tendency is that ‘we are faced with a paradox today, where at the very moment in which political discourses proliferate, we assist in a progressive de-politicization of the social sphere and of language., NR: 1027, Book ID: A Philosophy of Curating, Processed Text: question research project proper name come public exist uniqu posit agre disagre one result tendenc face paradox today moment polit discours prolifer assist progress social sphere languag

TEXT:  Maurizio Lazzarato, among others, argues that contemporary forms of neoliberal governance and regimes of cognitive capital have made the terrain of micropolitics ever more important to tackle. Taking the example of the schizophrenia produced in the subject through contemporary forms of labour and the mobilization of ‘human capital’, Lazzarato argues that the contemporary worker sells their labour (and so is exploited like everyone who is bound to a wage relation), but simultaneously becomes a shareholder in the thing that exploits them., NR: 1035, Book ID: A Philosophy of Curating, Processed Text: among contemporari form govern regim cognit capit made terrain ever import tackl take exampl schizophrenia produc subject contemporari form labour mobil human capit contemporari worker sell labour like everyon bound wage relat simultan becom sharehold thing exploit

Last year, during a round of mandated bureaucratic student feedback, I noticed lots of specific commentary on the academic courses students have taken (‘could have had more copies of the books in the library’, ‘would have liked to read more Kant’ and so on), but that apart from the usual complaints about the blocked studio sink, nothing much is ever questioned about studio practice teaching., NR: 1040, Book ID: A Philosophy of Curating, Processed Text: equivoc fascin least half everi year fight inertia depress last year round bureaucrat student feedback lot specif commentari academ cours student taken could copi book librari would read apart usual complaint block studio sink noth much ever studio practic teach

The fantastic non-passive art student, filled with desire, intiative and curiosity is the same student who internalizes that absolute responsibility, the one that is depressed and inert?

TEXT:  The term can encompass two words in English: first, ‘experience’ in the sense of an accumulation of knowledges; and second, ‘experiment’ understood as practice.11 Bringing together knowledge/experience and experimentation in this way aims to halt the severing of knowledge as theme and insist on a much more specific set of connections and relays between knowledge and practice., NR: 1049, Book ID: A Philosophy of Curating, Processed Text: term encompass two word first experi sens accumul knowledg second experi understood practic togeth knowledg experi experiment way aim halt knowledg theme insist much specif set connect relay knowledg practic

TEXT:  Crucially, this experiencia would also incite the constituent dimension of the question as exposed at the start of this essay. The notion of ‘constituent power’ to which this constituent dimension of the question refers is often associated with the Latin root of the word power as potencia, the dynamic, constituting dimension of power, the power, force or strength to do something, as opposed to poder, the more static dimension of constituted power at work in dominant systems of political representation and government., NR: 1051, Book ID: A Philosophy of Curating, Processed Text: crucial would also incit constitu dimens question expos start essay notion constitu power constitu dimens question often associ root word power dynam dimens power power forc strength someth oppos static dimens power work domin system polit represent govern
TEXT:  The question as constituent force would become vulnerable to the unknown and to the complexity of contingent collective processes, subjects, situations and events. Far from the privatized individuated research project where questions often shore up and defend what has already been made, decided and agreed upon, the constituent question would experiment openly in the play of institutional and political forces that seek to manage, parse and block its power., NR: 1052, Book ID: A Philosophy of Curating, Processed Text: question constitu forc would becom vulner unknown complex conting collect process subject situat event far research project question often shore defend ha alreadi made decid agre upon constitu question would experi openli play institut polit forc seek manag pars block power
TEXT:  A constituent question about the relationship between art and education under conditions of intense neoliberal transformation would, for example, produce experiments and analyses in the midst of the messy sites of contestation in the university (occupations, open meetings and so on), rather than reiterate itself at yet another panel discussion on art and education in a neoliberal cultural institution charging £10 a seat., NR: 1053, Book ID: A Philosophy of Curating, Processed Text: constitu question relationship art educ condit intens transform would exampl produc experi analysi midst messi site contest univers occup open meet rather reiter yet anoth panel discuss art educ cultur institut charg seat

TEXT:  In the last few years, curatorial projects have increasingly been seen as discursive spaces with a potential to intervene in existing power relations. How can philosophical concepts support these practices?

TEXT:  Under the title ‘More on Power/Knowledge’,1 the postcolonial theorist Gayatri Spivak reads Foucault with Derrida and makes us understand that savoir-pouvoir – the two French words for power and knowledge – are not only powerful substantives, but also verbs., NR: 1068, Book ID: A Philosophy of Curating, Processed Text: titl power knowledg postcoloni theorist gayatri read make understand two word power knowledg power substant also verb
TEXT:  Savoir means ‘knowing how to do something’ and pouvoir, as a verb, means ‘being able to’. As in the case of savoir-vivre, Spivak connects the two words, and it is exactly in this sense that she rereads Foucault’s savoir-pouvoir as ‘being able to do something’., NR: 1069, Book ID: A Philosophy of Curating, Processed Text: mean know someth verb mean abl case two word exactli sens abl someth
TEXT:  Taking this into account opens for a perspective on curatorial agency: While in reflexive museology the ‘exhibitionary complex’ has been theorized along the lines of power and knowledge, I suggest, with Spivak, to think curating as a theoretical practice and practical theory that is about being able to do and to change something., NR: 1070, Book ID: A Philosophy of Curating, Processed Text: take account open perspect curatori agenc reflex museolog complex ha along line power knowledg suggest think theoret practic practic theori abl chang someth
TEXT:  More concretely: Since the 1960s, representation has been confronted with increasing scepticism in the field of art (especially in institutional critique), in theory (especially in cultural studies, postcolonial and post-structuralist theories) and in activism (especially in the new post-identitarian social movements)., NR: 1071, Book ID: A Philosophy of Curating, Processed Text: concret sinc represent ha increas field art especi institut critiqu theori especi cultur studi postcoloni post structuralist theori activ especi new post social movement

TEXT:  Let’s think for example of all the artistic strategies of processualization, dematerialization and institutional critique, all of which are opposed to the representational mode.

TEXT:  And it is exactly at this moment that Spivak’s rereading becomes relevant: If we think curating beyond representation as ‘being able to do something’, then it involves processes that produce themselves – so it is no longer about exhibitions as sites for setting up valuable objects and representing objective values, but rather about spaces for curatorial action in which unexpected encounters and discourses become possible, in which taking a stand (as unplannable as this may be) seems more important than, say, precise hanging plans., NR: 1075, Book ID: A Philosophy of Curating, Processed Text: exactli moment becom relev think beyond represent abl someth process produc longer exhibit site set valuabl object object valu rather space curatori action unexpect encount discours becom possibl take stand may import say precis hang plan
TEXT:  Gerald Raunig describes this potential to act at the very heart of the nexus of power and knowledge as ‘instituant practices’. He writes: ‘What is needed, therefore, are practices that conduct radical social criticism, yet which do not fancy themselves in an imagined distance to institutions; at the same time, practices that are self-critical and yet do not cling to their own involvement, their complicity, their imprisoned existence in the art field, their fixation on institutions and the institution, their own being-institution., NR: 1076, Book ID: A Philosophy of Curating, Processed Text: potenti act heart nexu power knowledg practic therefor practic conduct radic social critic yet fanci distanc institut time practic self critic yet cling involv complic exist art field fixat institut institut institut
TEXT: ’2 From this perspective, curating becomes a political and intellectual practice or, as Oliver Marchart referring to Antonio Gramsci puts it, an organic intellectual task of organizing.3 As such, it is post-representational and post-dramatic: it is no longer about showing or representing something, but about ensuring that something can happen., NR: 1077, Book ID: A Philosophy of Curating, Processed Text: perspect becom polit intellectu practic put organ intellectu task post post dramat longer show someth someth happen
TEXT: 4 Moreover, following James Clifford and Mary Louise Pratt, exhibitions can be understood as shared social spaces where different agents come together and act. This concept of the contact zone is based on contingency and processuality: It is a space of negotiation in which the meaning of words and things is not fixed but always open for discussion., NR: 1078, Book ID: A Philosophy of Curating, Processed Text: moreov follow mari exhibit understood social space differ agent come togeth act concept contact zone base conting space negoti mean word thing fix alway open discuss
TEXT:  Representation is replaced by process: Rather than dealing with objective values and valuable objects curating entails agency, unexpected encounters and discursive examinations.

TEXT:  Thus, as Clifford points out, the aim should not be a ‘give-and-take that could lead to a final meeting of minds, a coming together that would erase the discrepancies, the ongoing power imbalances of contact relations’., NR: 1080, Book ID: A Philosophy of Curating, Processed Text: thu point aim give take could lead final meet mind come togeth would eras discrep ongo power imbal contact relat
TEXT: 5 Accordingly, post-representational curating creates spaces for negotiation, openly addressing contradictions within seemingly symmetrical relations. This also may involve conflict as Clifford speaks of the contact zone as a conflict zone., NR: 1081, Book ID: A Philosophy of Curating, Processed Text: accordingli post space negoti openli contradict within seemingli symmetr relat also may involv conflict contact zone conflict zone
TEXT:  Both references show that critical curating as agency does not only become processual but is potentially conflictual.

TEXT: 6 So it would be definitely easy to think curating as able to create political situations. But how can curating then become a place in which something can happen?

TEXT:  For Jacques Derrida, the impossible is the condition of possibility of the possible. In the context of post-representative curating, this could suggest that there is a dimension of agency in its very uncontrollability., NR: 1084, Book ID: A Philosophy of Curating, Processed Text: imposs condit possibl possibl context post repres could suggest dimens agenc
TEXT:  Because when there is only space for the necessary, change is impossible. Thus Derrida integrates the ‘perhaps’ in his philosophical discourse: I will not say that this thought of the impossible possible, this other thinking of the possible is a thinking of necessity but rather, as I have also tried to demonstrate elsewhere, a thinking of the ‘perhaps’ that Nietzsche speaks of and that philosophy has always tried to subjugate., NR: 1085, Book ID: A Philosophy of Curating, Processed Text: space necessari chang imposs thu perhap philosoph discours say thought imposs possibl think possibl think necess rather also tri demonstr elsewher think perhap philosophi ha alway tri subjug
TEXT:  There is no future and no relation to the coming of the event without experience of the ‘perhaps’.7 A question mark within A question mark held up on a placard in a demonstration in Buenos Aires in 2004 marks contradictions in a double sense., NR: 1086, Book ID: A Philosophy of Curating, Processed Text: futur relat come event without experi perhap question mark within question mark placard demonstr air mark contradict doubl sens
TEXT:  As an act of disobedience expressing solidarity and as an urban-social performance the work transforms the side we take into a reflexive position. The question mark may be added to the demands of the demonstration and makes it incomplete and negotiable (the same effect is created by adding the name of the artists’ group, etc., NR: 1087, Book ID: A Philosophy of Curating, Processed Text: act disobedi solidar urban social perform work side take reflex posit question mark may ad demand demonstr make incomplet negoti effect name artist group

TEXT:  Let’s call this, referring to Spivak’s reading of Foucault, a position of critical agency.

TEXT:  The necessity of taking a stance politically and the attendant impossibility of knowing whether we are intellectually on the right side has a way of producing a mode of impossibility with a qualifying ‘perhaps’, a temporal suspension that we have to assume, not as something arbitrary but as a constitutive component of the very act of making a decision., NR: 1092, Book ID: A Philosophy of Curating, Processed Text: necess take stanc polit attend imposs know whether intellectu right side ha way mode imposs perhap tempor suspens assum someth arbitrari constitut compon act make decis

TEXT:  E. Schleiermacher and Georg Simmel. Despite writing almost a century apart, the two authors conceived sociability (Geselligkeit) in a surprisingly similar way. Sociability allowed them both to address a modality of being with others that could be seen as an alternative to the limited relations afforded by domestic and professional life, two spheres that they found socially unsatisfactory, since they allowed interactions only with limited numbers of people, burdened by sets of predetermined roles., NR: 1114, Book ID: A Philosophy of Curating, Processed Text: despit write almost centuri apart two author sociabl surprisingli similar way sociabl address modal could seen altern limit relat domest profession life two sphere found social unsatisfactori sinc interact limit number peopl set role

TEXT: 5 Both authors agreed that sociability is thus the condition for, but also the object of, all social action. In sociable situations, we can acquaint ourselves with a variety of forms of life and their ‘peculiarities’, free from the necessity to follow precise rules, we can be our own legislators and play a ‘social game’ of interaction based completely upon our ‘personalities’, since ‘no determinate activity has to be collectively executed, no oeuvre has to be realized in common, no knowledge has to be methodically acquired’., NR: 1116, Book ID: A Philosophy of Curating, Processed Text: author agre sociabl thu condit also object social action sociabl situat acquaint varieti form life peculiar free necess follow precis rule legisl play social game interact base complet upon person sinc determin activ ha collect execut ha common knowledg ha method acquir

TEXT: 7 So far, all nice and good. But what kind of actually lived situations are we supposed to envision when thinking about this concept of sociable conduct? What practices are able to conjure up the idea of sociability? Even though both Schleiermacher and Simmel spoke at the level of abstract speculation, looking for universal rules that could capture the subtle equilibrium that can preserve sociable encounters, their thought had to be based on much more quotidian and actual lived experiences, and it may be worthwhile here to look at what they actually did when they wanted to practise sociability., NR: 1118, Book ID: A Philosophy of Curating, Processed Text: far nice good kind actual live situat suppos envis think concept sociabl conduct practic abl conjur idea sociabl even though spoke level abstract specul look univers rule could captur subtl equilibrium preserv sociabl encount thought base much quotidian actual live experi may look actual sociabl
TEXT:  Schleiermacher was an active member of the Jena circle, where he collaborated in the collective project (promoted by Friedrich Schlegel) of the famous romantic journal Athenaeum. The Romantics used the formula of the salon, regular meetings populated by chosen intellectuals (particularly popular and important to the Romantic movement were the ones hosted by Rahel Varnhagen and Henriette Herz in Berlin and other German cities), to promote their vision and values, and to practise what Schlegel called interestingly Symphilosophie and Sympoesie: ‘philosophising and composing poetry together’., NR: 1119, Book ID: A Philosophy of Curating, Processed Text: wa activ member circl collect project famou romant journal athenaeum romant use formula salon regular meet chosen intellectu particularli popular import romant movement one berlin german citi promot vision valu interestingli poetri togeth

TEXT:  The salon was the social ritual par excellence of the European aristocracy prior to the French Revolution, and it continued to exist (although with a different social function) until the 1830s. While historians agree that the salon ‘contributed to the creation of a quasi-public sphere by cultivating the expression of political opinions and philosophical discussion that were, inevitably before 1789, generally critical of the monarchy and the church’,10 this sociable ambience also maintained many conservative and elitist traits., NR: 1124, Book ID: A Philosophy of Curating, Processed Text: salon wa social ritual par excel aristocraci prior revolut continu exist although differ social function historian agre salon creation quasi public sphere express polit opinion philosoph discuss inevit gener critic monarchi church sociabl ambienc also mani conserv trait
TEXT:  For instance, while the central figure of the salon was often a woman, a salonniere, whose task was to preside over the unfolding of harmonious, congenial, philosophical conversations among a mixture of respectable men (old and new rich) of the high society, her role was not that of a feminist in any way: the presence of the salon mistress usually ensured the appropriate kind of behaviour on the part of men, who would, for instance, feel an obligation to smooth the rough edges of political discussions., NR: 1125, Book ID: A Philosophy of Curating, Processed Text: instanc central figur salon wa often woman whose task wa presid unfold harmoni congeni philosoph convers among mixtur respect men old new rich high societi role wa feminist way presenc salon mistress usual appropri kind behaviour part men would instanc feel oblig smooth rough edg polit discuss

TEXT:  This is peculiar and worthy of attention, as these people actually did have able bodies but they preferred to do things with words: a specific modality of co-presence, a specific relationship with the world that implies the presence of other kinds of actors who could be trusted to carry out whatever was discussed in the parlour: as this very name proclaims, the egalitarian or agonistic sociability of the ‘circle’ delimits a discreet space where the most classical division of labour gets actualized: the division between planners (inside the circumference) and executioners (outside)., NR: 1130, Book ID: A Philosophy of Curating, Processed Text: peculiar worthi attent peopl actual abl bodi prefer thing word specif modal presenc specif relationship world presenc kind actor could carri whatev wa name egalitarian agonist sociabl circl discreet space classic divis labour get divis planner insid circumfer execution outsid
TEXT:  Furthermore, it is a specific body that participates in these conversations. It is an abstract body made of properties and based on propriety. In the words of David Graeber: ‘The logic of setting an abstract being apart necessarily involves setting it off against something; in practice, that always seems to mean creating a residual category of people – if not some racial or ethnic category, then workers, the poor, losers in the economic game – who are seen as chaotic, corporeal, animalistic, dangerous., NR: 1131, Book ID: A Philosophy of Curating, Processed Text: furthermor specif bodi convers abstract bodi made properti base proprieti word logic set abstract apart necessarili set someth practic alway mean residu categori peopl racial ethnic categori worker poor loser econom game seen chaotic corpor animalist danger

TEXT:  René Magritte is therefore not the first to conceive this picture-space as the ineluctable horizon of thinking before which pictures always refer only to other pictures. Even in the seventeenth century, this special space of representation refers first and foremost to itself, the representation of representation., NR: 1197, Book ID: A Philosophy of Curating, Processed Text: therefor first conceiv pictur space ineluct horizon think pictur alway refer pictur even seventeenth centuri special space represent first foremost represent represent
TEXT:  Yet, in doing so, it depicts not only self-referentially itself, it also includes specific forms of relations in its field of vision: relations between the concrete picture-space and the space of pictures, between the people who populate the picture-space (the painter and the prince, for example), between them and the spaces and pictures to which each is assigned and finally between the picture-space/space of pictures and an exterior space, which is in most instances only hinted at., NR: 1198, Book ID: A Philosophy of Curating, Processed Text: yet self referenti also specif form relat field vision relat concret pictur space space pictur peopl popul pictur space painter princ exampl space pictur assign final pictur space space pictur exterior space instanc
TEXT:  The selection of the pictures and the way they are arranged increasingly also come to define the volatile power of these relations on the level of substance. Starting in the eighteenth century, the growing historical dimension in particular swells this space of imagination to a phantasmatic magnitude into which reflections on the meaning of history, on processes of the formation of consciousness and on psychological dispositions find themselves., NR: 1199, Book ID: A Philosophy of Curating, Processed Text: select pictur way increasingli also come defin volatil power relat level substanc start eighteenth centuri grow histor dimens particular swell space imagin phantasmat magnitud reflect mean histori process format conscious psycholog disposit find
TEXT:  Giovanni Battista Piranesi, notably, reinterprets the accumulation of historic remnants into pictures of the internalization of imperial space. A thread leads from there to the abysmal collection-spaces in John Soane, and finally to that peculiar collector, Sigmund Freud, who will translate the space of the collection into the topology of psychological functions., NR: 1200, Book ID: A Philosophy of Curating, Processed Text: notabl accumul histor remnant pictur intern imperi space thread lead abysm collect space final peculiar collector translat space collect topolog psycholog function
TEXT: 5 The time of the collection accordingly appears primarily as a function of a particular mode of spatial arrangement. The nineteenth century witnesses the gradual ascent of historical forms of presentation that increasingly transform the space of pictures into the line of a sequential flow., NR: 1201, Book ID: A Philosophy of Curating, Processed Text: time collect accordingli primarili function particular mode spatial arrang nineteenth centuri wit gradual ascent histor form present increasingli transform space pictur line sequenti flow
TEXT:  The dynamisms governing this sequence, however, lend themselves to the most diverse interpretations – from progressive development to catastrophic demise.

TEXT:  It ascribes to every work the internalized logic of a process, understood as obeying quasi-natural laws that take place between various polar principles, the ‘fundamental concepts of art history’.

TEXT:  Yet even here, progress and regression are in balance – in the sense of the eternal recurrence of the same forever unchanging sequences, of corso and ricorso, as Giambattista Vico had described them. Now modern art does not simply take the side of progress., NR: 1204, Book ID: A Philosophy of Curating, Processed Text: yet even progress regress balanc sens etern recurr forev unchang sequenc modern art doe simpli take side progress
TEXT:  It seeks instead to internalize the principle of genealogy and thereby to overcome once and for all the cycle of recurrence and, with it, representation. Each work conceives itself as standing at a particular moment in time and executing the logical consequence of the development of the historical ‘condition of the material’ (Adorno)., NR: 1205, Book ID: A Philosophy of Curating, Processed Text: seek instead intern principl genealog therebi overcom cycl recurr represent work stand particular moment time logic consequ develop histor condit materi
TEXT:  This aspiration must be read not simply as seeking progress over some tradition, whatever its nature, but as the innermost consequence of that tradition. In other words, forces from within the tradition urge the work to transcend it., NR: 1206, Book ID: A Philosophy of Curating, Processed Text: aspir must read simpli seek progress tradit whatev natur innermost consequ tradit word forc within tradit urg work transcend
TEXT:  Modern art accordingly embodies these forces of tradition itself, suspending its own ambition to transcend the tradition. Nor does modern art escape representation; to the contrary, enlisting the assistance of genealogy, it drives representation to its extreme., NR: 1207, Book ID: A Philosophy of Curating, Processed Text: modern art accordingli forc tradit ambit transcend tradit doe modern art escap represent contrari assist genealog drive represent extrem
TEXT:  That becomes clear once we understand that representation, far from being the illusionistic depiction of a particular reality, is an expectation of significance brought to the symbolic form of the tableau., NR: 1208, Book ID: A Philosophy of Curating, Processed Text: becom clear understand represent far illusionist depict particular realiti expect signific brought symbol form tableau
TEXT:  In this sense, Piet Mondrian and Kazimir Malevich mark not the cancellation of the representational regime but its essence in a heightened form in which the very overcoming of representation as depiction allows for the attainment of another, ‘representative’ meaning: in the true ‘Suprematism’, the picture is charged with an ultimate and universal worldliness., NR: 1209, Book ID: A Philosophy of Curating, Processed Text: sens piet mark cancel regim essenc form represent depict attain anoth repres mean true supremat pictur ultim univers worldli
TEXT:  With regard to the question of placement in the space of pictures, both positions remain torn between turning to a radical isolation of the picture, which will finally be realized in the form of presentation known as the White Cube, and transforming the ‘theatre of pictures’ into the endeavours towards a total work of art undertaken by De Stijl and the Constructivists., NR: 1210, Book ID: A Philosophy of Curating, Processed Text: regard question placement space pictur posit remain torn turn radic isol pictur final form present known white cube transform pictur toward total work art constructivist
TEXT:  Modern art, then, is certainly not only modern. It adopts the early modern idea of representation precisely where it seems to repudiate it. And the idea of an inner genealogical principle does not help it escape history; on the contrary, it inscribes it only the more deeply in that history., NR: 1211, Book ID: A Philosophy of Curating, Processed Text: modern art certainli modern earli modern idea represent precis repudi idea inner genealog principl doe help escap histori contrari deepli histori

TEXT:  Particularly indicative of this fact are the enlightenment myths of liberation and universality it has appropriated to itself. That appropriation should not lead us to forget, however, that these myths are also variants of a specific hegemonic narrative form that must even today be understood as a reflection of the same tradition it pretends to have overcome., NR: 1213, Book ID: A Philosophy of Curating, Processed Text: particularli indic fact enlighten myth liber univers ha appropri lead forget howev myth also variant specif hegemon narr form must even today understood reflect tradit pretend overcom
TEXT:  That means that no end to the ‘representational regime’ is in sight. The collection as a metaphor of the accumulation of wealth or capital, but also of symbolic worldliness and power, and its coordinates in time-space continue to define the specificity of a culture just as a European or more generally Western culture seeks to enforce a dominant reading of globalization., NR: 1214, Book ID: A Philosophy of Curating, Processed Text: mean end regim sight collect metaphor accumul wealth capit also symbol worldli power time space continu defin specif cultur gener western cultur seek enforc domin read
TEXT:  So we need a critical revisionism that examines the mythical potential of the narrative form of modern art, tracing its criteria and categorizations and the inclusions and exclusions they give rise to as well as the representational and genealogical logics on which it is based., NR: 1215, Book ID: A Philosophy of Curating, Processed Text: need critic revision mythic potenti narr form modern art trace criterion categor inclus exclus give rise well genealog logic base
TEXT:  Such a revisionism would probably allow us to adopt a different perspective on the structural dynamisms concealed by one-dimensional logics of autonomous development, a perspective in which the interdependency between different processes of modernization would be the precondition for understanding the internal as well as external multiplicities6 that, we might come to realize, make up ‘modern art’, with all the tensions defining its contemporary manifestations, between on the one hand, the theatre of pictures on billboards and social networks and, on the other, the theatre of art staged by the global art business., NR: 1216, Book ID: A Philosophy of Curating, Processed Text: revision would probabl allow adopt differ perspect structur dynam conceal one dimension logic autonom develop perspect interdepend differ process modern would precondit understand intern well extern multipl might come realiz make modern art tension contemporari manifest one hand pictur billboard social network art stage global art busi

TEXT:  As such, they do not belong to the sphere of art. The first thesis in the 1935 essay tells us why: each period has their own sensibilities.

TEXT:  The main question for aesthetics is therefore to determine their own configurations or what Rancière calls, in a rather restrictive fashion, their ‘aesthetic regimes’. This is restrictive because Walter Benjamin’s thesis does not limit itself to particular literary (Flaubert) or philosophical patterns (Plato, Aristotle)., NR: 1224, Book ID: A Philosophy of Curating, Processed Text: main question aesthet therefor determin configur call rather restrict fashion aesthet regim restrict walter benjamin thesi doe limit particular literari philosoph pattern

TEXT:  This event obviously supposes the creation of a technical device: the exhibition in the eighteenth century or the radio in Germany in 1920, for example. Let me take the radio as an example.

TEXT:  This short-lived aesthetic period was soon replaced by a period dedicated to political communications, and specifically from 1933, to propaganda in the name of mass mobilization.

TEXT: 0. Things have not changed. Overall, one can then surmise that a new medium of communication that is able to generate artistic productions – of the art-device variety – becomes an aesthetic device that, because of its endless reconfigurations, effectively knows no end., NR: 1231, Book ID: A Philosophy of Curating, Processed Text: thing overal one surmis new medium commun abl gener artist product art devic varieti becom aesthet devic endless effect know end
TEXT:  The oldest of such an aesthetic device, the camera obscura, for example, is still operative as the recent work of Christine Felten and Veronique Massinger clearly testifies.2 Although he devoted crucial pages to narration, photography, and cinema, Walter Benjamin never wrote, besides a few theoretical notes, about the radio or about exhibitions., NR: 1232, Book ID: A Philosophy of Curating, Processed Text: aesthet devic camera exampl still oper recent work clearli although devot crucial page narrat photographi cinema walter benjamin never wrote besid theoret note radio exhibit
TEXT:  However, this might not necessarily be due to a lack of opportunity. If an aesthetic device (perspective, for example) generates a new understanding of what an event stands for, and therefore what a show means, a medium of communication, by contrast, only ever imposes itself by shortening space and time., NR: 1233, Book ID: A Philosophy of Curating, Processed Text: howev might necessarili due lack opportun aesthet devic perspect exampl new understand event stand therefor show mean medium commun contrast ever shorten space time

TEXT:  Benjamin’s innovation is to refuse this secondariness by invoking the name. For Benjamin, the name is what really configures form. Benjamin’s aesthetic gives prominence to naming. This is clearly shown in his Small History of Photography, in which Benjamin criticizes the political pretensions of objective photography because it shows factories as if a photograph could denounce historical social realities on its own! Images need to be named; photographs require tags., NR: 1249, Book ID: A Philosophy of Curating, Processed Text: benjamin innov refus secondari name benjamin name realli form benjamin aesthet give promin name clearli shown small histori photographi benjamin polit pretens object photographi show factori photograph could denounc histor social realiti imag need photograph requir tag

TEXT:  The name as the identifiable form is what stands for the surface of (re)production.

Her report is rife with suggestions of inner conflicts and contradictions within the insular communities (Bhutias or Lepchas); but never within the majority of Nepalese (75% of the population) who, by her description, have occupied the region since the 1860s with the result of unsettling the traditional Bhutia Lepcha populace and reducing it to a mere 20 per cent., NR: 1268, Book ID: A Philosophy of Curating, Processed Text: economi conflict posit often express albeit subtli report rife suggest inner conflict contradict within insular commun never within major popul descript region sinc result unsettl tradit populac reduc mere per cent

TEXT:  In this essay, I argue that ‘memory-film’, or mnemopolitical cinema, a genre coined by Russell Kilbourn in his Cinema, Memory, Modernity, appears to assign priority to the set design, or the narrative organization of cinematic space, through visible, audible and intelligible objects of contested histories: mnemopolitical film directors working in different traditions of world cinema mostly use film as a narrative device to express selected spaces (especially haunted places of past violence) or use cinematic space to express selected narratives (especially traumatic stories of massacres, ethnic conflicts and forced migrations)., NR: 1334, Book ID: A Philosophy of Curating, Processed Text: essay argu memori film cinema genr cinema memori modern assign prioriti set design narr organ cinemat space visibl audibl intellig object histori film director work differ tradit world cinema mostli use film narr devic express select space especi place past violenc use cinemat space express select narr especi traumat stori massacr ethnic conflict forc migrat

TEXT:  They appear to be ghostly objects that speak for themselves as traces of catastrophic events, allegories of violent encounters or fragments of other histories.

TEXT:  All these catastrophic moments have remained either less known or entirely unknown to the public and have rarely been recorded in history books until the 2000s.

TEXT:  As Asuman Suner points out, home, distance, border and migration have appeared to be repeated themes in the new wave cinema of Turkey.9 Revolving around individual stories, geographies of oblivion and minor histories with autobiographical elements, films such as Distant (Uzak, Nuri Bilge Ceylan, 2002) and Distant (Dûr, Kazım Öz, 2005) obsessively aim at exploring the experience of being in a perpetual transition, or of living in the endless moment of in-betweenness with anti-heroic characters living on the margins of the global urban culture., NR: 1347, Book ID: A Philosophy of Curating, Processed Text: point home distanc border migrat repeat theme new wave cinema turkey revolv around individu stori geographi oblivion minor histori element film distant bilg distant aim explor experi perpetu transit live endless moment between anti heroic charact live margin global urban cultur
TEXT:  There are also remarkable films whose characters are those living on the borders of the nation state. Although we find in the Yeşilçam period of Turkish cinema (early 1950s–late 1980s) early examples of what Hamid Naficy calls ‘the cinema of borders’10 such as The Law of the Border (Hudutların Kanunu, Ömer Lütfi Akad, 1966), the post-Yeşilçam films take the issue in a more radical manner in the sense that they problematize the hegemonic politics of the border and demand from their spectators to reconsider the functions of borders in the postmodern globalized world., NR: 1348, Book ID: A Philosophy of Curating, Processed Text: also remark film whose charact live border nation state although find period cinema earli late earli exampl call cinema border law border omer post film take issu radic manner sens problemat hegemon polit border demand spectat reconsid function border world
TEXT:  In the traditional sense, borders function in order to establish identities, namely to invent lines of division between a mythical ‘us’ and an equally mythical ‘them’. As Étienne Balibar explains, ‘Every discussion of borders relates, precisely, to the establishment of definite identities, national or otherwise., NR: 1349, Book ID: A Philosophy of Curating, Processed Text: tradit sens border function order establish ident name invent line divis mythic equal mythic everi discuss border precis establish definit ident nation otherwis
TEXT: ’11 Balibar considers ‘borders’ as convenient instruments which are used by the state to reduce the complexity of identifying, namely to ‘fix’ identities that are, in practice, not very well defined. One of these border-films is Mud (Çamur, Derviş Zaim, 2003), in which the Turkish Cypriot director’s use of the Green Line (the border between the northern and southern sides of Cyprus that separates the city of Lefkoşa/Nicosia into two) intends to reveal the spectral condition of the social life on the island while unsettling the spectator’s sense of place and worldliness: within the framing of this cinematic exhibition of the Wall, border as a visible–invisible line of division means a place of disjunction, unbelonging and intercommunal struggles – thus exposing an architecture of enmity., NR: 1350, Book ID: A Philosophy of Curating, Processed Text: border conveni instrument use state reduc complex name fix ident practic well defin one border film mud director use green line border northern southern side separ citi two reveal spectral condit social life island unsettl spectat sens place worldli within frame cinemat exhibit wall border visibl invis line divis mean place disjunct unbelong intercommun struggl thu architectur enmiti
TEXT:  Zaim’s cinematico-curatorial practice deconstructs the Green Line and calls for a reconsideration of its spectral condition and political meaning: this impermeable border is obviously the ghostly trace of violent past encounters between Greek Cypriots and Turkish Cypriots in 1963 and 1974, but should it continue to exist, implying as it does the so-called impossibility of coexistence? As Cockburn lucidly explains, the Cyprus Partition Line strictly defines the political conditions of living together for Cypriots, having different meanings at different levels: although the Wall became a relatively permeable border in 2004, it still exists as a ghostly entity that signals that there is an inaccessible outside for Turkish and Greek Cypriots and that this outside has been invented and maintained through an ethnocentric territorial order: ., NR: 1351, Book ID: A Philosophy of Curating, Processed Text: curatori practic green line call reconsider spectral condit polit mean imperm border obvious ghostli trace violent past encount continu exist doe imposs coexist lucidli partit line strictli polit condit live togeth differ mean differ level although wall rel permeabl border still ghostli entiti signal inaccess outsid outsid ha ethnocentr territori order

TEXT:  And at the global level, it has symbolic meaning as the fence between the West and the Rest.12 By exhibiting Cyprus as a ‘garrison island’ with armed guards and ‘forbidden’ signs, Zaim’s Cyprus trilogy (Mud, Parallel Trips and Shadows and Faces) aims at creating a kind of cartographic disorientation in the spectators to allows them to be estranged from a normalized and naturalized political geography: in order to unframe the political geography and defend the primacy of human geography, these films indirectly constitute examples of experimental cartography that map a cinematic terra incognita, an unknown possible future territory, a co-inhabited space in which one presence is not at the expense of the other., NR: 1353, Book ID: A Philosophy of Curating, Processed Text: global level ha symbol mean fenc west rest garrison island arm guard forbidden sign trilog mud parallel trip shadow face aim kind cartograph disorient spectat polit geographi order unfram polit geographi defend primaci human geographi film indirectli constitut exampl experiment cartographi map cinemat incognita unknown possibl futur territori inhabit space one presenc expens
TEXT:  Further, in his cinematic landscape of Cyprus, Zaim subtly creates a contrast between the spaces of security (borders and garrisons that signify disintegrated and alienated souls of the East Mediterranean after 1974) and the spaces of intimacy (homes, narrow streets and local spaces of shared life on the island before 1964) to emphasize the forced evolution of the friend/neighbour into the foe., NR: 1354, Book ID: A Philosophy of Curating, Processed Text: cinemat landscap subtli contrast space secur border garrison signifi soul east mediterranean space intimaci home narrow street local space life island emphas forc evolut friend foe
TEXT: 13 As Balibar states, borders turn neighbours into strangers first, and then turn those strangers into enemies.14 For example, Greek Cypriot actress Popi Avraam who played one of the main characters, Anna, in the last film of Zaim’s Cyprus trilogy, Shadows and Faces, recounts how she started thinking about her identity as a young girl when her Turkish Cypriot neighbours were forced to leave their homes: ‘We were just children., NR: 1355, Book ID: A Philosophy of Curating, Processed Text: state border turn stranger first turn stranger enemi exampl actress one main charact anna last film trilog shadow face recount think ident young girl forc leav home child
TEXT:  When our Turkish neighbours began to abandon their homes, I remember thinking, “Who are these people? Who are the Turks? And who are we?”’15 Whereas Zaim’s counter-geopolitical camera focuses on the invention of the border in the postcolonial Cyprus, Turkish Kurdish filmmaker Hüseyin Karabey’s road movie My Marlon and Brando / Gitmek (2008) revolves around the theme of border-crossing and appears as a moving statement on the confining artificiality of borders., NR: 1356, Book ID: A Philosophy of Curating, Processed Text: abandon home rememb think peopl turk wherea counter geopolit camera focu invent border postcoloni road movi around theme border cross move statement confin artifici border
TEXT:  Taking place during America’s invasion of Iraq in 2002, Karabey’s film is based on the true story of a cross-border romance between Iraqi Kurdish actor Hama Ali and his Turkish actress girlfriend Ayça Damgacı, revealing an eye-opening cinematic journey across the borders between Turkey, Iraq and Iran: with its striking images from a geography of oblivion, this border-film exposes its spectators to the relegated knowledge about the grim racism and repression faced by Kurds in these three countries., NR: 1357, Book ID: A Philosophy of Curating, Processed Text: take place invas film base true stori cross border romanc actor actress reveal eye open cinemat journey across border turkey strike imag geographi oblivion border film expos spectat knowledg grim racism repress face three countri

TEXT: 16 Moreover, Zaim and Karabey present in their cinematic spaces the memories of borders on both collective and individual levels (border as a site of counter-memory and border-crossing as an act of critical remembering) and in a radical way to make the spectators realize that borders are no longer simply lines of division that frame a national territory, instead they become unremittingly expanding zones where people indefinitely dwell., NR: 1360, Book ID: A Philosophy of Curating, Processed Text: moreov present cinemat space memori border collect individu level border site counter memori border cross act critic radic way make spectat realiz border longer simpli line divis frame nation territori instead becom unremittingli expand zone peopl indefinit dwell

TEXT:  . .’17 Briefly speaking, the border-films of the new cinema in Turkey exhibit borders as sites of catastrophic memories with the purpose of raising an awareness regarding the fact that borders have long stopped functioning as a limit to the political, marking where the political community ends, and started functioning as political entities themselves., NR: 1362, Book ID: A Philosophy of Curating, Processed Text: briefli speak border film new cinema turkey exhibit border site catastroph memori purpos rais awar regard fact border long stop limit polit mark polit commun end polit entiti
TEXT:  In other words, border-films betray how certain forms of radical alterity and enmity are mentally and physically constructed by the geopolitical imaginary and the culture of fear and securitization.

TEXT:  By exhibiting the Turkish teacher’s suffering from his desparate situation of being unable to communicate with his students, the film with its performative style not only allows its Turkish viewers to remember the existence of other languages spoken in Turkey and to rethink of their privilege of having a language, Turkish, that is widely spoken all over the country, but also opens a space for a critical discussion on the right of being educated in one’s mother tongue., NR: 1368, Book ID: A Philosophy of Curating, Processed Text: teacher suffer situat unabl commun student film perform style viewer rememb exist languag spoken turkey rethink privileg languag wide spoken countri also open space critic discuss right educ one mother tongu

TEXT:  While both memory and history are fields of discursive struggle, memory ‘suggests a more dialogic relationship between the temporal constituencies of “now” and “then”’.25 Through its cinematic constellations of ghostly objects, the curatorial mode of filmmaking not only contributes to the neverending process of negotiation and contestation that structures public memory in Turkey, but also provides relevant materials for the post-Kemalist account of an inherently multicultural nation., NR: 1399, Book ID: A Philosophy of Curating, Processed Text: memori histori field discurs struggl memori dialog relationship tempor constitu cinemat constel ghostli object curatori mode process negoti contest structur public memori turkey also relev materi post account inher nation

TEXT:  In doing so, the museum will be able to remove itself from the easy circuit of approval, connoisseurship, patronage, funding that characterizes the global art world. Furthermore, for Lyotard, to be ‘contemporary’ in art is to be contemporary with all of the history of art and its many possibilities – explored or unrealized – and to be unafraid of conditions of anachronism that rupture the homogeneity of museum-time., NR: 1455, Book ID: A Philosophy of Curating, Processed Text: museum abl remov easi circuit approv connoisseurship patronag global art world furthermor contemporari art contemporari histori art mani possibl unreal unafraid condit anachron ruptur homogen museum time
TEXT:  This contemporaneity is nothing less than a religious commitment, even more so in a secular age, where the religious approach is transferred to the realm of culture and values.

One man in particular, a Sikh who is often referred to by the name of his village, Toba Tek Singh, and who is known for never lying or sitting down and for speaking in a garbled, untranslatable mixture of English and Punjabi, becomes terrified at the prospect of ending up in Pakistan and insists, at the time of the exchange, that his village Toba Tek Singh is precisely where he himself is standing, facing a border which he refuses to cross., NR: 1460, Book ID: A Philosophy of Curating, Processed Text: inmat specul matter possibl citi one day next find satisfactori answer one man particular often name villag singh known never lie sit speak untranslat mixtur becom prospect end time exchang villag singh precis stand face border refus cross
TEXT:  In the final moments of the story, Toba Tek Singh is found pitched face forward on the barbed wire, in the no man’s land that separates India from Pakistan. In the identification of the lunatic and the name of the place he comes from, and in the eventual resting place he finds on the boundary line of hostility and division, there should be a dark lesson., NR: 1461, Book ID: A Philosophy of Curating, Processed Text: final moment stori singh found face forward barb wire man land separ identif lunat name place come eventu rest place find boundari line hostil divis dark lesson

TEXT:  Rather than entering into discussions of the definition of practice, this text argues that the curatorial instigates a very specific form of activity relevant to our contemporary context. This context could be crudely described as a state of acceleration and movement, producing a crisis that is simultaneously financial, social and cultural and, at the same time, conceptual in manner., NR: 1474, Book ID: A Philosophy of Curating, Processed Text: rather enter discuss definit practic text curatori specif form activ relev contemporari context context could crude state acceler movement crisi simultan financi social cultur time conceptu manner
TEXT:  This crisis has been typified as the move from the centralization inherent in the Foucauldian model of ‘disciplinary society’ in which individuals fit into the institutionalization of life according to their given role, to the Deleuzian model of ‘control society’: a decentred, individualistic and highly creative mode in which individuals constantly modulate their behaviour through forms of competitive self-governance., NR: 1475, Book ID: A Philosophy of Curating, Processed Text: crisi ha move central inher model disciplinari societi individu fit life accord given role model control societi individualist highli creativ mode individu constantli modul behaviour form competit self govern
TEXT:  In brief, the contention is that the constant modulation and movement of this system creates an opacity in which everything, all of the time, is in flux and formation. Curatorial activity insinuates itself within this context in the manner of a diagrammatic operation: a methodology that attempts to organize or make sense of this chaotic and ever-changing world., NR: 1476, Book ID: A Philosophy of Curating, Processed Text: brief content constant modul movement system opac everyth time flux format curatori activ within context manner diagrammat oper methodolog attempt organ make sens chaotic ever world
TEXT:  The diagram, therefore, gives form to a world that is otherwise abstract, obtuse and chaotic: as a diagrammatic operation, the curatorial is what, here, we will term the sensible stage.2 Thinking about the curatorial as a sensible stage is to focus on the emergence of subjects and ideas through the exhibitionary structure., NR: 1477, Book ID: A Philosophy of Curating, Processed Text: diagram therefor give form world otherwis abstract obtus chaotic diagrammat oper curatori term sensibl stage think curatori sensibl stage focu emerg subject idea structur
TEXT:  This definition of the curatorial dispels or disregards the debates surrounding the para-curatorial for example, and, instead, favours an expanded notion of practice that focuses on its operation and what this operation makes visible., NR: 1478, Book ID: A Philosophy of Curating, Processed Text: definit curatori disregard debat surround para curatori exampl instead expand notion practic focu oper oper make visibl
TEXT:  Furthermore the concept of the sensible stage provides a motif for two contrary tendencies within current curatorial practice: on the one hand, what could be termed a shared-authorship that emerges through a given situation., NR: 1479, Book ID: A Philosophy of Curating, Processed Text: furthermor concept sensibl stage motif two contrari tendenc within current curatori practic one hand could authorship given situat
TEXT:  This is an immersion into the commonality of the sensible in which the body of the curator is literally submerged in the ‘common sensorium’ of all bodies in the situation.3 On the other hand, the concept of the stage provides the opportunity to force a split or rupture within this immersive commonality of the sensible, reinserting representation and spectatorship into this situation., NR: 1480, Book ID: A Philosophy of Curating, Processed Text: immers common sensibl bodi curat liter submerg common sensorium bodi situat hand concept stage opportun forc split ruptur within immers common sensibl represent spectatorship situat
TEXT:  In a paper presented at the Société française de philosophie on 28 January 1967, Deleuze presented the concept of ‘dramatization’ or what he called ‘the method of dramatization’. Deeply embedded in the movement and expressionism of his early work, dramatization provides Deleuze with a method that articulates the ‘spatio-temporal dynamisms’ that serve to bubble up, splurge forth or actualize the Idea., NR: 1481, Book ID: A Philosophy of Curating, Processed Text: paper concept dramat method dramat deepli movement expression earli work dramat method tempor dynam serv bubbl splurg forth actual idea
TEXT:  Put very crudely, what this means is that rather than being the result of a Platonic demand (what? how?), the idea is actualized through the particular dynamics inherent in a particular time and place: a ‘special theatre’, Deleuze calls it., NR: 1482, Book ID: A Philosophy of Curating, Processed Text: put crude mean rather result demand idea particular dynam inher particular time place special call
TEXT: 4 Through the ‘agitations of space, pockets of time, pure syntheses of speeds, directions and rhythms’, this dramatization enables the emergence of subjects and, of course, ideas.5 However, because these subjects and ideas are produced through the situation itself – through a kind of subterranean dynamic that exists ‘beneath organization’, ‘a system filled with qualities and developed in extension’ – there is a constant threat of not emerging or disintegrating back into obscurity., NR: 1483, Book ID: A Philosophy of Curating, Processed Text: agit space pocket time pure synthesi speed direct rhythm dramat emerg subject cours idea howev subject idea produc situat kind subterranean dynam beneath organ system fill qualiti extens constant threat back obscur
TEXT: 6 The concept of the sensible stage counters this threat of obscurification by locating the stage as a highly visible site of encounter. The sensible stage exists somewhere between the emergent dramatization of intensities (or differences) and the rupturing or splintering7 of these through a theatrical mode that suggests the reassertion of a dialectical force., NR: 1484, Book ID: A Philosophy of Curating, Processed Text: concept sensibl stage counter threat stage highli visibl site encount sensibl stage somewher emerg dramat intens differ theatric mode reassert dialect forc
TEXT:  This approach accepts the ‘para’ activities of the curatorial as a given and, instead, focuses its interest on what is made visible and how, that is, the moment of encounter or staging. Here curatorial practice is intrinsically performative because it is bound up with the moment of encounter: it is realized through a coming together of its component parts that can only ever be encountered in the instant., NR: 1485, Book ID: A Philosophy of Curating, Processed Text: approach para activ curatori given instead focu interest made visibl moment encount stage curatori practic intrins perform bound moment encount come togeth compon part ever instant
TEXT:  In addition, and most importantly, this definition of the curatorial as a diagrammatic activity acknowledges an understanding of our contemporary context that is characterized by movement. This is an acceleration of the logics of flow, dissemination and collapse that is apparent in Deleuze and Guattari’s work for example, and is addressed by theorists working today who characterize the current crises of neoliberalism through these dynamics (our crisis, its effectiveness)., NR: 1486, Book ID: A Philosophy of Curating, Processed Text: addit importantli definit curatori diagrammat activ understand contemporari context movement acceler logic flow dissemin collaps appar work exampl theorist work today character current crisi dynam crisi effect

TEXT:  It’s an architecture created through movement. Plastic. Mobile. Mutable. Myriad Mouth Line creates a temporary space for its own emergence.

TEXT:  Tolmie describes Myriad Mouth Line in distinctly filmic terms, breaking the performance down into a series of five frames that she unpacks and critiques in the final, fifth frame. The effect of this approach is to emphasize the temporal fragility of the space that she creates for and through the work., NR: 1492, Book ID: A Philosophy of Curating, Processed Text: myriad mouth line distinctli filmic term break perform seri five frame critiqu final fifth frame effect approach emphas tempor fragil space work
TEXT:  Furthermore, the equation with a filmic process of projection acts to further articulate a sense of contingency within the work so that our attention is directed to the performance as a moment that appears out of a generalized formlessness., NR: 1493, Book ID: A Philosophy of Curating, Processed Text: furthermor equat filmic process project act articul sens conting within work attent direct perform moment gener formless

TEXT:  Evoking the apparatus of film in this way means that Tolmie is able to activate something important about the projection of film itself: it simultaneously appears and is transformed through its appearance., NR: 1495, Book ID: A Philosophy of Curating, Processed Text: apparatu film way mean abl activ someth import project film simultan appear
TEXT:  This is to suggest, therefore, that in Myriad Mouth Line, the body of the performer is simultaneously projected on the stage as well as creating (outlining, delineating, activating) the stage for its own appearance., NR: 1496, Book ID: A Philosophy of Curating, Processed Text: suggest therefor myriad mouth line bodi perform simultan stage well stage appear

TEXT:  Tolmie’s action of self-realization through the staging of the apparatus of the performance (the delineation of the stage) and herself as a subject that appears within this stage is a method of dramatization akin to that proposed by Deleuze., NR: 1498, Book ID: A Philosophy of Curating, Processed Text: action self realiz stage apparatu perform delin stage subject within stage method dramat akin
TEXT:  Understanding the projection of images (analogue or digital) as a moment of appearing and actualization provides a means for understanding the concept of the diagram, particularly in relation to a world in which images move around us continually in an undifferentiated flow: they are everywhere and nowhere – a fleeting flash of colour, a suggestion of colour that is at once visual and synaesthetic: as much a feeling as a seeing., NR: 1499, Book ID: A Philosophy of Curating, Processed Text: understand project imag analogu digit moment actual mean understand concept diagram particularli relat world imag move around continu flow everywher nowher fleet flash colour suggest colour visual much feel see
TEXT:  This abstract movement or flow of images is no gentle or meandering durational activity but rather a speedy and savage chaotic surge of affects where bodies and images are collapsed together into one massive tidal wave of information that’s rich with potentiality and potent with chaotic drives., NR: 1500, Book ID: A Philosophy of Curating, Processed Text: abstract movement flow imag gentl durat activ rather speedi savag chaotic surg affect bodi imag togeth one massiv tidal wave inform rich potenti potent chaotic drive

TEXT:  The diagram therefore describes the lines along which the inside and outside (immersion and emergence) fold together, separate, re-fold and so on. And, the curatorial stage emerges along these lines: the result of a series of pressures that force it out of the ‘thickness of the body’ or bodies together., NR: 1502, Book ID: A Philosophy of Curating, Processed Text: diagram therefor line along insid outsid immers emerg fold togeth separ fold curatori stage along line result seri pressur forc thick bodi bodi togeth

TEXT:  Thus producing what we have termed here the act of staging. The concept of staging provides a means for understanding curatorial activity whether an exhibition, time-based event, talk or screening as a moment of appearance that occurs through (and despite) the contesting movements of disintegration and potentiality., NR: 1504, Book ID: A Philosophy of Curating, Processed Text: thu act stage concept stage mean understand curatori activ whether exhibit time base event talk screen moment appear despit movement disintegr potenti
TEXT:  Furthermore through its etymological links to theatre, architecture as well as rupture and time, staging is a counter force to the ‘deep’ abstraction of movement and extension. In this way, staging offers us a double-action because it simultaneously recognizes our immersion in the unfolding action and at the same time it separates us from it, offering us the view from ‘outside’ of the stage: a position of spectatorship., NR: 1505, Book ID: A Philosophy of Curating, Processed Text: furthermor etymolog link architectur well ruptur time stage counter forc deep abstract movement extens way stage offer doubl action simultan immers unfold action time separ offer view outsid stage posit spectatorship
TEXT:  In his book, Theatricality as Medium, Samuel Weber articulates this privileging of sight in the etymology of theatre as a ‘desire for exteriority and control’.10 However at the same time, Weber highlights the immersive impetus of self-presence within theatre in which ‘thinking and being are the same’., NR: 1506, Book ID: A Philosophy of Curating, Processed Text: book theatric medium weber sight etymolog desir exterior control howev time weber highlight immers impetu self presenc within think
TEXT:  The doubling produces, according to Weber, a constantly divided or split subject in relation to theatre, that is a subject that is split between ‘life and death, spectator and actor, strange and familiar’., NR: 1507, Book ID: A Philosophy of Curating, Processed Text: doubl produc accord weber constantli divid split subject relat subject split life death spectat actor strang familiar
TEXT: 11 If we attempt to define the concept of staging in the same manner, we achieve a to-ing and fro-ing between a time and place that is, on the one hand, causal – that is, it surges forth, the result of a build-up of pressure and forces – and, on the other hand, is an imposed or divisive structure., NR: 1508, Book ID: A Philosophy of Curating, Processed Text: attempt defin concept stage manner achiev ing fro ing time place one hand causal surg forth result build pressur forc hand divis structur
TEXT:  It is the tension between the two that gives a frailty to the notion of staging as something that occurs in between an organic causality and an imposed structure. Like the twin motifs of dramatization and diagram (the drive towards ‘pure spatio-temporal dynamism’ on the one hand and organization and legibility on the other), the sensible and the stage offer a means for accentuating the counter-pull between these forces., NR: 1509, Book ID: A Philosophy of Curating, Processed Text: tension two give frailti notion stage someth organ causal structur like twin motif dramat diagram drive toward pure tempor dynam one hand organ legibl sensibl stage offer mean counter pull forc
TEXT:  Alain Badiou has described theatre as the coming together of the body and text in the presence of a public (which is itself created by the occasion of the theatre itself). We could say in this way that theatre is both aleatoric and contingent – the result of a meeting between bodies and text – and at the same time deeply causal because it is produced through and by these bodies meeting., NR: 1510, Book ID: A Philosophy of Curating, Processed Text: ha come togeth bodi text presenc public occas could say way conting result meet bodi text time deepli causal produc bodi meet
TEXT:  What this means for the curatorial, then, is that it is a procedure that is both produced through the situation (i.e. its singularity emerges from the sum of its parts, the meeting of body and text) and at the same time it is an outside factor – an organizing principle that brings things together to produce something new., NR: 1511, Book ID: A Philosophy of Curating, Processed Text: mean curatori procedur produc situat singular sum part meet bodi text time outsid factor principl thing togeth produc someth new

TEXT:  What this means is that the stage of our encounter – the exhibition, the gallery or museum, the talk, the theatre, the screening and so on, all of these things – provide a structural framework that pre-exists the encounter with the body but they do so as a kind of virtual or possible that is itself dramatized through the encounter with the body., NR: 1516, Book ID: A Philosophy of Curating, Processed Text: mean stage encount exhibit galleri museum talk screen thing provid structur framework encount bodi kind virtual possibl encount bodi
TEXT:  In this way, the sensible stage proposes a path between the emergent intensity of Deleuze’s dramatization and Badiou’s articulation of theatre as the meeting of bodies and text. Considering the curatorial through this concept of the sensible stage enables us to understand curatorial activity as part of this ‘evolving field of operations’ as Paul O’Neill suggests in a recent essay on the para-curatorial., NR: 1517, Book ID: A Philosophy of Curating, Processed Text: way sensibl stage path emerg intens dramat articul meet bodi text consid curatori concept sensibl stage understand curatori activ part field oper recent essay para curatori

TEXT:  But if, on the other hand, we recognize and capitalize on the contradiction inherent in the diagram, that is the space between the two terms ‘sensible’ and ‘stage’ (the contrary pull of disintegration and illumination), then, through the motif of staging as a means to propose both separation and immersion at once, the role of the curatorial (whether para or not) is both the action and performance of disruption., NR: 1519, Book ID: A Philosophy of Curating, Processed Text: hand recogn capit contradict inher diagram space two term sensibl stage contrari pull disintegr illumin motif stage mean propos separ immers role curatori whether para action perform disrupt
TEXT:  That is to say, that the curatorial recognizes itself as an inherent part of the activity that it stages and also somehow separates. However it is the reflexivity of this position – a kind of helpless duality of action and retreat – that makes its action powerful because it activates both a desire for autonomy and its impossibility., NR: 1520, Book ID: A Philosophy of Curating, Processed Text: say curatori inher part activ stage also somehow separ howev reflex posit kind helpless dualiti action retreat make action power desir autonomi imposs

TEXT:  What I want to address here is not the activity of making exhibitions – setting up artworks for display, for example – but rather setting a friction between them and with their surroundings. ‘She is a methodologist of “contextual curating”,’ a colleague of mine once said about me in front of a group of students., NR: 1531, Book ID: A Philosophy of Curating, Processed Text: want address activ make exhibit set display exampl rather set friction surround methodologist contextu colleagu mine said front group student
TEXT:  However astonishing this naming was, it forced me to revisit the process that led me to be given that name. Being addressed as ‘a methodologist’ in a field that has not yet taken shape causes a feeling of responsibility for something that is already being recognized as a practice but is not certain whether or how it can become knowledge and what kind of implications this holds., NR: 1532, Book ID: A Philosophy of Curating, Processed Text: howev astonish name wa forc revisit process led given name methodologist field ha yet taken shape caus feel respons someth alreadi practic certain whether becom knowledg kind implic hold
TEXT:  In his The Practice of Everyday Life, Michel de Certeau defines The Expert as the one who exchanges competence for authority: Ultimately, the more authority the Expert has, the less competence he has, up to the point where his fund of competence is exhausted, like the energy necessary to put a mobile into movement., NR: 1533, Book ID: A Philosophy of Curating, Processed Text: practic everyday life expert one exchang compet author ultim author expert ha less compet ha point fund compet exhaust like energi necessari put mobil movement
TEXT:  During the process of conversion, he is not without some competence (he either has to have some or make people think he has), but he abandons the competence he possesses as his authority is extended further and further, drawn out of its orbit by social demands and/or political responsibilities., NR: 1534, Book ID: A Philosophy of Curating, Processed Text: process convers without compet either ha make peopl think ha abandon compet author extend drawn orbit social demand polit
TEXT:  That is the (general?) paradox of authority: a knowledge is ascribed to it and this knowledge is precisely what it lacks where it is exercised.1 That is to say, the more we put into practical use what we know, the more we see ourselves as situated in a form of practice that is recognized as assigned to us., NR: 1535, Book ID: A Philosophy of Curating, Processed Text: gener paradox author knowledg knowledg precis lack say put practic use know see situat form practic assign
TEXT:  This turns us into an object of study and a fixed point of reference and makes us lose the legitimacy of our inventiveness and of our ability to be politically transformative. Most dramatically, de Certeau writes of The Expert that ‘He misunderstands the order which he represents., NR: 1536, Book ID: A Philosophy of Curating, Processed Text: turn object studi fix point refer make lose legitimaci invent abil polit transform dramat expert order
TEXT:  He no longer knows what he is saying.’2 De Certeau is pointing at the use of objects, symbols or traditions in everyday practice and the way this use gives legitimacy to knowledge (including the banalities, materialities and simplicities of our immediate surroundings)., NR: 1537, Book ID: A Philosophy of Curating, Processed Text: longer know say point use object symbol tradit everyday practic way use give legitimaci knowledg banal materi simplic immedi surround
TEXT:  This expertise then leads to repetitive forms of doing, a repetition that loses the audacity of the inventiveness of the moment of action, thus becoming legitimate and accepted forms of practice.3 These were also my concerns as this supposed ‘methodologist of contextual curating’ that I had become: that I could continue performing in a way that had quickly become normalized as a practice without examining the ethical or political implications or interrogating the forces that prompted the idea of curating context to slowly become a form of knowledge., NR: 1538, Book ID: A Philosophy of Curating, Processed Text: lead repetit form repetit audac invent moment action thu becom legitim accept form practic also concern suppos methodologist contextu becom could continu way quickli becom practic without examin ethic polit implic forc idea context slowli becom form knowledg
TEXT:  Maybe it is not worth looking at curating context as if it were an already established practice or a form of knowledge-production. Instead, I might aim to examine it in the moment of its formulation. To think it through as a mode of inhabiting the immediate environment for which we are responsible, as a mode of being with context., NR: 1539, Book ID: A Philosophy of Curating, Processed Text: mayb worth look context alreadi establish practic form knowledg product instead might aim examin moment formul think mode immedi environ respons mode context
TEXT:  This includes not only material elements and immaterial knowledge, but also everyone implicated in that context, and the pursuant forms of relations and shared narratives. Jean-Luc Nancy writes that: Praxis is the endless transformation of the subject of a sense in itself: a sense that it is nothing other than its communication – and by the same token, its concealment., NR: 1540, Book ID: A Philosophy of Curating, Processed Text: materi element immateri knowledg also everyon context pursuant form relat narr jean nanci praxi endless transform subject sens sens noth commun token conceal
TEXT:  The concealment of thinking is its praxis: thinking then undoes its object in order to become the thinking that is: we, with one another and with the world.4 Considering this statement, maybe we should then see no division between renovating a building, teaching, making an artwork, cleaning the floor, establishing an art institution or making a political statement., NR: 1541, Book ID: A Philosophy of Curating, Processed Text: conceal think praxi think object order becom think one anoth world consid statement mayb see divis build teach make clean floor art institut make polit statement
TEXT:  All material and immaterial labour, including monotonous works and impulsive actions, become one and contribute to the taking of a stance within a given condition.

TEXT:  The question is how such works and actions become operational for the recognition and activation of context. This, I posit, is foundational for formulating the term ‘curating context’. Such an understanding of different levels and forms of curatorial responsibility seems to be attuned with Paolo Virno’s opinion that The customary frontiers separating Intellect, Work, and Action (or, if you prefer, theory, poiesis, and praxis) have given way, and everywhere we see the signs of incursions and crossovers., NR: 1543, Book ID: A Philosophy of Curating, Processed Text: question work action becom oper recognit activ context posit foundat term context understand differ level form curatori respons paolo opinion customari frontier separ intellect work action prefer theori praxi given way everywher see sign incurs crossov
TEXT: 5 This contextual activity includes numerous practical demands which, at the level of curating, not only influence curatorial positions and decisions but also reveal and make active its invisible, unpredictable and uncontrollable elements., NR: 1544, Book ID: A Philosophy of Curating, Processed Text: contextu activ numer practic demand level influenc curatori posit decis also reveal make activ invis unpredict uncontrol element
TEXT:  This leads me towards the supposition that perhaps we are not curating ‘in-context’ but rather we ‘curate context’ as such. In so doing, we are not only addressing artworks, these same artworks also become the means of arriving at meaning., NR: 1545, Book ID: A Philosophy of Curating, Processed Text: lead toward supposit perhap context rather curat context also becom mean mean
TEXT:  Granted, we do not fully control what one can learn from curating context. First, the context can also be activated by something else, thus forcing us to admit that we are not in complete control. Second, the attention of the users of context – never singular – can also point at a ‘meaning’ that simply had slipped through our fingers, as if it had never been there., NR: 1546, Book ID: A Philosophy of Curating, Processed Text: fulli control one learn context first context also someth els thu forc admit complet control second attent user context never singular also point mean simpli slip finger never
TEXT: 6 Thinking through this contextual activity, I am not intending to set a catalogue of rules and recipes for ‘contextual curating’, one that would immediately become a methodological fossil. There is no attempt here to discipline curating context but to turn our attention to the ungraspable and ambiguous, to eventful moments and to all these slippages that escape our lucid categorizations and leave us always in want for more., NR: 1547, Book ID: A Philosophy of Curating, Processed Text: think contextu activ intend set catalogu rule recip contextu one would immedi becom methodolog fossil attempt disciplin context turn attent ungrasp ambigu event moment slippag escap lucid categor leav alway want
TEXT:  I am trying instead to incorporate a diverse set of elements in order to implicate curatorial practices – a practice which is here understood to encompass not only exhibition-making, but also the working of different forms of social relations, incepting, conceptualizing and launching art institutions, fighting financial limits, struggling with the materiality of a site, taking political stances, voicing discontent and all their accompanying burdens and pressures., NR: 1548, Book ID: A Philosophy of Curating, Processed Text: tri instead incorpor divers set element order implic curatori practic practic understood encompass exhibit make also work differ form social relat art institut fight financi limit struggl materi site take polit stanc voic discont burden pressur
TEXT:  Curating context might be an attempt to theorize a form of curatorial practice in the visual arts, understood not only as the task of curating displays that use artworks to narrate or expose context, but as a way of engaging them and ourselves in an inquiry into the specifics of context and its meaning., NR: 1549, Book ID: A Philosophy of Curating, Processed Text: context might attempt theoriz form curatori practic visual art understood task display use narrat expos context way engag inquiri specif context mean
TEXT:  This means to be under the influence and even oppression of context. I am interested in what we can learn from these forms of engagement that are not positioned in praise of or in homage to context.

TEXT:  It includes not only what appears as a dominant or overarching visual narrative, but also what does not fit, what is unwanted, troublesome, awkward and impossible to theorize. Sometimes, context also incorporates and simultaneously obscures autobiographical details in a colourful sub-set of stories made up of personal motivations, difficulties and relations that are invisible but nonetheless operational in one’s practice., NR: 1551, Book ID: A Philosophy of Curating, Processed Text: domin visual narr also doe fit unwant troublesom awkward imposs theoriz sometim context also simultan detail sub set stori made person motiv difficulti relat invis nonetheless oper one practic
TEXT:  In a way, it adds a hidden context that is not habitable by those who engage with contextual curating, but remains nonetheless a clandestine influence on curating context.7 Grappling with materials of which I am an inseparable part sets up a pivotal question, or a series of questions: How am I to speak about a context that I am inextricably a part of? Am I not also an active agent of contextual relations before being an individual on a stage? By throwing myself into the local how exactly do I become a part of it? Through what means can I begin to arrive at its meaning? How can I insert things, actions and ideas into a context that I recognize in order to make it active? How can I operate in order not to instantiate meaning, but make it happen? Curating context is a proposal that sets questions in regard to space and time., NR: 1552, Book ID: A Philosophy of Curating, Processed Text: way add hidden context habit engag contextu remain nonetheless clandestin influenc context grappl materi insepar part set pivot question seri question speak context inextric part also activ agent contextu relat individu stage throw local exactli becom part mean begin arriv mean insert thing action idea context recogn order make activ oper order mean make happen context propos set question regard space time
TEXT:  It is not just a particular location, economic, social or political condition or a local narrative, it also includes layers of historic formations that are connected to it. Henri Lefebvre addresses this social space as a ‘writing tablet’ of history: The uncertain traces left by events are not only the marks on (or in) space: society in its actuality also deposits its script, the result and product of social activities., NR: 1553, Book ID: A Philosophy of Curating, Processed Text: particular locat econom social polit condit local narr also layer histor format connect address social space write tablet histori uncertain trace left event mark space societi actual also deposit script result product social activ
TEXT:  Time has more than one writing-system.

TEXT: 8 This attempt takes place at a moment when we are coming to understand that something has happened to the ways in which curatorial activity contributes to knowledge production today. As ‘curating’ is swiftly growing to be understood as the problematics of staging exhibitions, a subject of study, a profession, an appealing career choice, as well as a contemporary model of public intellectual, it is also becoming ever more urgent to ask what the curatorial is and what it does., NR: 1555, Book ID: A Philosophy of Curating, Processed Text: attempt take place moment come understand someth ha way curatori activ knowledg product today grow understood stage exhibit subject studi profess appeal career choic well contemporari model public intellectu also becom ever urgent ask curatori doe
TEXT:  The curatorial, as formulated by Jean-Paul Martinon, is not exhibition-making, a curatorial practice or curating as such. The curatorial is the event of knowledge that is made possible by the curator both intentionally and unintentionally at a particular moment in space and time., NR: 1556, Book ID: A Philosophy of Curating, Processed Text: curatori jean exhibit make curatori practic curatori event knowledg made possibl curat intent unintent particular moment space time
TEXT: 9 It has relational/interactive features and focuses not on the ‘end product’ (the exhibition, conference or publication) but rather on the performative implications of such an enterprise.

TEXT:  Traces of thinking towards the curatorial can be found in a text from the mid-1990s, expressed using a different vocabulary but with a similarly intended meaning. Ine Gevers in ‘Curating: the Art of Creating Contexts’ closely approaches our notion of the curatorial, although she continues to use the term ‘curating’., NR: 1558, Book ID: A Philosophy of Curating, Processed Text: trace think toward curatori found text mid express differ vocabulari similarli intend mean art context close approach notion curatori although use term
TEXT:  Gevers understands that: Curating is a practice that permits the creation of different interpretative contexts, embracing different political, social and psychological positions, theories and ideologies, at the same time as making critical connections between them., NR: 1559, Book ID: A Philosophy of Curating, Processed Text: practic permit creation differ interpret context embrac differ polit social psycholog posit theori ideolog time make critic connect
TEXT:  To put it more simply, it is about opening up ‘spaces’, within which different discourses can be brought into relationship with one another, ‘spaces of transformation’ in which both critical and self-critical engagement are put into work as the chief transforming agents., NR: 1560, Book ID: A Philosophy of Curating, Processed Text: put simpli open space within differ discours brought relationship one anoth space transform critic self critic engag put work chief transform agent
TEXT:  Such ‘spaces’ would bring personal strategies into the public domain in a way that encourages an arena of inter-subjectivity. These imaginary contexts, then, would have to engage with the discourse of the viewer/respondent on the level of the aesthetic, the ethical and the cognitive and would have to place emphasis not so much on the ‘autonomous’ objects or works of art but on the signifying process offered by the context as a whole and the transformation worked by all of its component agencies acting together., NR: 1561, Book ID: A Philosophy of Curating, Processed Text: space would bring person strategi public domain way arena inter subject imaginari context would engag discours viewer respond level aesthet ethic cognit would place emphasi much autonom object work art process context whole transform work compon agenc act togeth
TEXT: 10 Gevers does not, however, elaborate on the eventful or affectual potential of the curatorial and omits the fact that what it makes possible is not just a single address towards the public, but a more complex form of implication that also includes those who cause the process or who seem to remain peripheral to it in a relational and reciprocal manner., NR: 1562, Book ID: A Philosophy of Curating, Processed Text: doe howev elabor event potenti curatori fact make possibl singl address toward public complex form implic also caus process seem remain peripher relat reciproc manner
TEXT: 11 In addition, one could say that what she means by creating contexts is the stimulation of intertextual relations.

TEXT:  We can thus curate it in a sense that we insert our selves, things or stories in order to activate it. But what Gevers contributes to the discussion is a call for making active the relations between things, thoughts, subjects and spaces going beyond the staging of research on art or presenting artworks., NR: 1564, Book ID: A Philosophy of Curating, Processed Text: thu curat sens insert self thing stori order activ discuss call make activ relat thing thought subject space go beyond stage research art
TEXT:  The way she addresses the opening ‘spaces’ that subsequently can become an ‘arena of inter-subjectivity’ sets the ground for what I would call curating context as a moment of sharing understanding.

TEXT:  In considering curating context with regard to the curatorial, it is essential to find out how we can productively engage with the context – be it a narrative, locality or material residue – an activity often seen as a kind of idealistic agenda in unimportant places., NR: 1566, Book ID: A Philosophy of Curating, Processed Text: consid context regard curatori essenti find product engag context narr local materi residu activ often seen kind idealist agenda unimport place
TEXT:  We must ask ourselves: How can the context be not only identified, unearthed or singled out but also made active without being reduced to just an exposure of local histories or an exotics of particularity? How can the local become a membrane that resonates new possibilities? How can we enter a situation and inhabit the erratic nature of its context? How can we deal with the troubling dimension of the fact that ‘feelings are always local’?12 How we can we affect and be affected by the scattered calcifications of narratives and counter-narratives, fictions, falsifications, failed economies, lost relations and physical damages? The layers of factual information, illustration and interpretation included in the context all fuse with the emotional affect and the texture of its encounter., NR: 1567, Book ID: A Philosophy of Curating, Processed Text: must ask context unearth singl also made activ without reduc exposur local histori particular local becom membran new possibl enter situat inhabit errat natur context deal troubl dimens fact feel alway local affect affect scatter calcif narr counter narr fiction falsif economi lost relat physic damag layer factual inform illustr interpret includ context fuse emot affect textur encount

TEXT: 13 Context includes not only ‘what is there’ but also our ability to recognize it, so it is dependent upon the relational potential of this encounter.

TEXT:  In this way, making an exhibition establishes both the context (an interpretative one) and its intertextual relations.

TEXT:  Context is something that we tend to perceive as a frame but in fact, context is not fixed; its edges are blurred, its texture rich and folded.

TEXT:  Context is a reservoir of knowledge that only comes to the fore with a curatorial practice. Concomitantly, practice is a reaction to the visible and invisible specificity of the surroundings and occurs as a mode of inhabitation, making the context (whether we belong to it or not) vibrant and active., NR: 1572, Book ID: A Philosophy of Curating, Processed Text: context reservoir knowledg come fore curatori practic concomitantli practic reaction visibl invis specif surround mode inhabit make context whether belong vibrant activ

TEXT:  Both Latour and Yaneva are concerned with materiality, processuality and with a certain critique of the objectual (and therefore conventional knowledge linearity). Their thinking asks us to consider a critical approach to the hidden processes taking place in exhibitions, which, to summarize, can be named the ‘processual production of objects’, or ‘the process of staging objects’., NR: 1613, Book ID: A Philosophy of Curating, Processed Text: concern materi certain critiqu therefor convent knowledg linear think consid critic approach hidden process take place exhibit summar processu product object process stage object
TEXT:  If the production of objects is not a thin but a thick reality, as Latour proposes, then objects perform diverse networks that actively assemble other actors and networks. Latour invites us to think of a horizontal interconnected network of agents and actions, as in science laboratories or in technical constructions, which Yaneva explores in Actor-Network Theory as a detailed ethnographic approach to the making of an art installation., NR: 1614, Book ID: A Philosophy of Curating, Processed Text: product object thin thick realiti object perform divers network activ assembl actor network invit think horizont network agent action scienc laboratori technic construct actor network theori detail ethnograph approach make art instal

TEXT:  (. . .) ‘Museum’ is here understood as a quasi-technical network involved in art fabrication work: it is both an installation site and an installation setting.12 Addressing the exhibition from its reverse perspective (not from the audience or from its conceptual premise) and from the perspective of its construction, its contingencies and other interrelations, Yaneva’s field report opens a space between the strictly conceptual and processual nature of production, and the more rigid notion of a structure behind the formal curatorial plan and the institutional frame of the museum., NR: 1617, Book ID: A Philosophy of Curating, Processed Text: museum understood quasi technic network involv art fabric work instal site instal set exhibit revers perspect audienc conceptu premis perspect construct conting interrel field report open space strictli conceptu processu natur product rigid notion structur behind formal curatori plan institut frame museum
TEXT:  Tracing the entrance of a bus from the street and through the meticulous technical phases in which a heterogeneous team ‘turns’ this bus into an art installation in a museum gallery, Yaneva states: Following the actors through the object’s tribulations, one can expose the materialization of all these successive installation operations, and show the appearance of a whole collective acting in the space., NR: 1618, Book ID: A Philosophy of Curating, Processed Text: trace entranc bu street meticul technic phase heterogen team turn bu art instal museum galleri state follow actor object tribul one expos materi success instal oper show appear whole collect act space
TEXT:  (. . .) Instead of being situated in a single artistic mind, in the imagination of a genius, the artistic process is instead seen as distributed within this visible collective.13 The stabilization of the object in a ‘stage’ is a long processual path in which the object is nothing but stable and whose definition is shared by a set of agents and actions., NR: 1619, Book ID: A Philosophy of Curating, Processed Text: instead situat singl artist mind imagin geniu artist process instead seen distribut within visibl collect stabil object stage long processu path object noth stabl whose definit set agent action
TEXT:  Focusing on the set-up of an art installation brings two very productive notions that help us to expand our thinking: the first is the set-up as a process of becoming art; the second is production as performing the unstable state of the art object., NR: 1620, Book ID: A Philosophy of Curating, Processed Text: set art instal two product notion help expand think first set process becom art second product unstabl state art object
TEXT:  Both emerge from a thorough description of the materiality, technicality of the processes of making, including its incidents and its daily human dimension. The process of becoming art is a notion that refers to the relations which are human, material and technical in exhibition-making, articulating art installation as a collective and heteroclite activity: A small collective is formed in the situation or moment (., NR: 1621, Book ID: A Philosophy of Curating, Processed Text: emerg thorough descript materi technic process make incid daili human dimens process becom art notion relat human materi technic exhibit make art instal collect heteroclit activ small collect form situat moment

TEXT:  The unstable state is therefore not possible to define or clarify, it can only be described in its many performances: To analyze the bus’s displacements on the platform, the cleaning procedures and the small temporary events in the Dufy hall, I tried to show the numerous series of infinitely small repetitions of elements and movements, deployed in the uncertainty of art production., NR: 1625, Book ID: A Philosophy of Curating, Processed Text: unstabl state therefor possibl defin clarifi mani perform analyz bu displac platform clean procedur small temporari event hall tri show numer seri infinit small repetit element movement uncertainti art product

TEXT:  Undoing the material reduction of objects to its technical representations is one of the central questions in Latour’s short, but brilliantly titled essay, ‘Can We Get Our Materialism Back, Please?’: For any piece of machinery, to be drawn to specs by an engineer, on one hand, or to remain functional without rusting and rotting away, on the other, requires us to accept two very different types of existence., NR: 1629, Book ID: A Philosophy of Curating, Processed Text: undo materi reduct object technic represent one central question short brilliantli titl essay get materi back pleas piec machineri drawn spec engin one hand remain function without rot away accept two differ type exist

TEXT:  Obvious? Yes, of course – but then why do we so often act as if matter itself were made of parts that behave just like those of technical drawings, which live on indefinitely in a timeless, unchanging realm of geometry?17 Latour’s materialism is more than just parts, pieces and bits technically assembled together as objects., NR: 1631, Book ID: A Philosophy of Curating, Processed Text: obviou ye cours often act matter made part behav like technic draw live indefinit timeless unchang realm geometri materi part piec bit technic togeth object

TEXT:  The fundamental passage in Latour’s call for materialism touches upon two notions that are familiar to curatorial endeavours, the act of enframing, as an act of depicting an image by freezing its limits, and the more abstract notion of opacity, which has been referred by Nina Montmann when proposing a critical revision of institution making in contemporary art, by avocating the right to be opaque as a mode to generate space for experimentation within institutions., NR: 1634, Book ID: A Philosophy of Curating, Processed Text: fundament passag call materi touch upon two notion familiar curatori act act imag freez limit abstract notion opac ha critic revis institut make contemporari art right opaqu mode gener space experiment within institut
TEXT: 18 They act antagonistically, one freezing objects, the second potentiating processes, bridging more closely the question of material materialism. What Latour calls enframing, is a question initiating bridges to the terrain of curatorial studies: What is so promising about extricating material materialism from its idealist counterpart – of which the concept of ‘enframing’ is a typical example – is that it accounts for the surprise and opacity that are so typical of techniques-as-things and that techniques-as-objects, drawn in the res extensa mode, completely hide., NR: 1635, Book ID: A Philosophy of Curating, Processed Text: act one freez object second process bridg close question materi materi call question bridg terrain curatori studi promis materi materi idealist counterpart concept typic exampl account surpris opac typic techniqu thing techniqu object drawn mode complet hide
TEXT:  The exploded-view principle of description makes it possible to overcome one of the main aspects of bringing an artifact into existence: opacity. In other words, it draws the object as if it were open to inspection and mastery while it hides the elementary mode of existence of technical artifacts – to take up Gilbert Simondon’s title., NR: 1636, Book ID: A Philosophy of Curating, Processed Text: explod view principl descript make possibl overcom one main aspect artifact exist opac word draw object open inspect masteri hide elementari mode exist technic artifact take gilbert titl
TEXT: 19 The call for material materialism introduces a certain negation (or resistance) of a technical thing to be fully exposed, keeping experimentation/contingency within its very opacity. Somehow, materialism is opaque, hides a ‘secret’ (as in Derrida), and is performed and conjunctive, proceeding as a thing (as in Heiddeger), and not as pure bits and pieces of abstract matter., NR: 1637, Book ID: A Philosophy of Curating, Processed Text: call materi materi certain negat resist technic thing fulli expos keep experiment conting within opac somehow materi opaqu hide secret conjunct proceed thing pure bit piec abstract matter

TEXT: 27 This Is Not About Us Je Yun Moon This is not about us, the curators.

TEXT:  It is simply tedious to discuss the rise of the new positionality of curators in the art world as a new form of authority or as a new powerful type of agent.

TEXT:  What is so special about one position of hegemony replacing another? This endless identificatory drive to define who or what a curator is owes a great debt to the modern subject machine that has hyperbolically produced self-sufficient, independent individuals as a basic unit for a holistic picture of the world., NR: 1674, Book ID: A Philosophy of Curating, Processed Text: special one posit hegemoni anoth endless drive defin curat great debt modern subject machin ha hyperbol produc self suffici independ individu basic unit holist pictur world
TEXT:  Instead, this is about what happens between us, the curators, in the most expanded sense of the word. If one leaves behind the master narrative of Live in Your [own] Head proposed by a hetero-normative privileged white male subject, one then finds the possibility of opening up a new understanding of the ontological ground for the curator-subject and its relation to the other., NR: 1675, Book ID: A Philosophy of Curating, Processed Text: instead curat expand sens word one leaf behind master narr live head hetero norm privileg white male subject one find possibl open new understand ontolog ground curat subject relat
TEXT: 1 Yes, I am talking here about the driving term that immediately calls for a different space of reflection from that of the curator, one which, so far, has unsatisfactorily been articulated as ‘the curatorial’., NR: 1676, Book ID: A Philosophy of Curating, Processed Text: ye talk drive term immedi call differ space reflect curat one far ha articul curatori
TEXT:  What has to be emphasized here is the fact that the word ‘curatorial’ is not an adjective that describes the mode of operation of professional curators. In other words, the curator is not the first to exist and then the curatorial happens to be its mode of operation., NR: 1677, Book ID: A Philosophy of Curating, Processed Text: ha fact word curatori adject mode oper profession curat word curat first exist curatori mode oper
TEXT:  The term ‘curatorial’ no longer dictates a specific role or position. It is a driving word through which we can begin to negotiate with the imperatives of the modern subject machine. What I am interested in is the performative aspect of the word ‘curatorial’ and what its utterance does to the existing identificatory machine that endlessly consumes us., NR: 1678, Book ID: A Philosophy of Curating, Processed Text: term curatori longer dictat specif role posit drive word begin negoti imper modern subject machin interest perform aspect word curatori utter doe machin endlessli
TEXT:  By shifting the discursive space from curator to curatorial, what opens up here is a new mode of operation that is detached from what I would call the assembly-line model: self-sufficient professional individuals gathering together and contributing to each other’s output, with these outputs accumulating, one on top of another, thus making up the final work: an exhibition., NR: 1679, Book ID: A Philosophy of Curating, Processed Text: shift discurs space curat curatori open new mode oper detach would call assembl line model self suffici profession individu gather togeth output output one top anoth thu make final work exhibit
TEXT:  Once we detach ourselves from the assembly-line model by uttering the word ‘curatorial’, what becomes available is what I would like to articulate as a ‘choreographic mode of operation’. In the same way that the curatorial is not about the mode of operation of professional curators, the choreographic mode of operation is not necessarily about the mode of operation of professional choreographers., NR: 1680, Book ID: A Philosophy of Curating, Processed Text: detach assembl line model word curatori becom avail would like articul choreograph mode oper way curatori mode oper profession curat choreograph mode oper necessarili mode oper profession choreograph
TEXT:  Of course, this does not mean that a choreographic mode of operation cannot be found in contemporary choreographic practices. It does. But what I would like to put forward here is that overall, a choreographic mode of operation opens up a new relation with the identificatory drive of the modern subject machine., NR: 1681, Book ID: A Philosophy of Curating, Processed Text: cours doe mean choreograph mode oper cannot found contemporari choreograph practic doe would like put forward overal choreograph mode oper open new relat drive modern subject machin
TEXT:  How is this possible? From its very beginning, choreography has been the act of writing one’s movements onto somebody else’s body.2 In this way of articulating choreography, two distinctive meanings are put together: to write one’s movements and the body of the other., NR: 1682, Book ID: A Philosophy of Curating, Processed Text: possibl begin choreographi ha act write one movement onto somebodi els bodi way choreographi two distinct mean put togeth write one movement bodi
TEXT:  Yet there is no natural transference between writing one’s movements and the body of the other. But the very engineering of putting them together is what allows choreography to develop a specific relation with a modern subject machine in Western history., NR: 1683, Book ID: A Philosophy of Curating, Processed Text: yet natur transfer write one movement bodi engin togeth choreographi develop specif relat modern subject machin western histori
TEXT:  The very first moment when a discussion on the need to invent this new technology, later called choreography in the history of the West, can be found in the dialogue between a Jesuit priest/dance master, Thoinot Arbeau, and the lawyer Capriol, in Orchésographie (1589), which André Lepecki introduces in his book, Exhausting Dance., NR: 1684, Book ID: A Philosophy of Curating, Processed Text: first moment discuss need invent new technolog later choreographi histori west found dialogu priest danc master lawyer book exhaust danc
TEXT: 3 The conversation was triggered by the young lawyer when he pleaded to his master to set his movements down in writing after he realized that the art of dance was vulnerable to the passage of time. Here, writing should not be understood as being subordinate to logocentrism., NR: 1685, Book ID: A Philosophy of Curating, Processed Text: convers wa trigger young lawyer master set movement write art danc wa vulner passag time write understood subordin
TEXT:  In other words, writing is not just a representative device, that is inferior to the actual movements of the master. Instead, the technology of writing is deployed in order to inscribe the movements against the passage of time., NR: 1686, Book ID: A Philosophy of Curating, Processed Text: word write repres devic inferior actual movement master instead technolog write order inscrib movement passag time
TEXT:  In other words, writing was what captured the subjectivity of the master in order to repeat its performance and thus preserve it beyond his death. Thanks to this new technology, the movements of the dead master find a way of always being present., NR: 1687, Book ID: A Philosophy of Curating, Processed Text: word write wa subject master order repeat perform thu preserv beyond death thank new technolog movement dead master find way alway present
TEXT:  This presence not only manifests itself when the student socializes among themselves, but also as the companions of his own youth reunite together to celebrate his memory.4 By allowing the transcendental presence of the subject to remain in this way in play, choreography – which later manifested itself as a heterogeneous set of power relations in the development of Western modernity – thus plays an active part in the construction of the modern subject machine., NR: 1688, Book ID: A Philosophy of Curating, Processed Text: presenc manifest student among also companion youth reunit togeth celebr memori transcendent presenc subject remain way play choreographi later manifest heterogen set power relat develop western modern thu play activ part construct modern subject machin
TEXT:  Yet, this transcendental subject always writes one’s movements for the body of the other (including one’s own youth), from the very first moment of its inception (this is not necessarily emancipatory)., NR: 1689, Book ID: A Philosophy of Curating, Processed Text: yet transcendent subject alway one movement bodi one youth first moment incept necessarili emancipatori
TEXT:  This is why the choreographic ‘I’ is perceived only as providing a ‘space of appearance’ for the other, borrowing Hannah Arendt’s words.5 This does not change in a situation where one is choreographing for oneself., NR: 1690, Book ID: A Philosophy of Curating, Processed Text: choreograph provid space appear borrow word doe chang situat one oneself
TEXT:  This is the very spot that enables contemporary choreographic experiments to develop a new relation with the modern subject machine, different from the assembly-line model. Against this backdrop, it is fascinating to witness how contemporary choreographic experiments have performed the choreographic mode of operation that opens up a new space for reflection by continuously negotiating with the conditions of possibility inherent in the notion of choreography., NR: 1691, Book ID: A Philosophy of Curating, Processed Text: spot contemporari choreograph experi develop new relat modern subject machin differ assembl line model backdrop fascin wit contemporari choreograph experi choreograph mode oper open new space reflect continu condit possibl inher notion choreographi
TEXT:  Here, I am thinking of the proposals made by choreographers such as Brois Charmatz, Jérôme Bel, Jan Ritsema, Christine de Smedt, Eszter Salamon, Xavier Le Roy and Jonathan Burrows, to name but a few. Although it is not possible to bracket them under one umbrella, it is however not difficult to find convergences and interrelationships between their practices., NR: 1692, Book ID: A Philosophy of Curating, Processed Text: think propos made choreograph bel burrow name although possibl bracket one umbrella howev difficult find converg practic
TEXT:  One of the most evident examples of convergence is a recognition of the possibilities inherent in the notion of choreography, as a powerful drive to open up different understandings of the subject, a way of structuring the subject by writing for somebody else’s body., NR: 1693, Book ID: A Philosophy of Curating, Processed Text: one evid exampl converg recognit possibl inher notion choreographi power drive open differ understand subject way subject write somebodi els bodi
TEXT:  In doing so, this group of choreographers begins to use choreography for projects that are entirely different from their historical precedents in theatrical dance. What seems crucial to me in their operation is the fact these choreographers never stop playing with the limits inherent in the notion of choreography., NR: 1694, Book ID: A Philosophy of Curating, Processed Text: group choreograph begin use choreographi project entir differ histor preced theatric danc crucial oper fact choreograph never stop limit inher notion choreographi
TEXT:  They are not only flipping around and turning upside down the sets of conditions that allow the subject to write for somebody else’s body, they also endlessly bring back the voice of the master without repeating it., NR: 1695, Book ID: A Philosophy of Curating, Processed Text: around turn upsid set condit allow subject write somebodi els bodi also endlessli bring back voic master without
TEXT:  In doing so, they turn the existing limits of conventional choreographic practices into the very material that will allow them to set up what I call ‘epistemological games’. What I mean here by an epistemological game is the playful work of keeping ‘questionability’ alive in order to continuously negotiate with the conditions of possibility that have been helplessly circumscribed within the modern subject machine., NR: 1696, Book ID: A Philosophy of Curating, Processed Text: turn limit convent choreograph practic materi allow set call epistemolog game mean epistemolog game play work keep question aliv order continu negoti condit possibl helplessli circumscrib within modern subject machin
TEXT: 6 This is why the epistemological games set up by this group of choreographers should really be recognized not only as distinctive from those of the revolutionary impulse, but also as transgressive as the spirits of the historical avant-garde under its Hegelian dichotomy., NR: 1697, Book ID: A Philosophy of Curating, Processed Text: epistemolog game set group choreograph realli distinct revolutionari impuls also transgress spirit histor dichotomi
TEXT:  Overall, their epistemological games have contributed to a rethinking of how one forms a relationship with the never-ending modern subject machine, and this without denying its everlasting operation. Their epistemological games never attempt to ‘molecularize’ the subject into a ‘physic-aesthetic model’., NR: 1698, Book ID: A Philosophy of Curating, Processed Text: overal epistemolog game one form relationship never end modern subject machin without everlast oper epistemolog game never attempt subject physic aesthet model
TEXT: 7 Instead, they create a game between the ‘molar’ subjects in order to continuously negotiate with the conditions of possibility. Yet, this choreographic mode of operation clearly differs from the operation of networking, as it is not about promoting exchanges or multiple encounters based on self-sufficient subjects., NR: 1699, Book ID: A Philosophy of Curating, Processed Text: instead creat game molar subject order continu negoti condit possibl yet choreograph mode oper clearli oper exchang multipl encount base self suffici subject
TEXT:  With regard to the curatorial, the epistemological games that are set up by contemporary choreographic experiments in relation to the discipline of choreography allows the creation of a distance between the practice of curating and the curatorial mode of operation., NR: 1700, Book ID: A Philosophy of Curating, Processed Text: regard curatori epistemolog game set contemporari choreograph experi relat disciplin choreographi creation distanc practic curatori mode oper
TEXT:  Again, thinking about the curatorial through choreography has nothing to do with the notion of an expanded field of practice that resembles a melting pot of practices and ideologies. The choreographic mode of operation challenges or disturbs the very ground on which the notion of the curator-subject is safely based and with which it harmoniously maintains its relationship with other disciplines., NR: 1701, Book ID: A Philosophy of Curating, Processed Text: think curatori choreographi ha noth notion expand field practic melt pot practic ideolog choreograph mode oper challeng ground notion curat subject safe base harmoni relationship disciplin
TEXT:  Rethinking the curatorial through a choreographic mode of operation thus allows us to open up a different episteme for curatorial practice.

TEXT:  It is always, already, a way of writing for somebody else’s body in the most expanded sense of the word.

TEXT:  Curating may well have its famous personalities and its attempt at a canonical history but there’s still something essentially secondary about it . . . or maybe it’s better to say that it has aspirations to philosophical or aesthetic coherence but is so often compromised by the expectations of patrons and bureaucracies that the agency of the curatorial is rarely fully deployed., NR: 1711, Book ID: A Philosophy of Curating, Processed Text: may well famou person attempt canon histori still someth essenti secondari mayb better say ha aspir philosoph aesthet coher often expect patron bureaucraci agenc curatori rare fulli
TEXT:  Of course, this situation is largely true of the artistic act as well.

TEXT:  While the Cold War settlement took almost 20 years to decay, after 1989 there was no more ideological reason to fund arts as a manifestation of Western freedom and gradually other motivations – urban improvement, tourism, social inclusion, education – emerged from governments to make it clear that public money came with official expectations., NR: 1714, Book ID: A Philosophy of Curating, Processed Text: cold war settlement took almost year decay wa ideolog reason fund art manifest western freedom gradual motiv urban improv tourism social inclus educ govern make clear public money came offici expect
TEXT:  More recently, particularly in states such as the Netherlands, these arguments are being abandoned as culture is seen as of value only to private interest and patronage. These shifts in financial dependence coincided with the emergence of the freelance, authorial curator as a figure that could negotiate between artistic practices and the bureaucrats or oligarchs who needed to be able to show outputs and outcomes in order to hand over their cash., NR: 1715, Book ID: A Philosophy of Curating, Processed Text: recent particularli state argument abandon cultur seen valu privat interest patronag shift financi depend emerg authori curat figur could negoti artist practic bureaucrat oligarch abl show output outcom order hand cash

TEXT:  Instead it seems more than rational to expect that money, power and organization will express their own agenda when they come to support the artistic act. However, the analysis I have provided does require careful consideration of the compromised nature of the curatorial as an activity embedded within a system and an analysis of the relative quality of its agency as it is exercised on each individual occasion., NR: 1718, Book ID: A Philosophy of Curating, Processed Text: instead ration expect money power organ express agenda come support artist act howev analysi provid doe requir care consider natur curatori activ within system analysi rel qualiti agenc individu occas

TEXT:  To perform at all, the curatorial as an activity and a discourse must establish certain clear protocols through which it can communicate. The public exhibition is obviously one, but seminars, congresses, marathons, caucuses, masterclasses and other more or less intensive public moments have gained currency as ways of displaying the curatorial in less fixed settings., NR: 1720, Book ID: A Philosophy of Curating, Processed Text: perform curatori activ discours must establish certain clear protocol commun public exhibit obvious one seminar congress marathon caucu less intens public moment currenc way curatori less fix set
TEXT:  Many of these forms are lifted from other disciplines – if we can call the curatorial a discipline – while one or two are generated from within the practice.

TEXT:  Sadly therefore, these texts are of little use in analysing the balance of negotiation, stubbornness, submissiveness and clear thinking that curating inevitably entails.

TEXT:  It is obvious that producing that surplus is not in the hands of a single agent but is expressed in the collective total of meaning production carried out during, and mostly after, the event itself. It seems that only by revisiting exhibitions after a period and through the eyes of different participants (artists, critics, visitors, funders as well the curators) can some account of the ambition and effectiveness of the curatorial mode of thought and action be made., NR: 1733, Book ID: A Philosophy of Curating, Processed Text: obviou surplu hand singl agent express collect total mean product carri mostli event exhibit period eye differ particip artist critic visitor well curat account ambit effect curatori mode thought action made
