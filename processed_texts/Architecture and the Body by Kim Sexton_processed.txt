TEXT:  On the other hand, in the wake of Descartes’ mechanistic psychology, modern civilization has dissociated feeling, thinking and imagining, postulating them as independent mental processes. This dissociation has been recently questioned by neuroscientist Antonio Damasio (2005), who has demonstrated the crucial importance of feeling for cognitive processes associated with reason: individuals with neurological disorders that exhibit an incapacity to experience emotions are also unable to plan actions in the future., NR: 78, Book ID: Architecture and the Body by Kim Sexton, Processed Text: hand wake mechanist psycholog modern civil ha feel think independ mental process dissoci ha recent ha crucial import feel cognit process associ reason individu neurolog disord exhibit incapac experi emot also unabl plan action futur

Beliefs about the status of the body as an articulated organic whole whose muscles may enact the personal will, and whose entrails reveal the presence of divinities (as in Classical antiquity), as a vehicle of transcendence of our mortal condition (a privileged manifestation of medieval Christian materiality), or as an objectified mechanistic physiological system (after Descartes), actually modify the perceptions of individuals in those particular historical and cultural contexts; they have an impact on both how architecture is conceived and how it is received by its inhabitants., NR: 84, Book ID: Architecture and the Body by Kim Sexton, Processed Text: ha import consequ topic hand belief statu bodi articul organ whole whose muscl may enact person whose entrail reveal presenc divin classic antiqu vehicl transcend mortal condit privileg manifest mediev materi mechanist physiolog system actual modifi percept individu particular histor cultur context impact architectur receiv inhabit

TEXT:  Despite its emphasis on ‘truth as correspondence’, its logos is always open to a reconciliation with mythos, with mythical discourses of different kinds ranging from Classical mythology, to Judeo-Christian stories, magical-hermetic Renaissance and early modern beliefs, and scientific theories driven by theological questions, dominant in Europe as late as the eighteenth century., NR: 87, Book ID: Architecture and the Body by Kim Sexton, Processed Text: despit emphasi truth correspond alway open reconcili mytho mythic discours differ kind rang classic mytholog stori magic hermet renaiss earli modern belief scientif theori driven theolog question domin late eighteenth centuri
TEXT:  Such discourses have differing presuppositions about the nature of reality. In simple terms, one could argue that scientia in its changing incarnations, always accepts dimensions of mythical discourse in order to make sense of reality, a mythical language that only slowly gets expurgated from the orbit of ‘legitimate’ knowledge, after the advent of modernity and most explicitly by ninteenth century positivism., NR: 88, Book ID: Architecture and the Body by Kim Sexton, Processed Text: discours presupposit natur realiti simpl term one could argu incarn alway dimens mythic discours order make sens realiti mythic languag slowli get orbit legitim knowledg modern explicitli centuri positiv

TEXT:  In architectural theories, discourse in this tradition is always present and complementary to scientia.

TEXT:  This is the body in popular aphorisms and eventually in world literature after the birth of the novel in the nineteenth century. Seeking to continue the tradition of practical philosophy in philosophical hermeneutics, Gadamer has suggested that after Kant and the specialization of scientific philosophy brought about by the ‘prolegomena to any future metaphysics’ which banned ‘speculative’ (polysemic, everyday) language from philosophy, the proper site to ask and answer the crucial philosophical questions of mankind is in fact the realm of fiction, the corpus of novels that now contribute their wisdom to the majority of world cultures., NR: 95, Book ID: Architecture and the Body by Kim Sexton, Processed Text: bodi popular aphor eventu world literatur birth novel nineteenth centuri seek continu tradit practic philosophi philosoph hermeneut ha special scientif philosophi brought prolegomenon futur metaphys specul everyday languag philosophi proper site ask answer crucial philosoph question mankind fact realm fiction corpu novel contribut wisdom major world cultur

TEXT:  Our own ‘normal’ (scientific, objective) self-understanding of the body has to be bracketed in order to grasp what may have been at stake in other times and places. In other words, the changing body image matters not only as it contributes to concepts of architecture and potential metaphors (poetic images), but also insofar it affects the way the primary emotional experience becomes manifest in different cultural and historical contexts, this being the primary nature of architectural meaning as a given ‘attuned’ atmosphere framing a particular cultural situation., NR: 97, Book ID: Architecture and the Body by Kim Sexton, Processed Text: normal scientif object self understand bodi ha order grasp may stake time place word bodi imag matter concept architectur potenti metaphor poetic imag also insofar affect way primari emot experi becom manifest differ cultur histor context primari natur architectur mean given atmospher frame particular cultur situat

TEXT:  At times the relationships that emerge between bodies and buildings are rather direct in the eyes of a patron or in the mind and hand of an architect.

TEXT:  The chapters of this volume knit these discourses together in a very specific way.

TEXT:  Such a distinction is obviously not productive for architecture, where construction necessarily goes hand in hand with technological advances as surely as design engages breakthroughs in theory.

TEXT:  But a restricted circle does not mean that the ideas were not derived from widely known scientific discourses or direct experience of what was generally knowable through the body.

TEXT:  Science, too, is obviously historically situated (Pickering, 1992, pp. 1–26; Shapin, 1996). The ways in which science, the body and architecture intersected over the course of two millennia can easily be distorted by boundaries fashioned as recently as the nineteenth century, such as the divide between religion and science or even between the imagination and the sciences (Grant, 2001, pp., NR: 125, Book ID: Architecture and the Body by Kim Sexton, Processed Text: scienc obvious histor situat picker way scienc bodi architectur cours two millennium easili distort boundari fashion recent nineteenth centuri divid religion scienc even imagin scienc grant

TEXT:  Hence, the range of sources in this volume includes texts ranging from Greek poetry to theological tracts as well as medical manuals and architectural historiography. The authors of the modern chapters grapple with the challenges posed by the emergence of ‘objectivity’ in the mid-nineteenth-century sciences (Daston and Galison, 2007), while those who wrote the pre-modern chapters take for granted that clinical objectivity was rarely the goal of science at a time when churches and theaters could serve as laboratories, and when ‘principal investigators’ were philosophers, clerics or artists just as easily as physicians or astronomers., NR: 129, Book ID: Architecture and the Body by Kim Sexton, Processed Text: henc rang sourc volum text rang poetri theolog tract well medic manual architectur historiographi author modern chapter grappl challeng emerg object mid nineteenth centuri scienc wrote modern chapter take clinic object wa rare goal scienc time church theater could serv laboratori princip investig philosoph cleric artist easili physician astronom

TEXT:  The research presented in this volume seeks to normalize such questions to the point that one asks not why, but how science and the body have impacted architectural theory and practice.

TEXT:  For today’s sociological and psychological researchers, the projection of anatomical structure, physiological processes or mental intentions onto objects is far from a ‘mere’ intuitive act. For Pascal Boyer, people entertain anthropomorphic representations as counterfactual speculations so that a thing might be known and experienced contrastively both in likeness and divergence to human attributes (Boyer, 1996, p., NR: 132, Book ID: Architecture and the Body by Kim Sexton, Processed Text: today sociolog psycholog research project anatom structur physiolog process mental intent onto object far mere intuit act boyer peopl entertain anthropomorph represent specul thing might known experienc contrast like diverg human attribut boyer

TEXT: 1 Architecture before the body? Articulation and proportion in Archaic and Classical Greece Lian Chikako Chang When we look into our past, we see some things and not others.

TEXT:  Classical Greek temples, with their rows of columns and frontal entablatures, have lent themselves to endless geometric speculations carried out through diagrams overlaid on reconstructed elevations; and the limbs of Greek figural sculptures have likewise been subjected to the kind of scrutiny that one might have thought reserved for the physiognomic nude ‘posture photos’ of the mid-twentieth century., NR: 172, Book ID: Architecture and the Body by Kim Sexton, Processed Text: classic templ row column frontal entablatur lent endless geometr specul carri diagram overlaid reconstruct elev limb figur sculptur likewis subject kind scrutini one might thought reserv physiognom nude postur photo mid twentieth centuri
TEXT:  No doubt, the ancients crafted their sculptures and temples according to measure. And it is equally clear that they drew an analogy between the measures of parts of the human body and parts of temples: the existence of reliefs describing units of measure through images of feet, hand spans, and arm spans (or cubits) suggests this, as does other evidence from various quarters (Figure 1., NR: 173, Book ID: Architecture and the Body by Kim Sexton, Processed Text: doubt ancient sculptur templ accord measur equal clear drew analog measur part human bodi part templ exist relief unit measur imag foot hand span arm span cubit doe evid variou quarter figur

TEXT:  Despite this breadth of topics, proportion and its basis in the human body are by far the best known of Vitruvian themes. He writes that ‘if a person is imagined lying back with outstretched arms and feet within a circle whose center is at the navel, the fingers and toes will trace the circumference of this circle as they move about’, while the soles of the feet, crown of the head, and outstretched arms also achieve the dimensions of a square (Vitr., NR: 188, Book ID: Architecture and the Body by Kim Sexton, Processed Text: despit breadth topic proport basi human bodi far best known theme person lie back arm foot within circl whose center navel finger toe trace circumfer circl move sol foot crown head arm also achiev dimens squar
TEXT:  De Arch. 3.1.3, trans. 1999). And so, he continues: if Nature has composed the human body so that in its proportions (proportio) the separate individual elements answer to the total form, then the ancients [that is, the Greeks] seem to have had reason to … [require] a correspondence between the measure of individual elements and the appearance of the work as a whole., NR: 189, Book ID: Architecture and the Body by Kim Sexton, Processed Text: arch natur ha compos human bodi proport separ individu element answer total form ancient seem reason requir correspond measur individu element appear work whole

The fact that Leonardo’s famous ink drawing of 1490 depicts his ‘Vitruvian Man’ standing, instead of lying down as in Vitruvius’ text, suggests a subtle but meaningful shift in priorities in the intervening millennium and a half: whereas the ancients saw human kind as an imperfect and passive recasting of a more perfect order, the early moderns began to picture themselves as active in the projection of this order., NR: 190, Book ID: Architecture and the Body by Kim Sexton, Processed Text: arch ha made imag familiar point banal fact famou ink draw man stand instead lie text subtl meaning shift prioriti millennium half wherea ancient saw human kind imperfect passiv recast perfect order earli modern pictur activ project order

Moreover, the urge to render visible what Vitruvius had been content to leave as an image in the mind’s eye reflects the early modern faith in humankind’s ability to see intelligible reality directly., NR: 192, Book ID: Architecture and the Body by Kim Sexton, Processed Text: fra moreov urg render visibl content leav imag mind eye earli modern faith humankind abil see intellig realiti directli
TEXT:  This belief was not shared in antiquity but in modernity became almost tautological: reality is what is seen with one’s eyes.

TEXT:  Here again, Vitruvius’ text has been reinterpreted to suit successive eras: while ‘Vitruvian classicism’ has come to stand for a rigid or prescriptive set of canonical forms, Vitruvius himself frequently reminds his reader that it is the architect’s job to select and adapt the principles of proportion for each specific project (Rowland and Howe, 1999, p., NR: 194, Book ID: Architecture and the Body by Kim Sexton, Processed Text: text ha suit success era classic ha come stand rigid prescript set canon form frequent reader architect job select adapt principl proport specif project howe
TEXT:  15). He gives proportional guidelines not primarily through images, but rather in the form of numerical relationships described in text.

TEXT:  Even a cursory reading of Vitruvius reveals this: his lengthy discussions of climate, drinking water, building materials, and the task of city foundation draw on contemporary understandings of health that go back to the Hippocratics in the fifth century BCE, suggesting the regulation of a different kind of body, as will be seen in Ece Okay’s chapter in this volume., NR: 198, Book ID: Architecture and the Body by Kim Sexton, Processed Text: even cursori read lengthi discuss climat drink water build materi task citi foundat draw contemporari understand health back fifth centuri suggest regul differ kind bodi seen chapter volum
TEXT:  For example, Vitruvius’ discussion of building materials hinges on each material’s relative proportions of elements: He describes stones from Anician quarries north of Rome as having ‘endless virtues’, since ‘neither freezing storms nor the touch of fire can hurt them; they are firm and last to a great old age because they have little air and fire in their natural composition, a moderate amount of water, and a very great deal of earth’ (Vitr., NR: 199, Book ID: Architecture and the Body by Kim Sexton, Processed Text: exampl discuss build materi hing materi rel proport element stone quarri north endless virtu sinc neither freez storm touch fire hurt firm last great old age littl air fire natur composit moder amount water great deal earth
TEXT:  De Arch. 2.7.3, trans. 1999). The qualities endowed upon a material by a given set of proportions also depend on how the material is used. For example, alder ‘would hardly seem to be a useful wood’ because ‘it is composed of a great deal of air and fire, not much earth, and little water’., NR: 200, Book ID: Architecture and the Body by Kim Sexton, Processed Text: arch qualiti upon materi given set proport also depend materi use exampl alder would hardli seem use wood compos great deal air fire much earth littl water
TEXT:  It does not, Vitruvius reports, ‘last for even a short time out of the earth’. But when it is ‘densely fixed as pilings under the foundations of buildings in swampy sites, by absorbing the liquid it lacks by nature it remains undecayed for eternity’ (Vitr., NR: 201, Book ID: Architecture and the Body by Kim Sexton, Processed Text: doe report last even short time earth dens fix pile foundat build swampi site absorb liquid lack natur remain undecay etern
TEXT:  De Arch. 2.9.10, trans. 1999). Proportion, here, is circumstantial. Vitruvius similarly discusses human bodies in terms of the substances they contain, absorb and emit. He is particularly concerned about the design of theaters, because when spectators sit motionless in pleasure in a theater they have, in Vitruvius’ words, ‘wide-open pores, in which the breath of the wind can easily take hold’., NR: 202, Book ID: Architecture and the Body by Kim Sexton, Processed Text: arch proport circumstanti similarli human bodi term substanc contain absorb emit particularli concern design theater spectat sit motionless pleasur theater word wide open pore breath wind easili take hold
TEXT:  This puts people at risk if the theater is sited near ‘unhealthful places’; for example, if winds blow swamp air into the theater, ‘they will pour their harmful vapors into the spectator’s bodies’ (Vitr., NR: 203, Book ID: Architecture and the Body by Kim Sexton, Processed Text: put peopl risk theater near unhealth place exampl wind blow swamp air theater pour harm vapor spectat bodi
TEXT:  De Arch. 5.3.1, trans. 1999). But neither is a ‘direct southern exposure’ healthy. In such a case, ‘the air, enclosed by the theater’s curvature’ gets heated and thus ‘boils off and thus reduces the moisture in the bodies of the spectators’ (Vitr., NR: 204, Book ID: Architecture and the Body by Kim Sexton, Processed Text: arch neither direct southern exposur healthi case air theater curvatur get thu boil thu moistur bodi spectat
TEXT:  De Arch. 5.3.2, trans. 1999). Along the porticoes outside the theater, Vitruvius recommends planting gardens for three reasons: first, ‘because the subtle and light air from green plants flows in as the body exercises and clears the vision, carrying off the dense moisture from the eyes’; second, because such places help a populace with weight loss, as ‘the air, sucking away moisture from the limbs, reduces fullness … dissipating whatever the body has absorbed beyond what it can bear’; and finally, because ‘in open-air places the more noxious humors are sucked out of bodies, just as they seem to be drawn out of the earth on clouds’ (Vitr., NR: 205, Book ID: Architecture and the Body by Kim Sexton, Processed Text: arch along portico outsid theater plant garden three reason first subtl light air green plant flow bodi exercis clear vision carri dens moistur eye second place help populac weight loss air suck away moistur limb full whatev bodi ha absorb beyond bear final open air place noxiou humor bodi seem drawn earth cloud

TEXT:  While Vitruvius’ text is the earliest architectural treatise to have survived, he is not the first to write about these issues.

Why is the same phrase, of the loosening of knees (luō is ‘to loosen’), used to capture these two emotional and decisive, but very different, situations? What does it mean to have one’s knees loosened? And why does Achilles say he has loosened Hector’s knees when the site of his injury is at the clavicle?

TEXT:  16.312, 16.341, 16.400, 16.465). Throughout the Archaic and Classical periods, the nimble and powerful energy associated with guia and other notions of articulation are highly valorized. In fact, the idea of articulation can be found at the origins of the Greek language itself, in the reconstructed Indo-European root *ar- which finds its way into a number of Greek terms with meanings related to joining, binding or fitting together, making, dividing by joints or taking apart, arranging, setting in order, reconciling, pleasing or satisfying, slapping together, dashing to pieces, taking a wife, uniting and so on: harmozō, harmonia, harmos, arthron, arithmios, arthroō, and diarthroō, to name a few., NR: 240, Book ID: Architecture and the Body by Kim Sexton, Processed Text: throughout archaic classic period nimbl power energi associ notion articul highli fact idea articul found origin languag reconstruct root find way number term mean relat join bind fit togeth make divid joint take apart set order reconcil pleas satisfi slap togeth dash piec take wife unit harmonia name

TEXT:  The *ar- root, then, describes a vital, pleasing, or beautiful unification of disparate elements. Words and ideas related to articulation extend beyond the *ar- root. Terms such as haptō, mignumi, amiktos, luō, dialuō, sunechō, suntassō (and many other sun- words, since this prefix means ‘with’ or ‘together’), which are not etymologically derived from *ar-, also enact joining and separating., NR: 242, Book ID: Architecture and the Body by Kim Sexton, Processed Text: root vital pleas beauti unif dispar element word idea relat articul extend beyond root term mani sun word sinc prefix mean togeth etymolog deriv also enact join separ

TEXT:  The verb harmozō can mean to fit together, but also to marry, while diarthroō means to divide by joints, but also to describe distinctly, to endow with articulate speech. The name ‘Homer’, as Gregory Nagy (2001) has argued, may derive from homo-ar or ‘he who joins together’, alluding to the notion that the poet’s work was to arrange and join ready-made lines to create stories and images of dazzling effect (pp., NR: 244, Book ID: Architecture and the Body by Kim Sexton, Processed Text: verb mean fit togeth also marri mean divid joint also describ distinctli endow articul speech name homer ha may deriv homo join togeth notion poet work wa arrang join readi made line creat stori imag effect
TEXT:  89–91). Together, these tangible and intangible forms of articulation begin to sketch a web of meanings that for the Archaic Greeks were both closely related and culturally meaningful.

TEXT:  On the other hand, being too tight is also disabling. In the Iliad, when Andromache hears of her husband Hector’s death, her knees stiffen; she is immobilized with grief (Il. 22.452–53). In Homer, whether the result of death, joyful surprise, grief, fear, fatigue, or even lust, these and other states of incapacitation and immobility are described through the language of disarticulation (Il., NR: 247, Book ID: Architecture and the Body by Kim Sexton, Processed Text: hand tight also husband hector death knee stiffen grief homer whether result death joy surpris grief fear fatigu even lust state incapacit immobl languag disarticul

TEXT:  Strength, beauty, life, mobility, and the blessings of gods, in turn, are described through the language of articulation, at times through architectural analogies. For example, when Odysseus wrestles with Aias – at the auspicious occasion of Patroclus’ funeral games – their strengths are matched in an apparent stalemate for a long time: Then the two … laid hold each of the other in close grip with their mighty hands, even as the rafters (ameibontes) of a high house, which some famous craftsman (tektōn) joined (arariskō) together, that he may have shelter from the might of the winds., NR: 249, Book ID: Architecture and the Body by Kim Sexton, Processed Text: strength beauti life mobil bless god turn languag articul time architectur analog exampl wrestl auspici occas funer game strength appar stalem long time two laid hold close grip mighti hand even rafter high hous famou craftsman togeth may shelter might wind

TEXT:  Hoplite phalanxes are the more formal, Classical counterpart to Achilles’ ranks of men, and they exemplify a construction of a body that is both articulated and proportioned.

TEXT:  In Athens and other city-states the hoplite phalanx was comprised of citizens – not professional soldiers, metics (foreign residents) or slaves – arrayed as equals in straight rows. Male citizens were defined by their role in a phalanx; this was not only a right but also a responsibility, since failure to participate could result in dishonor and disenfranchisement (Hansen, 1999, p., NR: 272, Book ID: Architecture and the Body by Kim Sexton, Processed Text: citi state hoplit phalanx wa compris citizen profession soldier metic foreign resid slave equal straight row male citizen defin role phalanx wa right also respons sinc failur particip could result dishonor

TEXT:  Projectiles, cavalry and sieges were little used. The season for war was typically summer (Lazenby, 1991, p. 88), and battles would often begin and end in a single day. Evidence suggests that the mortality rate was low, with estimates of 2 to 14 per cent for each side, in comparison with estimates of 60 per cent for Roman battles a few centuries later (Lazenby, 1991, p., NR: 276, Book ID: Architecture and the Body by Kim Sexton, Processed Text: projectil cavalri sieg littl use season war wa typic summer battl would often begin end singl day evid mortal rate wa low estim per cent side comparison estim per cent battl centuri later

While it seems ineffectual in martial terms, what the culture of hoplite warfare accomplished, strikingly and radically, was for the civic body of a polis to engage in direct agonistic competition, testing the bonds between its citizens against those of other city-states., NR: 277, Book ID: Architecture and the Body by Kim Sexton, Processed Text: ineffectu martial term cultur hoplit warfar accomplish strikingli radic wa civic bodi poli engag direct agonist competit test bond citizen citi state
TEXT:  Strategy, nonetheless, mattered. Writings about military events reveal that disorder lurked at every turn, as phalanxes often disintegrated out of panic (Lazenby, 1991, p. 104). Even in the absence of all-out panic, order was difficult to maintain: phalanxes tended to drift towards the right as each man sought refuge behind his neighbor’s shield., NR: 278, Book ID: Architecture and the Body by Kim Sexton, Processed Text: strategi nonetheless write militari event reveal disord everi turn phalanx often panic even absenc panic order wa difficult maintain phalanx drift toward right man sought refug behind neighbor shield
TEXT:  With this drift happening on both sides, two opposing phalanxes would often not meet squarely, leaving their left flanks vulnerable while overlapping the enemy on the right.

TEXT:  Indeed, a commander – the Greek word for which, kosmētēs, literally meant ‘one who makes orderly’ – had to determine the necessary length and number of rows of soldiers in advance: records show that phalanxes ranged between eight and fifty rows deep (Lazenby, 1991, pp., NR: 280, Book ID: Architecture and the Body by Kim Sexton, Processed Text: inde command word liter meant one make orderli determin necessari length number row soldier advanc record show phalanx rang eight fifti row deep
TEXT:  89, 98–9). Longer rows facilitated attacks on the opponent’s flank, while a deeper phalanx with more rows was considered better for pushing. Surviving texts on the relative merits of various phalanx arrangements confirm that, in addition to encouraging his men to remain joined in formation, one of the commander’s key responsibilities was to determine the proper proportion with which to order their body of fighters (Lazenby, 1991, p., NR: 281, Book ID: Architecture and the Body by Kim Sexton, Processed Text: longer row attack oppon flank phalanx row wa consid better push surviv text rel merit variou phalanx arrang confirm addit encourag men remain format one command key wa determin proper proport order bodi fighter

TEXT:  Just as Classical Greeks’ discussions of health and war drew on political ideas, their understanding of bodily order and disorder allowed politics to be understood in terms of disease.

TEXT:  The word stasis, meaning ‘factional rivalry’ or ‘internal discord’ had first appeared in the sixth century BCE soon after the formation of the Classical polis, and remained tied to the notion of the polis thereafter., NR: 294, Book ID: Architecture and the Body by Kim Sexton, Processed Text: word stasi mean faction rivalri intern discord first sixth centuri soon format classic poli tie notion poli thereaft
TEXT:  The fifth century general and historian Thucydides characterized stasis as a disease in his History of the Peloponnesian War, and, in so doing, his mode of description was comparable with the (then) new literature of Hippocratic medicine (Price, 2001, pp., NR: 295, Book ID: Architecture and the Body by Kim Sexton, Processed Text: fifth centuri gener historian stasi diseas histori war mode descript wa compar new literatur medicin price
TEXT:  14–15, 26).

TEXT:  3.81.5, trans. 1919). The cause of stasis was political disproportion, or a disparity in rights and benefits accorded to citizens. The Pythagorean Archytas, a friend and contemporary of Plato, confirms this in no uncertain terms, observing that ‘calculation (logismos), when discovered, stops stasis and increases concord., NR: 297, Book ID: Architecture and the Body by Kim Sexton, Processed Text: caus stasi wa polit disproport dispar right benefit citizen friend contemporari uncertain term observ calcul discov stop stasi increas concord

The notion of stasis applies to the polis to the extent that the polis is a body whose members ought to be harmoniously joined; when disorder strikes this body, these members separate in their struggles against each other., NR: 298, Book ID: Architecture and the Body by Kim Sexton, Processed Text: greedi pleonexia equal fair settl disput notion stasi poli extent poli bodi whose member ought harmoni disord strike bodi member separ struggl
TEXT:  Although the polis was the political unit most often described as a body in the Classical period, it was not the only one. For example, when Thucydides exceptionally applied the notion of stasis not to discord within an individual polis but to the Peloponnesian War, depicting Athens and Sparta as members that fight against each other only in ‘unnatural’ situations, he was subtly but powerfully arguing for the coherence of Hellas, of a natural body encompassing Greekness in general., NR: 299, Book ID: Architecture and the Body by Kim Sexton, Processed Text: although poli wa polit unit often bodi classic period wa one exampl except appli notion stasi discord within individu poli war member fight unnatur situat wa subtli power coher natur bodi gener
TEXT: 3 Although both Archaic and Classical Greeks alike saw disarticulation as weakness and death, there is a crucial difference in their understandings.

TEXT:  As Classical Greeks found a kosmos in their surroundings, their cities and inside themselves, the word kosmos came to also describe the whole of these surroundings, the cosmos or universe itself.

TEXT:  This chapter has emphasized the continuity between Archaic ideas of articulation and Classical theories of proportion. However, in the sense that proportion inaugurates not just a specific approach towards understanding and constructing order in nature, but the very notion of nature and of a natural order, it also represents a massive break between the two periods, one that has implications for the interpretation of Greek architecture., NR: 304, Book ID: Architecture and the Body by Kim Sexton, Processed Text: chapter ha continu archaic idea articul classic theori proport howev sens proport specif approach toward understand order natur notion natur natur order also massiv break two period one ha implic interpret architectur
TEXT:  Proportion offered a way for humans to emulate and represent a more perfect realm rather than figuring themselves as completely subject to the vagaries of fortune and godly whims. This gathering of agency within the human sphere, and the concurrent emergence of ideas of the self as a natural and physical body – governed, if imperfectly, by a willful individual spirit – put the Greeks on a trajectory that would culminate in the modern self announced by Descartes in the seventeenth century, fully bounded and cleanly separated into mind and body, the rational and the sensual., NR: 305, Book ID: Architecture and the Body by Kim Sexton, Processed Text: proport way human emul repres perfect realm rather complet subject vagari fortun godli whim gather agenc within human sphere concurr emerg idea self natur physic bodi imperfectli will individu spirit put trajectori would culmin modern self seventeenth centuri fulli bound cleanli mind bodi ration sensual
TEXT:  The subject of this chapter is ideas about buildings, or rather, the ideas that underlie ideas about buildings, rather than buildings themselves. Yet I hope that it will shed light on one crucial aspect of how we think about Classical Greek temples, which is this: On the one hand, the popular imagination tends to view temples as measured, abstract and white, in accordance with Platonic ideals and mathematical theories of proportion., NR: 306, Book ID: Architecture and the Body by Kim Sexton, Processed Text: subject chapter idea build rather idea underli idea build rather build yet hope shed light one crucial aspect think classic templ one hand popular imagin view templ measur abstract white accord ideal mathemat theori proport
TEXT:  On the other hand, it’s known that these buildings were used for the display of war booty and the bloody sacrifice of animals, and that they were painted in vivid colors. While one view aligns the Greeks with a revered, if vague, lineage of our own traditions of science, philosophy and democracy, the other situates them as violent and exotic – resonant, perhaps, with some animal nature of our own, but difficult to reconcile with the former view., NR: 307, Book ID: Architecture and the Body by Kim Sexton, Processed Text: hand known build use display war booti bloodi sacrific anim paint vivid color one view rever vagu lineag tradit scienc philosophi democraci violent exot reson perhap anim natur difficult reconcil former view

TEXT:  As such, the Classical Greeks did not share our conflicting visions of their temples. After all, they also found order in the hoplite phalanxes that they memorialized in their temples’ columns – in the closeness of their ranks as they pushed forward, each citizen joined to his neighbor through the overlapping of shields, as much as through their phalanx’s proportions., NR: 309, Book ID: Architecture and the Body by Kim Sexton, Processed Text: classic share conflict vision templ also found order hoplit phalanx templ column close rank forward citizen neighbor shield much phalanx proport

TEXT:  For Plato’s Timaeus, proportion was a means to explain how matter, with all its failings and sloppiness, can establish a connection with a more perfect realm. The Timaeus does not explicitly deal with buildings, and Plato’s ideas were not required for Classical temple builders to do their work in a pragmatic sense – for all its detail, Plato’s use of proportion is more numerological than technical., NR: 312, Book ID: Architecture and the Body by Kim Sexton, Processed Text: proport wa mean explain matter fail sloppi establish connect perfect realm doe explicitli deal build idea classic templ builder work pragmat sens detail use proport technic

TEXT:  Despite the variety in approaches, bodily motion was key to healing; in fact, the fixity and passivity that is required of convalescents today is quite a modern medicinal preoccupation. Due to the available textual and material evidence, our understanding of Greco-Roman medicine is dominated by two milieus, that of the private physician (the tradition of private doctors that began with Hippocrates, among whose followers were Celsus, Dioscorides, Ruphus of Ephesus and Galen), and that of healing temples dedicated to gods such as Asklepios, Apollo and/or Isis., NR: 338, Book ID: Architecture and the Body by Kim Sexton, Processed Text: despit varieti approach bodili motion wa key heal fact fixiti passiv convalesc today quit modern medicin preoccup due avail textual materi evid understand medicin domin two milieu privat physician tradit privat doctor among whose follow heal templ god
TEXT:  Until the second century, these two medical practices operated quite independently, the former traditionally made diagnoses based on Hippocratic theories on the nature of the body or its physis, its diachronic humors, and proffered cures focusing on the regulation of exercise and diet of the body in order to establish and maintain a state of balance between different humors (Pagel, 1939, pp., NR: 339, Book ID: Architecture and the Body by Kim Sexton, Processed Text: second centuri two medic practic quit independ former tradit made diagnosi base theori natur bodi diachron humor cure regul exercis diet bodi order establish maintain state balanc differ humor

TEXT:  Roman writers on health perpetuated the Greek emphasis on motion. Vitruvius (†15 BCE), the architectural writer of Emperor Augustus (r. 27 BCE–14 CE), listed the benefits of walking with exceptional scientific precision and stressed its effects on the necessary modulation of the dry and the humid body, and underscored the importance of walking in the open air and its benefits to one’s eyesight as well as to the body’s humors (De Architectura 5., NR: 341, Book ID: Architecture and the Body by Kim Sexton, Processed Text: writer health emphasi motion architectur writer emperor list benefit walk except scientif precis effect necessari modul dri humid bodi import walk open air benefit one eyesight well bodi humor
TEXT: 9.5.). Vitruvius’ contemporary Aulius Cornelius Celsus (c. 25 BCE–c. 50 CE), author of De Medicina, also believed in the curative powers of walking specifically for epilepsy. Temple medicine, by contrast, relied on oracular and ritual activities for restoring health, where the god itself was the source of miracle healing and endowed cures overnight through dreams., NR: 342, Book ID: Architecture and the Body by Kim Sexton, Processed Text: contemporari author also cur power walk specif epilepsi templ medicin contrast oracular ritual activ health god wa sourc miracl heal cure overnight dream

TEXT:  The presence of earthen ‘floor’ in the portico would have been highly unusual in Hellenistic architecture and merits a closer look in the context of asklepieia.

TEXT:  221–76). Building on the premise of controlling and ordering of bodies in motion, this chapter proposes a different hypothesis. Unlike Petsalis-Diomidis’ approach, the Foucauldianism here is not the need for classification of disease and as a result an ordering of bodies in space, but the inevitable re-ordering and designing of space according to prevailing curing practices of movement., NR: 431, Book ID: Architecture and the Body by Kim Sexton, Processed Text: build premis bodi motion chapter differ hypothesi unlik approach need classif diseas result bodi space inevit design space accord cure practic movement
TEXT:  Thus essentially my Foucaldian approach argues that the ordering mechanism was the prevailing notion of locotherapy. I postulate that the therapeutic movements at the courtyard and within the Asklepieion fell under two categories: the repetitive and mandatory ritual tasks that were controlled by the temple staff, and listed on the Lex Sacra, which outlined the cultic rules and regulations, and the personalized dietetic and therapeutic movements prescribed by the god for each individual pilgrim., NR: 432, Book ID: Architecture and the Body by Kim Sexton, Processed Text: thu essenti approach mechan wa notion postul therapeut movement courtyard within fell two categori repetit mandatori ritual task templ staff list sacrum outlin cultic rule regul dietet therapeut movement god individu pilgrim

TEXT:  This idea of the church as a volume of multicolored light is at the heart of the quotidian understanding of the Gothic.

TEXT:  But architectural historians have by and large used these texts to support of an entire theory of Gothic architecture based on Neoplatonic concepts of divine light. Foremost among these was Erwin Panofsky, who, in 1946, translated and published selections from these texts that he perceived to address Suger’s architectural intentions., NR: 501, Book ID: Architecture and the Body by Kim Sexton, Processed Text: architectur historian larg use text support entir theori architectur base concept divin light foremost among wa select text address architectur intent
TEXT:  Panofsky became the scholar most directly responsible for the association of Suger’s renovation project with Pseudo-Dionysian light metaphysics. According to Pseudo-Dionysius (fl. c. 650–c. 725), mystical ascent was achieved through contemplation on material things, which, in turn, could lead to greater intellectual understanding and unity with the godhead., NR: 502, Book ID: Architecture and the Body by Kim Sexton, Processed Text: scholar directli respons associ renov project pseudo light metaphys accord pseudo mystic ascent wa contempl materi thing turn could lead greater intellectu understand uniti godhead

TEXT:  In the De administratione, Suger wrote: Thus when–out of my delight in the beauty of the house of God–the loveliness of the many-colored gems has called me away from external cares, and worthy meditation has induced me to reflect, transferring that which is material to that which is immaterial, on the diversity of the sacred virtues: then it seems to me that I find myself dwelling, as it were, in some strange region of the universe which neither exists entirely in the slime of the earth nor entirely in the purity of Heaven; and by the grace of God, I can be transported from this inferior to that higher world in an anagogical manner., NR: 504, Book ID: Architecture and the Body by Kim Sexton, Processed Text: wrote thu delight beauti hous god loveli mani color gem ha away extern care worthi medit ha induc reflect transfer materi immateri divers sacr virtu find dwell strang region univers neither entir slime earth entir puriti heaven grace god transport inferior higher world anagog manner
TEXT:  (Suger, trans. 1979b, ch. 23) Despite the unparalleled wealth of information provided by Suger’s detailed accounts, scholars since Panofsky continue to entertain lively debates over what the abbot accomplished and intended architecturally at St-Denis (Kidson, 1987): Did he even know about the Pseudo-Dionysian metaphysics of light or did he have a hedonistic fixation on shimmering color? Did he understand anything about Gothic structure? Did he ‘invent’ Gothic architecture? Rather than approach the problem through the lens of the contemporary philosophical community, this chapter highlights the role of medieval ‘science’ for theology in forging not just a novel style of architecture but a new understanding of what it meant to build in the Middle Ages., NR: 505, Book ID: Architecture and the Body by Kim Sexton, Processed Text: despit unparallel wealth inform provid detail account scholar sinc continu entertain live debat abbot accomplish intend architectur even know pseudo metaphys light hedonist fixat shimmer color understand anyth structur invent architectur rather approach problem len contemporari philosoph commun chapter highlight role mediev scienc theolog forg novel style architectur new understand meant build middl age

TEXT:  The materiality of the church tells an important story about the cosmological role of craft, which is elided when examining the building iconographically.

TEXT:  Elements and divine bodies As divine man, Christ was the perfect material body of the terrestrial realm.

TEXT:  Figure 3.1 The façade of the Abbey Church at Saint-Denis Photo: author The belief that rock was condensed water can be traced to the writings of Aristotle’s student Theophrastus (c. 371–ca. 287 BCE), but the theological significance of the matter developed from Neoplatonic philosopher and probable Christian Calcidius’ fourth-century partial translation of and commentary on Plato’s Timaeus., NR: 512, Book ID: Architecture and the Body by Kim Sexton, Processed Text: figur facad abbey church saint photo author belief rock wa condens water write student theolog signific matter philosoph probabl fourth centuri partial translat commentari

Glosses on the translation by Bernard of Chartres (died after 1124) systematized interpretation of Plato’s difficult text and made it more accessible to churchmen associated with what has come to be known as the School of Chartres, such as Bernardus Silvestris (1085–1178) and William of Conches (c., NR: 513, Book ID: Architecture and the Body by Kim Sexton, Processed Text: cosmolog receiv translat profoundli proto scientif theolog understand world twelfth centuri gloss translat interpret difficult text made access churchman associ ha come known school conch

From antiquity to the Middle Ages, the body of Christ functioned as an exemplar of material perfection, but for medieval thinkers the understanding of this highest state of matter was complicated by the fact that the divine man had three distinct and separate bodies., NR: 514, Book ID: Architecture and the Body by Kim Sexton, Processed Text: antiqu middl age bodi exemplar materi perfect mediev thinker understand highest state matter wa complic fact divin man three distinct separ bodi

TEXT:  The third body was the more conceptually complex and problematic mysterious body, the corpus mysticum of Christ, which would ‘appear’ during the performance of the Eucharistic rite. Suger’s new church at Saint-Denis might have been conceptualized as the mysterious body, being simultaneously an incarnation physically through its stone and both physically and figuratively through human bodies., NR: 516, Book ID: Architecture and the Body by Kim Sexton, Processed Text: third bodi wa conceptu complex problemat mysteri bodi corpu would appear perform eucharist rite new church saint might mysteri bodi simultan incarn physic stone physic figur human bodi
TEXT:  Such positions, however, were not without their challengers. In fact, by the time Suger was considering the rebuilding of St-Denis, a controversy generated by theologian Berengar of Tours (c. 999–1088) in the late eleventh century questioned the doctrine that the bread and wine of the Eucharist truly became the body and blood of the three-bodied divine man., NR: 517, Book ID: Architecture and the Body by Kim Sexton, Processed Text: posit howev without challeng fact time wa consid controversi theologian tour late eleventh centuri doctrin bread wine truli bodi blood three bodi divin man
TEXT:  Berengar posited that the bread and wine functioned as signs merely pointing to the celestial body of Christ rather than the mysterious body actually being present in the Eucharistic aliments.

TEXT:  To overcome Berengar’s claim, theologians such as Rupert of Deutz (1075–1129) counter-argued that the body of Christ in all forms should be considered the flesh-and-blood historical body. The mysterious body now presented a problem_ What exactly was it? Eleventh and twelfth-century questions about the truth of Christ’s humanity, such as Berengar’s, made the mysterious body suspect., NR: 519, Book ID: Architecture and the Body by Kim Sexton, Processed Text: overcom claim theologian counter bodi form consid flesh blood histor bodi mysteri bodi exactli wa eleventh twelfth centuri question truth human made mysteri bodi suspect
TEXT:  After all, would not the earthly Christ that appeared in the Eucharistic rite be the same body that was incarnated as human flesh? If the bread was not a symbol and was in fact the body and blood of Christ, why would it not simply be the historical body? The necessity of conflating the flesh and blood Christ with the body that appeared in the rite required a change in the way that the material divinity of Christ was understood., NR: 520, Book ID: Architecture and the Body by Kim Sexton, Processed Text: would earthli eucharist rite bodi wa human flesh bread wa symbol wa fact bodi blood would simpli histor bodi necess flesh blood bodi rite chang way materi divin wa understood
TEXT:  The problem of reconciling the two incarnations – historical body and mysterious body – can be considered analogous to the dual act of Suger in reforming his abbey. Theologians shifted material divinity of Christ from the power that informed the bread, and thus made it into Christ’s body, to the power of the members of the church offered in support of the ritual act of the priest., NR: 521, Book ID: Architecture and the Body by Kim Sexton, Processed Text: problem reconcil two incarn histor bodi mysteri bodi consid analog dual act abbey theologian materi divin power inform bread thu made bodi power member church support ritual act priest

If the science of polishing of stone unveiled the second creation revealed the mysterious body (as noted above), and crafted a wall to defend against chaos, then, at least metaphorically for Bernardus, the ultimate materiality of man – in this context, the equivalent of mysterious body of Christ – was also that of a shining stone wall., NR: 562, Book ID: Architecture and the Body by Kim Sexton, Processed Text: scienc stone unveil second creation reveal mysteri bodi note wall defend chao least metaphor ultim materi man context equival mysteri bodi wa also shine stone wall

Having gone chymically from bread to stone, Petrus Cellensis’s metaphor then turned pointedly architectural when he described the condition of man as a crafted, yet unconsecrated, house. He wrote that, by rejecting the mutability of secular habits and the desires of the flesh, man can metaphorically craft himself into wedge-shaped stones (cuneus) that are joined together to form a wall capable of encircling and containing sin (Petrus Cellensis, Sermon 39, PL 2020:766a)., NR: 573, Book ID: Architecture and the Body by Kim Sexton, Processed Text: gone bread stone metaphor turn pointedli architectur condit man yet unconsecr hous wrote mutabl secular habit desir flesh man metaphor craft wedg shape stone cuneu togeth form wall capabl sin sermon

TEXT:  Denis, martyred Bishop of Paris; and Pseudo-Dionysius the Aeropagite, late fifth- or early sixth-century author of a Christianized Neo platonic light metaphysics. The assumption that the three figures were one and the same formed the basis of St-Denis’s claim to be the royal abbey of France, and as early as the sixth century, the abbey became the burial place of the kings and queens of France as well as the repository for royal documents (Crosby, 1987, pp., NR: 585, Book ID: Architecture and the Body by Kim Sexton, Processed Text: bishop pseudo late fifth earli sixth centuri author neo light metaphys assumpt three figur one form basi claim royal abbey earli sixth centuri abbey burial place king queen well repositori royal document

The Merovingian king Dagobert I (died 639) expanded the chapel, but it was the construction of a larger basilica and crypt by Abbot Fulrad (710–748) that cemented the association of St-Denis with the monarchy of France early in the Carolingian era (Crosby, 1987, pp., NR: 587, Book ID: Architecture and the Body by Kim Sexton, Processed Text: king expand chapel wa construct basilica crypt abbot associ monarchi earli era

TEXT:  Part of this work involved the creation of a church that matched this political ambition. While Suger’s stated goal for his renovations at St-Denis was practical, namely, to increase the church’s capacity to handle pilgrims, his renovation program for his abbey and its church must be seen as part of his larger theological agenda to place the world in order with state and king subordinate to bishop and abbey, which were in turn subordinate to the universal church and God., NR: 591, Book ID: Architecture and the Body by Kim Sexton, Processed Text: part work involv creation church polit ambit state goal renov wa practic name increas church capac handl pilgrim renov program abbey church must seen part theolog agenda place world order state king subordin bishop abbey turn subordin univers church god

In the first sense, the restoration of the church was the crafting of a pile of stones to rebuild the west work, to enlarge the nave and to create the chevet., NR: 606, Book ID: Architecture and the Body by Kim Sexton, Processed Text: abbot undertook restor abbey church use term mole first sens restor church wa pile stone rebuild west work enlarg nave creat
TEXT: 6 In the second sense, he ordered the mob of people – that is, their soul – who inhabited that pile. In the case of the first, the church was the body of Christ, materially. The order of the ‘work’ is significant, first the physical church that will receive Christ as the head of its body must be prepared., NR: 607, Book ID: Architecture and the Body by Kim Sexton, Processed Text: second sens order mob peopl soul inhabit pile case first church wa bodi materi order work signific first physic church receiv head bodi must prepar
TEXT:  While this includes the westwork, the true change in the structure occurs with respect to the primary ritual function of the chevet as the site for the mass. The westwork, as a representation of the ecclesia, supports the church’s ritual function and signals the enactment of the miracle of transformation much as the Bernardus’s tomb shines when its stones are actualized (as noted above)., NR: 608, Book ID: Architecture and the Body by Kim Sexton, Processed Text: true chang structur respect primari ritual function site mass represent ecclesia support church ritual function signal enact miracl transform much tomb shine stone note
TEXT:  A few pages after describing the dedication of the foundations of the choir (Suger, trans. 1979a, ch. 5), Suger turned to Ephesians 2:19–22 to portray the progress of construction three years later, adapting Paul’s metaphor of Christ as the cornerstone that joins the walls together (Ephesians in italics): Now therefore you are no more strangers and foreigners7, he says, but fellow citizens with the saints and of the household of God; and are built in upon the foundations of the apostles and prophets8, Jesus Christ Himself being the chief cornerstone which joins one wall to the other; in Whom all the building—whether spiritual (‘ritualis’) or material—grows into one holy temple in the Lord., NR: 609, Book ID: Architecture and the Body by Kim Sexton, Processed Text: page dedic foundat choir turn portray progress construct three year later metaphor cornerston join wall togeth therefor stranger foreign say fellow citizen saint household god built upon foundat apostl prophet chief cornerston join one wall build whether spiritu materi one holi templ lord

TEXT: 9 (Suger, trans. 1979a, ch. 5) The abbot edited the original sense of the passage to emphasize the importance of the church as a building compared to church as an assembly of people. He states that the apostles and prophets taught his congregation and monks how to build in a ceremonial or ritual way (spiritualiter) so that now that they could strive to build higher and more competently in a material way., NR: 611, Book ID: Architecture and the Body by Kim Sexton, Processed Text: abbot origin sens passag emphas import church build church assembl peopl state apostl prophet taught congreg monk build ceremoni ritual way could strive build higher compet materi way
TEXT:  For Paul, the relationship between Christ and building was metaphorical, a way of explaining how two divergent populations of different faiths could be unified into a single ecclesia. Suger, however, refused to take Paul’s letter only within the metaphorical register in which it was written., NR: 612, Book ID: Architecture and the Body by Kim Sexton, Processed Text: relationship build wa metaphor way explain two diverg popul differ faith could unifi singl ecclesia howev take letter within metaphor regist wa written
TEXT:  In a few lines he twice inserts the material dimension into the letter to focus on the matter of the church that is equivalent to the matter of the Son of God.

TEXT:  Suger’s historical reading of Paul, which ignored the metaphorical intention, reflected the theological shift under taken by churchmen such as Hugh of Saint-Victor and Bernardus Silvestris who began the process of understanding supernatural phenomena through natural philosophy., NR: 615, Book ID: Architecture and the Body by Kim Sexton, Processed Text: histor read metaphor intent reflect theolog shift taken churchman saint victor process understand supernatur phenomenon natur philosophi
TEXT:  Suger pushed far beyond offering a material equivalent of Paul’s spiritual edifice when he inserted himself into the relief sculpture of the bronze doors (c. 1137) in his church’s new westwork, where he had himself depicted offering a cabochon loaf of bread toward the roundel containing the Supper at Emmaus scene from Luke 24:13–35 (Figure 3., NR: 616, Book ID: Architecture and the Body by Kim Sexton, Processed Text: far beyond offer materi equival spiritu edific insert relief sculptur bronz door church new offer cabochon loaf bread toward roundel supper scene luke figur

TEXT:  For the last time, Christ is representing the materially perfect flesh of God’s son, the ultimate exemplar of the human, the corpus mysticum, the sacramental body. Suger, by representing himself offering bread to the Emmaus scene on the doors of the church, conflated his gift of the renovated church with Christ as Eucharist and himself with Christ as celebrant of the mass., NR: 618, Book ID: Architecture and the Body by Kim Sexton, Processed Text: last time materi perfect flesh god son ultim exemplar human corpu sacrament bodi offer bread scene door church conflat gift church celebr mass
TEXT:  As Suger celebrated the mass in the new chevet, the rite he undertook was a request for Christ to return to earth in human form once again. The reconstructed chevet is the material vessel that both enables the reappearance of the Son of God and functions as the container or his presence., NR: 619, Book ID: Architecture and the Body by Kim Sexton, Processed Text: celebr mass new rite undertook wa request return earth human form reconstruct materi vessel reappear son god function contain presenc

TEXT:  These stone figures of the church unified in consecration embody the vicars of Christ the rock within the walls. The iconographic program of the portals ordered the historical and biblical figures into the ecclesiastical body, which pointed toward the future of this alternate sense of the mysterious Christ as the power the members of the church offered in support of the Eucharistic rite., NR: 625, Book ID: Architecture and the Body by Kim Sexton, Processed Text: stone figur church unifi consecr embodi vicar rock within wall iconograph program portal order histor figur ecclesiast bodi point toward futur altern sens mysteri power member church support eucharist rite

TEXT: 3). In Suger’s book on the consecration of St-Denis, editor Panofksy noted that the abbot did not mention the tower of the Heavenly Jerusalem being built of gems (Suger, trans. 1979a, ch. 4, p. 102, note 43)., NR: 627, Book ID: Architecture and the Body by Kim Sexton, Processed Text: book consecr editor note abbot mention tower heavenli built gem note
TEXT: 11 He did not need to include it. The abbot and king were truly building the church with gemstones as they placed stones in the foundation and cemented them one to another. As described above, Bernardus explained how stones, once polished, glow with the mystical body, just as the walls of St-Denis radiate with the color of the stained glass., NR: 628, Book ID: Architecture and the Body by Kim Sexton, Processed Text: need includ abbot king truli build church stone foundat one anoth stone polish glow mystic bodi wall radiat color glass
TEXT:  He also described the human combination of body and soul as a pile of rocks covering a spirit.

TEXT:  Rearranging the stones that made the body a tomb transformed it from an evil body into one that let the soul shine. This change is the analogue of the work at St-Denis. Stacking of gem upon gem to build the church was the artisanal transformation of a body of rubble into a shining edifice., NR: 630, Book ID: Architecture and the Body by Kim Sexton, Processed Text: stone made bodi tomb evil bodi one let soul shine chang analogu work gem upon gem build church wa transform bodi rubbl shine edific
TEXT:  Suger crafted the body of the church so that it could shine; the problematic pseudo-Dionysian light need not enter into the conception of the choir.

TEXT:  Suger’s De consecratione ecclesiae is not just about the dedication of the building; it is also a record of how Suger arranged the people who filled it on the day of the consecration. From the beginning, his justification for making changes to the physical body of the church was to rectify the improper ordering of the people inside., NR: 632, Book ID: Architecture and the Body by Kim Sexton, Processed Text: dedic build also record peopl fill day consecr begin justif make chang physic bodi church wa rectifi improp peopl insid
TEXT:  He described the chaotic crowds that often filled the cramped church he inherited. Bodies pressed up against each other and churned about turbulently. In explaining how he managed to make an ordered procession of the ecclesia within the church for a proper dedication rite, he noted that Louis VI was given the task of keeping back the throng at the doors of the church in order to prevent them from disrupting the ceremony., NR: 633, Book ID: Architecture and the Body by Kim Sexton, Processed Text: chaotic crowd often fill cramp church bodi turbul explain make order process ecclesia within church proper dedic rite note wa given task keep back throng door church order prevent ceremoni
TEXT:  As the walls and stones of the church were blessed, Louis apparently went so far as to beat back the mob from the doors of the church with canes and sticks. At the limits of the ecclesiastical body, the king and his men formed a defensive wall that doubled the wall of physical stones to protect the ordered movement of the rite., NR: 634, Book ID: Architecture and the Body by Kim Sexton, Processed Text: wall stone church bless appar went far beat back mob door church cane stick limit ecclesiast bodi king men form defens wall doubl wall physic stone protect order movement rite
TEXT:  The material church was a pile of stones built into a wall. The ecclesiastical church was a human wall, a different kind of crafted moles. With unruly crowds outside the basilica and an ordered congregation inside, Suger’s account once again mirrors Ephesians in that the faithful are ‘builded’ together on a foundation constructed by the apostles and prophets., NR: 635, Book ID: Architecture and the Body by Kim Sexton, Processed Text: materi church wa pile stone built wall ecclesiast church wa human wall differ kind mole unruli crowd outsid basilica order congreg insid account mirror faith togeth foundat apostl prophet

TEXT:  Suger extended his renovation of the ecclesiastical body outward to encompass the entire, nascent territory of France. The abbot’s actions imply that he was early to understand corporeal models of medieval kingship, namely, the doctrine in which a monarch had two bodies, his physical body and his political or mystical body which embodied the state, the political equivalent of Christ having two natures, human and divine (Kantorowicz, 1957)., NR: 638, Book ID: Architecture and the Body by Kim Sexton, Processed Text: extend renov ecclesiast bodi outward encompass entir nascent territori abbot action impli wa earli understand corpor model mediev kingship name doctrin monarch two bodi physic bodi polit mystic bodi state polit equival two natur human divin
TEXT:  Suger went further, however, in an attempt to institute the king of France as the vassal of St-Denis.

TEXT:  Grant suggests that Suger conceptualized himself, his abbey and France, as an analogous Pauline church that completed the universal church of Peter centered on Rome.

TEXT:  The powerful properties of the chymical transformations of matter and bodies, as understood by contemporary theologians, would naturally have undergirded Suger’s worldview.

TEXT:  To subordinate the king of France to the abbey of St-Denis, Suger forged charters establishing the proper hierarchical relationship between the king and the church. He revived St-Denis as the burial place of kings, a space in which the remains of their physical bodies in magnificent sarcophagi could glow as cabochons in the refracted colored light of the choir., NR: 645, Book ID: Architecture and the Body by Kim Sexton, Processed Text: subordin king abbey forg charter proper hierarch relationship king church burial place king space remain physic bodi magnific sarcophagu could glow cabochon refract color light choir

TEXT:  In the High Middle Ages, penance was one of the seven sacraments recognized by the Catholic Church and administered by priests. Medieval theologians defined sacraments as the outward, visible, physical instantiation of inner, invisible, spiritual grace: see, for instance, the authoritative statement by Peter Lombard in his Sentences (1971, vol., NR: 694, Book ID: Architecture and the Body by Kim Sexton, Processed Text: high middl age penanc wa one seven sacrament cathol church priest mediev theologian defin sacrament outward visibl physic inner invis spiritu grace see instanc authorit statement peter lombard sentenc vol
TEXT:  1, p. 233). Of all the sacraments, it was penance that received the most attention from the circle of the later twelfth-century Parisian master Peter the Chanter (†1197), well known to us now as a theologian concerned with practical morality (Baldwin, 1970)., NR: 695, Book ID: Architecture and the Body by Kim Sexton, Processed Text: sacrament wa penanc receiv attent circl later twelfth centuri master peter chanter well known theologian concern practic moral
TEXT:  Most medieval theologians agreed that there were multiple elements comprising penance, a sacrament that involved the body in its hidden cavities and its exterior manifestations: these were infusion of grace, contrition of heart, confession of mouth, and satisfaction of deed (Baldwin, 1970, vol., NR: 696, Book ID: Architecture and the Body by Kim Sexton, Processed Text: mediev theologian agre multipl element penanc sacrament involv bodi hidden caviti exterior manifest infus grace contrit heart confess mouth satisfact deed vol
TEXT:  1, p. 50). A major event in the history of penance took place in the early thirteenth century, when church-wide ecclesiastical legislation required Christians to confess their sins at least once a year, per the provisions of canon 21 of the Fourth Lateran Council, held at the pope’s Lateran Palace in Rome in 1215: All the faithful of both sexes shall after they have reached the age of discretion faithfully confess all their sins at least once a year to their own (parish) priest and perform to the best of their ability the penance imposed, receiving reverently at least at Easter the sacrament of the Eucharist, unless perchance at the advice of their own priest they may for a good reason abstain for a time from its reception; otherwise they shall be cut off from the Church (excommunicated) during life and deprived of Christian burial in death., NR: 697, Book ID: Architecture and the Body by Kim Sexton, Processed Text: major event histori penanc took place earli thirteenth centuri church wide ecclesiast legisl confess sin least year per provis canon fourth council pope palac faith sex shall age discret faith confess sin least year parish priest perform best abil penanc rever least easter sacrament unless perchanc advic priest may good reason abstain time recept otherwis shall cut church life burial death

TEXT:  Penitents’ confessions and confessors’ discernment of their souls were no easy business.

TEXT:  274). According to Peter the Chanter, the resulting confession should be a full and frank self-accusation, heard by a confessor who plays the role of both father and mother in order to sting and to salve the penitent’s soul, to rebuke with words and to nourish with milk (Peter the Chanter, 1855, col., NR: 705, Book ID: Architecture and the Body by Kim Sexton, Processed Text: accord peter chanter result confess full frank self accus confessor play role father mother order sting salv penit soul rebuk word nourish milk peter chanter col
TEXT:  314).1 Bishop Odo of Paris in his influential synodal constitutions (from c. 1197) enjoined his priests ‘diligently [to] search out sins’ but with ‘the greatest care and caution … in such a way that the matter of confession is supplied by the sins’ (McNeill and Gamer, 1938, p., NR: 706, Book ID: Architecture and the Body by Kim Sexton, Processed Text: bishop influenti synod constitut priest dilig search sin care caution way matter confess sin
TEXT:  412). In preparing their parishioners for the sacrament, confessors were urged to become physiognomists for a time in order to ‘read’ the faces of those who came to them for forgiveness. If the penitent, to be ‘read’ by his or her confessor, was in turn ‘reading’ the cathedral building before and after confession, I would propose that certain cathedral portals, especially those that featured imagery of penitence, can be studied as singular places for the progression to and from confession, meaningful channels into and out of the church (Figure 4., NR: 707, Book ID: Architecture and the Body by Kim Sexton, Processed Text: parishion sacrament confessor becom time order read face came forgiv penit read confessor wa turn read cathedr build confess would propos certain cathedr portal especi featur imageri penit studi singular place progress confess meaning channel church figur

TEXT:  The ‘placescape’, he says, is doubly bound, created through a ‘collusion’ of body and world in their ‘common integumentation’ (Casey, 2009, p. 25).

TEXT:  This thinking on penance, arising from the monastic milieu (Kramer, 2015, p. 14), belonged to the more liberal atmosphere of the twelfth century and has been described by scholars as a humanization of confession (Payen, 1977, pp., NR: 719, Book ID: Architecture and the Body by Kim Sexton, Processed Text: think penanc monast milieu liber atmospher twelfth centuri ha scholar human confess
TEXT:  403, 405). Later, a more institutionalized process of confession evolved during the thirteenth century, participating in the growing legalization of the church. Evidence of an increasingly sacramental theorizing of penance, new methods exalted the confessor, who went from an incidental role to that of an active agent in the reconciliation of sinner and church (Payen, 1977, pp., NR: 720, Book ID: Architecture and the Body by Kim Sexton, Processed Text: later process confess thirteenth centuri grow legal church evid increasingli sacrament penanc new method exalt confessor went incident role activ agent reconcili sinner church
TEXT:  407, 413, 416, 418; Boyle, 1982, p. 230).2 Indeed, priests now tended to the soul as God’s agents in areas that had earlier been regarded as His domain alone (Kramer, 2015, pp. 21, 80). Recent scholarship highlights the paradox of the evidence which, on the one hand, suggests the emergence of a new conception of the individual and an authentic ‘inner’ identity arising in the twelfth century, while, on the other, requiring the externalization of this interiority through confession (Kramer, 2015, p., NR: 721, Book ID: Architecture and the Body by Kim Sexton, Processed Text: inde priest soul god agent area domain alon recent scholarship highlight paradox evid one hand emerg new concept individu authent inner ident twelfth centuri extern interior confess
TEXT:  4). Confession perforce became more codified. Priests were to train themselves to be searchers of souls, not simply automatic dispensers of penance (Boyle, 1985, p. 32). The second half of the Fouth Lateran Council’s canon 21 cited above asserts: Let the priest be discreet and cautious that he may pour wine and oil into the wounds of the one injured after the manner of a skillful physician, carefully inquiring into the circumstances of the sinner and the sin, from the nature of which he may understand what kind of advice to give and what remedy to apply, making use of different experiments to heal the sick one., NR: 722, Book ID: Architecture and the Body by Kim Sexton, Processed Text: confess perforc priest train searcher soul simpli automat dispens penanc second half fouth council canon let priest discreet cautiou may pour wine oil wound one injur manner skill physician care inquir circumst sinner sin natur may understand kind advic give remedi appli make use differ experi heal sick one

Alain warns that the confessor should advise the penitent that contrition must be genuine, not feigned [vera non sophistica], and that his – or her – tears should also not be feigned but rather emanate from the fountainhead of the heart, the wording used by another contemporary author, Petrus Comestor, in his Historia scholastica rendition of the Judgment of Solomon (Alain de Lille, 1965: 198; Petrus Comestor, 1855, col., NR: 745, Book ID: Architecture and the Body by Kim Sexton, Processed Text: confessor advis penit contrit must genuin feign vera non tear also feign rather eman fountainhead heart word use anoth contemporari author rendit judgment col

TEXT:  The confessor, like Solomon, who is pictured seated to the left on the lintel, must correctly interpret the narrative he hears (Figure 4.3). The centrality of the true mother and the particular reworking of the story at Chartres, with its emphasis on the legible coordination of depth and surface, point to a transitional moment in the theorizing of penance when the contritionism of the twelfth century had not yet wholly receded before the new agency of the priest in the thirteenth., NR: 747, Book ID: Architecture and the Body by Kim Sexton, Processed Text: confessor like pictur seat left lintel must correctli interpret narr figur central true mother particular stori emphasi legibl depth surfac point transit moment penanc twelfth centuri yet wholli new agenc priest thirteenth
TEXT:  Similarly transitional was the influential penitential of Robert of Flamborough, composed between 1208 and 1213 and attested in the Chartres cathedral library in a thirteenth-century manuscript (Chartres, Bibliothèque Municipale, MS 234), which, unfortunately, was destroyed in 1944 (Robert of Flamborough, 1971)., NR: 748, Book ID: Architecture and the Body by Kim Sexton, Processed Text: similarli transit wa influenti penitenti compos cathedr librari thirteenth centuri manuscript unfortun wa
TEXT:  Its modern editor remarks on Robert’s zeal for both the ‘old law’ (of the penitential canons) and the ‘new law’ (of the twelfth-century decretals): his work incorporated older lists of penitential canons but also expanded advice to the confessor about how to listen to the narrative he would hear (see also Kuttner, 1944, p., NR: 749, Book ID: Architecture and the Body by Kim Sexton, Processed Text: modern editor remark zeal old law penitenti canon new law twelfth centuri work incorpor older list penitenti canon also expand advic confessor listen narr would hear see also
TEXT:  496; Longère, 1977, p. 52). Circumstantial evidence for the early presence or influence of Robert’s penitential at Chartres lies in the almost immediate citation of passages from it in the second redaction of Peter of Roissy’s Manuale de mysteriis ecclesiae, dating to c., NR: 750, Book ID: Architecture and the Body by Kim Sexton, Processed Text: circumstanti evid earli presenc influenc penitenti lie almost immedi citat passag second redact peter date
TEXT:  1208 to 1213 (Robert of Flamborough, 1971, p. 9). This is precisely the period in which the Old Testament portal was begun, if not completed. Further, it is Peter whom Adolf Katzenellenbogen, author of a classic monograph on the Chartres sculpture, credits with the iconographic programs of the transept facades, and especially that of the Old Testament portal (1959, p., NR: 751, Book ID: Architecture and the Body by Kim Sexton, Processed Text: precis period old testament portal wa begun peter author classic monograph sculptur credit iconograph program transept facad especi old testament portal
TEXT:  78). Not surprisingly, the passages that Peter excerpted from Robert (on holy orders, marriage and penance) stand out from the rest of his manual due to their very different character, ‘markedly practical and canonical’ (Kuttner, 1944, p., NR: 752, Book ID: Architecture and the Body by Kim Sexton, Processed Text: surprisingli passag peter holi order marriag penanc stand rest manual due differ charact markedli practic canon
TEXT:  498). While confession and penance by no means provide the only context within which to interpret the imagery of the Old Testament portal, the exact contemporaneity of the lintel’s narrative innovations and the theoretical and pastoral development of confession with its proto-scientific focus on physiognomy as well as a documentable connection between the penitential teaching of Parisian masters and the intellectual environment at Chartres are very suggestive indeed., NR: 753, Book ID: Architecture and the Body by Kim Sexton, Processed Text: confess penanc mean provid context within interpret imageri old testament portal exact contemporan lintel narr innov theoret pastor develop confess proto scientif focu physiognomi well connect penitenti teach master intellectu environ suggest inde

TEXT:  A majority of cathedral clerics’ homes and other secondary buildings at Chartres lined the northern part of the cathedral precinct (Figure 4.4); in addition, petitioners who sought an audience with the bishop in his palace to the northeast of the cathedral or who were called to his court of justice had to pass through the north cloister, along the flank of the cathedral (Hollengreen, 1998, pp., NR: 755, Book ID: Architecture and the Body by Kim Sexton, Processed Text: major cathedr cleric home secondari build line northern part cathedr precinct figur addit petition sought audienc bishop palac northeast cathedr court justic north cloister along flank cathedr

Episcopal punishment was meted out there, too, via exposure of wrongdoers on the bishop’s ‘stone’, located just opposite the northeast corner of the cathedral’s north porch, at the entrance to the bishop’s private property (Jusselin, 1940, p., NR: 756, Book ID: Architecture and the Body by Kim Sexton, Processed Text: episcop punish wa via exposur wrongdoer bishop stone opposit northeast corner cathedr north porch entranc bishop privat properti
TEXT:  150). This ‘stone’ was a kind of pillory like that pictured in one of the so-called ‘school’ reliefs adjacent to the south transept portal of Notre Dame in Paris; that image, associated with the troubled relationship between the bishop of Paris and the university community, faced the bishop’s palace on the Îlede-la-Cité., NR: 757, Book ID: Architecture and the Body by Kim Sexton, Processed Text: stone wa kind pillori like pictur one school relief adjac south transept portal dame imag associ relationship bishop univers commun face bishop palac cite

TEXT:  This distinction resulted in the theoretical elaboration of two fora for penance: an interior one in which the priest secretly hears confession and an exterior one in which an ecclesiastical tribunal tries crimes (Baldwin, 1970, vol., NR: 761, Book ID: Architecture and the Body by Kim Sexton, Processed Text: distinct theoret elabor two forum penanc interior one priest secretli confess exterior one ecclesiast tribun tri crime vol
TEXT:  1, pp. 51–2). A church portal was an ideal location from which to address both these arenas (Figure 4.1), since a portal functioned both as an entrance into sacred space, the privileged locus of the interior forum of private confession,5 and as a frons scenae for activity in front of it, including any persistent rites of public penance., NR: 762, Book ID: Architecture and the Body by Kim Sexton, Processed Text: church portal wa ideal locat address arena figur sinc portal entranc sacr space privileg locu interior forum privat confess activ front persist rite public penanc

TEXT:  As Mary Mansfield amply demonstrates in The Humiliation of Sinners: Public Penance in Thirteenth-Century France, the old rites of public penance, such as wearing penitential clothing or undertaking penitential processions, did not wither in the face of a new theological emphasis on private, sacramental penance – the system of contrition, confession and satisfaction discussed above (Mansfield, 1995, pp., NR: 764, Book ID: Architecture and the Body by Kim Sexton, Processed Text: mari ampli humili sinner public penanc thirteenth centuri old rite public penanc wear penitenti cloth undertak penitenti process wither face new theolog emphasi privat sacrament penanc system contrit confess satisfact
TEXT:  58–9, 90). Nevertheless, those rites did change. Over the course of the two centuries from c. 1150 to c. 1350, liturgical developments sanctioned an increasing degree of general lay participation in the ceremonies of Ash Wednesday and Maundy Thursday, particularly by means of the imposition of ashes on all present – not just public penitents – on the former day and of general absolutions pronounced on the congregation on the latter (Mansfield 1995, chaps., NR: 765, Book ID: Architecture and the Body by Kim Sexton, Processed Text: nevertheless rite chang cours two centuri liturg develop increas degre gener lay particip ceremoni ash maundi particularli mean imposit ash present public penit former day gener absolut pronounc congreg latter chap
TEXT:  6–7, esp. pp. 209–10). Indeed, Mansfield includes Chartres among a handful of northern French dioceses that she terms ‘precocious’ with regard to the generalization and regularization of lay penance (Mansfield, 1995, p., NR: 766, Book ID: Architecture and the Body by Kim Sexton, Processed Text: inde among hand northern dioces term precoci regard gener regular lay penanc
TEXT:  228). This judgment corresponds well to my tropological reading of parts of the Old Testament portal. The changes she describes worked to encourage the collective expiation and reconciliation of all while diminishing the symbolic scapegoating of a few (Mansfield, 1995, pp., NR: 767, Book ID: Architecture and the Body by Kim Sexton, Processed Text: judgment well tropolog read part old testament portal chang work encourag collect expiat reconcili symbol
TEXT:  180–2, 213, and 291). It can be tempting to see the Chartres north transept and its imagery, in its physical context of the north cloister, as reinforcing a show of the clerical power to judge. However, in the practice of solemn public penance at Chartres, the penance-related rite that took place on the north porch was not the formal expulsion of penitents from the building on Ash Wednesday, at the outset of Lent – that occurred at the west facade Royal Portal – but rather the reconciliation and re-entry of penitents to the cathedral on Maundy Thursday, preceding the Triduum that culminated in Easter., NR: 768, Book ID: Architecture and the Body by Kim Sexton, Processed Text: tempt see north transept imageri physic context north cloister show cleric power judg howev practic solemn public penanc penanc relat rite took place north porch wa formal expuls penit build ash outset lent west facad royal portal rather reconcili entri penit cathedr maundi preced triduum easter

TEXT: 2). There are many charged portals at Chartres, and their paradoxical role as both path from unsanctified outdoor space to hallowed interior and place of reckoning can be underappreciated.

TEXT:  The Virgin is present at Chartres in the relic of her tunic, her own holy ‘second skin,’ located at the main altar (Fassler, 2010, p. 206). Fassler wonderfully conjures up the sense of alternate reality that, she implies, may have affected some visitors to the cathedral, visitors who ‘found themselves’ there as they contemplated the beginning and end of the life of Christ (in the lateral tympana of the west facade) from a position close to the column-statues of the ancestors of Christ on the portal embrasures: ‘Christians,’ she says, ‘who stepped through openings in this carved “membrane” representative of the Virgin herself were potentially ingrafted as new shoots of the ancient lineage clustered around them in a special ceremony of adventus [or ritual arrival]’ (Fassler, 2010, p., NR: 774, Book ID: Architecture and the Body by Kim Sexton, Processed Text: virgin present relic tunic holi second skin main altar wonder sens altern realiti may affect visitor cathedr visitor found begin end life later tympanum west facad posit close column statu ancestor portal embrasur say step open membran repres virgin potenti new shoot ancient lineag cluster around special ceremoni ritual arriv

TEXT:  Edward Casey, whom I cited earlier, would have us understand that a building ‘condenses a culture in one place’ (Casey, 2009, p. 32). A later assertion on Casey’s part is more dynamic and more challenging: ‘Place’s inflow and outflow’, he says, ‘are such that to be fully in a place is never to be confined to a punctuate position; it is to be already on the way out’ (Casey, 2009., NR: 777, Book ID: Architecture and the Body by Kim Sexton, Processed Text: would understand build cultur one place later assert part dynam place inflow outflow say fulli place never confin punctuat posit alreadi way

TEXT:  The specific stages of childbirth, however, are likened tropologically (or morally) to the sacramental stages of penance (Neff, 1998). In similar manner, the Judgment of Solomon with its true mother functions as a rich, complex complement – again, both typological and tropological – to the motherhood of Mary shown on the pendant lintel at the east end of the facade, on the left-most Infancy portal, and the ordeal of childbirth she, alone among women, was able to avoid., NR: 782, Book ID: Architecture and the Body by Kim Sexton, Processed Text: specif stage childbirth howev tropolog moral sacrament stage penanc similar manner judgment true mother function rich complex complement typolog tropolog motherhood mari shown pendant lintel east end facad left infanc portal ordeal childbirth alon among woman wa abl avoid

TEXT:  325–39). Anthony’s interest in childbirth as a metaphor for penance may have come both from a life spent fighting ailments and from his decision in the later years of his life to take up residence in Padua, home to that city’s famous university (first mentioned in 1222) which had an anatomical school by 1250 (Ongaro, 2001)., NR: 787, Book ID: Architecture and the Body by Kim Sexton, Processed Text: interest childbirth metaphor penanc may come life spent fight ailment decis later year life take resid home citi famou univers first anatom school ongaro

TEXT:  As an additional protagonist in Anthony’s meditation, the obstetrician symbolizes the priest who cares for souls in confession – in the early thirteenth century with ever greater agency; in the same period, as Monica Green has documented, physicians were starting to care for women in childbirth with increasing authority over midwives (Green, 2008, pp., NR: 792, Book ID: Architecture and the Body by Kim Sexton, Processed Text: addit protagonist medit obstetrician priest care soul confess earli thirteenth centuri ever greater agenc period green ha physician start care woman childbirth increas author midwif green
TEXT:  12–28 and chaps. 1–2).7 Tellingly, however, at a date when the thirteenth century was still young, Anthony’s sermon does not end with the physician priest, but with the penitent, just as the true mother, not Solomon, was put near the center of the Chartres lintel., NR: 793, Book ID: Architecture and the Body by Kim Sexton, Processed Text: chap tellingli howev date thirteenth centuri wa still young sermon doe end physician priest penit true mother wa put near center lintel
TEXT:  In both cases, skin tells the story: ‘On the face of one who is truly penitent’, Anthony says, ‘the pain of contrition is clearly seen, and bitter tears flow as a kind of sweat of the body’. In childbirth, he continues, the baby emerges only after hard labor, parallel to the necessary first phase of contrition after which the satisfaction of penance, he assures his audience, is ‘light and easy’ (Anthony of Padua, 1994, p., NR: 794, Book ID: Architecture and the Body by Kim Sexton, Processed Text: case skin tell stori face one truli penit say pain contrit clearli seen bitter tear flow kind sweat bodi childbirth babi hard labor parallel necessari first phase contrit satisfact penanc audienc light easi

TEXT:  Because confession, unlike birth, is not a one-time event (Kramer, 2015, p. 136), the ‘place’ of the portal is itself perpetually renewed as the site of goings in and comings out (‘inflows’ and ‘outflows,’ in Casey’s words): it is a Janus-like site of decision and commitment, where the skin of the penitent – sensible, sensitive – intersects with the skin of the cathedral in a particularly potent way., NR: 801, Book ID: Architecture and the Body by Kim Sexton, Processed Text: confess unlik birth one time event place portal perpetu site go come inflow outflow word like site decis commit skin penit sensibl sensit skin cathedr particularli potent way

TEXT:  This diverse population thrived here in part because the intention of its founder, the heroic Count Raymond VII of Toulouse (1197–1249), was to create a new town in 1222 that would simultaneously serve to defend his northern border against the French monarchy and also generate revenue for him as he struggled to rebuild his territory after the disruption of the Crusade., NR: 850, Book ID: Architecture and the Body by Kim Sexton, Processed Text: divers popul part intent founder heroic count wa creat new town would simultan serv defend northern border monarchi also gener revenu rebuild territori disrupt crusad

TEXT:  There was one important difference at Cordes, however, from the fortifications at Château Gaillard, as well as from those of similarly sized castra in the south: The 1222 charter of Cordes made it clear that the castrum was to be a market town, and instead of filling the interior of the upper two enceintes, which were the first built, with the bulk of a castle, the count had the four gates aligned so that the town was ordered as though it had a cardo and decumanus., NR: 855, Book ID: Architecture and the Body by Kim Sexton, Processed Text: wa one import differ howev fortif chateau well similarli size castra south charter made clear castrum wa market town instead fill interior upper two first built bulk castl count four gate town wa order though cardo decumanu

TEXT:  The reason for the presence of this remarkable group of buildings may be related to ongoing persecution of families associated with heresy.

TEXT:  The wealth of these families, the absence of major religious institutions, the presence of Cathars, and the local resistance to pressures from the Dominican inquisitors from Albi were all factors, which would have contributed to the public positions and critical content of the crossbred sculptures decorating the facades along the gran carrierira., NR: 860, Book ID: Architecture and the Body by Kim Sexton, Processed Text: wealth famili absenc major religi institut presenc local resist pressur inquisitor factor would public posit critic content crossbr sculptur facad along

TEXT:  1226–1270) and erect life-size statues of the inquisitors in front of its facade. The chapel was built but there is no evidence that the statues were ever made (Rossignol, 1865, p. 10). There are over 200 sculptures on the facades lining the Rue Droite, and the only art historian who has written about them, Michèle Pradalier-Schlumberger, recognized the significance of their number, their workmanship, and their ‘exceptional style’, but described their iconographical content as merely a fantasie décorative (Pradalier-Schlumberger, 2005, p., NR: 862, Book ID: Architecture and the Body by Kim Sexton, Processed Text: erect life size statu inquisitor front facad chapel wa built evid statu ever made sculptur facad line rue art historian ha written signific number workmanship except style iconograph content mere fantasi decor
TEXT:  17). Perhaps because they are part of a small body of work existing on secular buildings, they appear to offer very little basis for comparison.

TEXT:  For the most part the sculptures of Cordes are familiar figures in familiar sizes: animals and vegetation of all kinds, and humans and human heads.

TEXT:  This term has been applied to these and similar figures seen as subversive or as counterpoints to a ‘central’ text, literal representations of the margins of society, and visually inaccessible or self-referential figures such as those seen on corbels, among other things (Camille, 1992; Kenaan-Kedar, 1995)., NR: 865, Book ID: Architecture and the Body by Kim Sexton, Processed Text: term ha appli similar figur seen subvers counterpoint central text liter represent margin societi visual inaccess self referenti figur seen corbel among thing

TEXT:  108). Suspicion of the motives and integrity of high-ranking churchmen in positions of civic authority actually helped spark citizen interest in a range of unauthorized ‘sciences’ such as augury.

TEXT:  In Cordes, these reactions were expressed through letters to authorities as well as through sculptures on the Maison du Grand Veneur that depicted the Dominicans in a negative light. In 1303, the consuls of Cordes wrote a long letter containing nineteen items to King Philip IV enumerating the abuses of the bishop of Albi, Bernard de Castanet, which among other things included a 400 per cent increase in taxes on services for the deceased., NR: 893, Book ID: Architecture and the Body by Kim Sexton, Processed Text: reaction express letter author well sculptur grand neg light consul wrote long letter nineteen item king abus bishop castanet among thing includ per cent increas tax servic deceas
TEXT:  Abuses like these led to a pessimism, which made fortune-telling and magic all the more attractive.

TEXT:  Another science popular in the region was geomancy. A fourteenth-century Occitan treatise on the subject explained how to tell fortunes by a process that combined the use of a psalter and the formation of symbolic ‘houses’ (mayzos), which were associated with signs of the zodiac (Lavaud, 1966, pp., NR: 897, Book ID: Architecture and the Body by Kim Sexton, Processed Text: anoth scienc popular region wa geomanc fourteenth centuri treatis subject tell fortun process combin use psalter format symbol hous associ sign zodiac

Another of the central tenets of the heresy was the acceptance of evil as a power equal to that of good, a concept of duality that even some Catholic treatises accepted (Lavaud, 1966, p. 772).

TEXT:  In a town where sculptures gestured across streets and squares, it is quite possible that sculpted bodies were debating these same issues on the stone façade of the Maison du Gran Ecuyer.

TEXT:  133). Within the ‘circle’ of figures on the façade of the Maison du Grand Ecuyer, evil in the form of the siren is at the center, but forces of good are in powerful positions as well. Two of these figures – the only fully human figures on the façade, and as such, associated with positive qualities – are musicians, and both face the siren with deferent postures., NR: 938, Book ID: Architecture and the Body by Kim Sexton, Processed Text: within circl figur facad grand evil form siren center forc good power posit well two figur fulli human figur facad associ posit qualiti musician face siren defer postur
TEXT:  One, among the largest of sculptures, is placed high on the façade, to the left of the center line (Figure 5.4a; No. 6 on Figure 5.2). This vielle player, which could be male or female, is wearing a long robe and is carved with considerable finesse: in the detail of the pointed toes of the shoes, the decorative elements on the vielle and the folds of the robe., NR: 939, Book ID: Architecture and the Body by Kim Sexton, Processed Text: one among sculptur high facad left center line figur figur viell player could male femal wear long robe consider finess detail point toe shoe decor element viell fold robe
TEXT:  Even the details of the finger knuckles and nails are carved with care.

TEXT:  The other figure, a hooded bagpiper, is found on the same string course line as the siren (Figure 5.4b; No. 14 on Figure 5.2). This fellow is a common man – his breeches are those of a peasant, and he is barefoot, but the sculptor has carved him with as much care as he took with the vielle player., NR: 942, Book ID: Architecture and the Body by Kim Sexton, Processed Text: figur hood bagpip found string cours line siren figur figur fellow common man breech peasant barefoot sculptor ha much care took viell player
TEXT:  Here too we can clearly see his toenails and the pronounced joints of his toes that grip the facade, as well as the knuckles in his fingers. By position and dress, he is subordinate to the vielle player, but by representation and activity he is the equal, a relationship that reflects the porous social strata of Languedoc., NR: 943, Book ID: Architecture and the Body by Kim Sexton, Processed Text: clearli see toenail pronounc joint toe grip facad well knuckl finger posit dress subordin viell player represent activ equal relationship porou social stratum
TEXT:  He too defers to the siren as he bends double toward her, but he also engages our gaze as he simultaneously hunches forward and looks back over his shoulder down toward the street. Figure 5.4 Maison du Grand Ecuyer, (a) (above) vielle player; (b) (below) bagpipe player Photos: (a): author; (b): Pierre Blanc The deferent postures of both these musicians suggest that they are either serenading the siren in tribute, or, on the contrary, suggesting an antidote to evil, promoting to passersby the innocent distractions that were popular in both court and street settings., NR: 944, Book ID: Architecture and the Body by Kim Sexton, Processed Text: siren bend doubl toward also gaze simultan hunch forward look back shoulder toward street figur grand viell player bagpip player photo author blanc defer postur musician suggest either siren tribut contrari suggest antidot evil innoc distract popular court street set
TEXT:  This trio may also have had other associations for medieval viewers familiar with the Roman de la Rose or Bernard Silvestris’ Cosmographia. In that creation myth Silva, a shapeless and chaotic force fashioned by Silvestris from Neoplatonic thought, is calmed with music (Newman, 2003, p., NR: 945, Book ID: Architecture and the Body by Kim Sexton, Processed Text: trio may also associ mediev viewer familiar rose creation myth silva shapeless chaotic forc fashion thought music
TEXT:  58; Stock, 1972, 73). This link would seem more apparent between the vielle player and the siren than between her and the piper, since his peasant dress, posture and proximity to the street suggest that he could be a soliciter as well., NR: 946, Book ID: Architecture and the Body by Kim Sexton, Processed Text: stock link would seem appar viell player siren piper sinc peasant dress postur proxim street suggest could solicit well
TEXT:  His body language is reinforced by two other figures along the lowest string course which also twist to incline toward the vertical center line on which the siren lounges.

TEXT:  The other figure, a hungry dog, walks toward the center with his head turned sideways, gripping a bone in his prominent teeth.

TEXT:  Above the siren sits a roaring lion with a curly mane. He twists his body up and away as though in objection to her evil aura. His posture makes sense since lions in the Middle Ages were noble creatures, the first to be described in bestiaries and almost always associated with honor, courage and ferocity in the face of evil (Salisbury, 1996)., NR: 950, Book ID: Architecture and the Body by Kim Sexton, Processed Text: siren roar lion curli mane twist bodi away though object evil aura postur make sens sinc lion middl age nobl creatur first bestiari almost alway associ honor courag feroc face evil

It appears to be self-absorbed, perhaps besotted with pleasure, or perhaps – in contrast – listening thoughtfully to all the dialogs going on above it with half-closed eyes.

TEXT:  The remaining façade figures emphasize and comment on this vertical center line. The string course on which the siren sits is terminated by an eagle devouring a hare and the bagpipe player (Nos. 12 and 14 on Figure 5., NR: 954, Book ID: Architecture and the Body by Kim Sexton, Processed Text: facad figur emphas comment vertic center line string cours siren eagl devour hare bagpip player figur
TEXT: 2). Both of their bodies arch toward the centerline. The eagle is carved as a powerful, predatory figure, its massive talons completely covering the cowering hare, its beak tearing into the head of the hapless victim, who as a symbol of lust is in good company with the siren., NR: 955, Book ID: Architecture and the Body by Kim Sexton, Processed Text: bodi arch toward eagl power predatori figur massiv talon complet cover hare beak tear head hapless victim symbol lust good compani siren
TEXT:  The eagle, always a noble character, will conquer evil associated with sex as represented by the promiscuous hare. If, on the one hand, the bagpipe player at the other end of the string course represents the music that tames sexual chaos, the siren is ‘contained’ by two figures representing good behavior., NR: 956, Book ID: Architecture and the Body by Kim Sexton, Processed Text: eagl alway nobl charact conquer evil associ sex promiscu hare one hand bagpip player end string cours music sexual chao siren two figur good behavior
TEXT:  On the other hand, if the bagpipe player is encouraging clients to enter the building, the lower string courses are dominated by common or crudely behaving creatures.

TEXT:  The final string course at the spring line of the window arches holds another lion, the vielle player, a cloven-footed harpy and a fragment (Nos. 5, 6, 7 and 8 on Figure 5.2). The lion is seated calmly, projecting strength, and the head of a small figure shows between his front paws, meaning that he has probably defeated an unnamed enemy or vice., NR: 958, Book ID: Architecture and the Body by Kim Sexton, Processed Text: final string cours spring line window arch hold anoth lion viell player cloven foot fragment figur lion seat calmli project strength head small figur show front paw mean ha probabl unnam enemi vice

TEXT:  The harpy may have been the only hybrid in this register, and she may have been placed in her position to provide support to the unquestionably evil figure above and to her right on the diagram. This figure is one of four false gargoyles (called such because they do not function as downspouts) placed just under the eave line which define – or reflect – the centerlines of the window groups below., NR: 960, Book ID: Architecture and the Body by Kim Sexton, Processed Text: may hybrid regist may posit provid support unquestion evil figur right diagram figur one four fals gargoyl function eav line defin reflect window group

TEXT:  They are carved with enough detail for viewers below to differentiate the cloven hooves of the bull from the paws of the lion and the hooves of the horse. These three were noble simply by being fully themselves instead of being depicted as hybrids or other monstrous figures, which was common for gargoyles (Flores, 1996)., NR: 962, Book ID: Architecture and the Body by Kim Sexton, Processed Text: enough detail viewer differenti cloven hoof bull paw lion hoof hors three nobl simpli fulli instead hybrid monstrou figur wa common gargoyl flore
TEXT:  They were noble in their associations as well. Both the horse and bull were domestic animals valued for their service, and the horse was associated with wealth and military prowess. In Cosmographia, Silvestris, borrowing from the Roman author Claudian’s version of the rape of Persephone, promoted the idea that the arts of agriculture were important elements of order that distinguished men from animals (Stock, 1972)., NR: 963, Book ID: Architecture and the Body by Kim Sexton, Processed Text: nobl associ well hors bull domest anim valu servic hors wa associ wealth militari prowess borrow author version rape idea art agricultur import element order distinguish men anim stock

TEXT:  Everything about him suggests savagery: his hybrid form, his aggressive posture and his rough features, which recall those used by Marco Polo to describe the non-European other, such as the ‘savage’ and ‘devilish’ men of Zanzibar (Higgs-Strickland, 2003)., NR: 968, Book ID: Architecture and the Body by Kim Sexton, Processed Text: everyth savageri hybrid form aggress postur rough featur recal use marco polo describ non savag devilish men

TEXT:  157). Similarly, in fourteenth-century Paris, sculptures were used to perform an apotropaic function for shopkeepers and some residents (Camille, 2000). Their efforts to contain evil at the Maison du Grand Ecuyer fail, however, if the central siren is in the most powerful position, and the hybrid fighter escapes the frame to emphasize what is hors normal., NR: 972, Book ID: Architecture and the Body by Kim Sexton, Processed Text: similarli fourteenth centuri sculptur use perform apotropa function shopkeep resid effort contain evil grand fail howev central siren power posit hybrid fighter escap frame emphas normal

TEXT:  Renaissance master Michelangelo Buonarroti’s (1475–1564) Medici Chapel (1521–1534) serves as a compelling case study for the relationship between dissection and art (Figure 6.1). While many know Michelangelo better for his painting and sculpture than for his architecture, his buildings are revered by architectural historians, such as James Ackerman (1986), for their mimicry of bodily motion and emotion, and its many vantage points (pp., NR: 1018, Book ID: Architecture and the Body by Kim Sexton, Processed Text: renaiss master chapel serf compel case studi relationship dissect art figur mani know better paint sculptur architectur build rever architectur historian mimicri bodili motion emot mani vantag point

TEXT:  Early in his career, before designing the Medici Chapel, Michelangelo conducted dissections within the Florentine church of Santo Spirito. According to Ascanio Condivi, author of The Life of Michelangelo (1553), the prior of Santo Spirito allowed Michelangelo to study bodies from the church’s hospital while he was 15 or 16 years old, around the year of 1490 (p., NR: 1033, Book ID: Architecture and the Body by Kim Sexton, Processed Text: earli career design chapel dissect within church accord author life prior studi bodi church hospit wa year old around year

TEXT:  Fundamentally, explorations of the body through dissection were studies in the organization of space (Sawday, 1995, p. 86). Any artist or architect who chose to dissect a body confronted a complex network of volumes, which, as Francis Bacon in The Advancement of Learning (1605) would observe, revealed a wealth of ‘passages and pores … cavities, nests, and receptacles’ (Bacon, trans., NR: 1039, Book ID: Architecture and the Body by Kim Sexton, Processed Text: fundament explor bodi dissect studi organ space artist architect chose dissect bodi complex network volum bacon advanc learn would observ reveal wealth passag pore caviti nest receptacl bacon

Renaissance architect Sebastiano Serlio confirmed a similar notion in his 1537 treatise when he extolled the importance of seeing beneath the surface of the body: [T]hose artists who have seen the skeletons of humans and animals are more skilful [sic] and have a better understanding of the art than those who deal with the subject superficially, only making use of the outward appearance., NR: 1040, Book ID: Architecture and the Body by Kim Sexton, Processed Text: renaiss architect confirm similar notion treatis import see beneath surfac bodi hose artist seen skeleton human anim sic better understand art deal subject superfici make use outward appear

TEXT:  Architectural historian Alina Payne (1999) speaks of an ‘intersection between the sciences of body and building’, stating that ‘the growing scientification of the human body – its analysis and display as a section through a building, layer by layer, mobile joint by mobile joint – had brought about an abstract conception of its parts and their role in the functioning of the whole’ (p., NR: 1046, Book ID: Architecture and the Body by Kim Sexton, Processed Text: architectur historian intersect scienc bodi build grow human bodi analysi display section build layer layer mobil joint mobil joint brought abstract concept part role whole

TEXT:  This led dissection to be associated positively, if counterintuitively, with Christian ideas of penance and redemption (Park, 1994, p. 23). But despite the chance for salvation through dissection, many people did not want to donate their body for medical purposes after death, because they believed they should preserve their corpse’s integrity for judgment Day or for viewing at a funeral (Park, 1994, p., NR: 1051, Book ID: Architecture and the Body by Kim Sexton, Processed Text: led dissect associ posit idea penanc redempt park despit chanc salvat dissect mani peopl want donat bodi medic purpos death preserv corps integr judgment day funer park

TEXT:  The dissection of a lawbreaker’s body acted as a posthumous punishment, and if conducted while the subject was still half alive, the pain served as further castigation.

TEXT:  However, because they both emphasize the soul’s transition, they act as a springboard for interpreting the chapel through the lens of dissection as metaphor.

Burroughs (2001) makes analogous claims in his essay ‘Monuments of Marsyas’, commenting that Michelangelo’s interest in flayed Greek satyr Marsyas was ‘also related, obviously enough, to the exploration of the body by dissection, as practiced fervently by leading Florentine artists, not least Michelangelo’ (p., NR: 1081, Book ID: Architecture and the Body by Kim Sexton, Processed Text: make analog claim essay monument interest satyr wa also relat obvious enough explor bodi dissect practic fervent lead artist least
TEXT:  43). While the two scholars credit, respectively, a devotion to sculpture or a biographical-mythical approach to the commission as the source of the chapel’s fleshy forms, they, like most scholars who have written on Michelangelo’s architecture, do not directly connect the artist’s avid interest in anatomical dissection to his distinctive architectural style in the early sixteenth century., NR: 1082, Book ID: Architecture and the Body by Kim Sexton, Processed Text: two scholar credit respect devot sculptur biograph mythic approach commiss sourc chapel fleshi form like scholar written architectur directli connect artist avid interest anatom dissect distinct architectur style earli sixteenth centuri

TEXT:  Indeed, in the chapel, much like in the body, each visual system has been crafted of its own characteristic material; for example, the pilasters and cornices carved from pietra serena form a structural skeleton, while the Carrara marble acts as veined connective tissue and the plastered white walls perhaps as surgical table sheets., NR: 1086, Book ID: Architecture and the Body by Kim Sexton, Processed Text: inde chapel much like bodi visual system ha characterist materi exampl pilast cornic form structur skeleton marbl act vein connect tissu white wall perhap surgic tabl sheet

TEXT:  Additionally, since Michelangelo gave a high polish to these sculpted scales, they appear wet and slippery, thus conjuring up imagery of bodily fluids and ooze. Surely skin, fluids and bones are all visually experienced during a dissection; by layering these scales into the design of chapel’s bounding walls, Michelangelo provided a blatant hint that the surface of the wall was a composition of flesh and should be interpreted as such., NR: 1099, Book ID: Architecture and the Body by Kim Sexton, Processed Text: addit sinc gave high polish scale appear wet slipperi thu imageri bodili fluid ooz sure skin fluid bone visual experienc dissect scale design chapel bound wall provid blatant hint surfac wall wa composit flesh
TEXT:  When cutting into the body, anatomists must have first confronted the thin layers of skin that covered the density of underlying muscle tissue.

TEXT:  This thin strip of marble makes the surface look as if soft flesh was removed to reveal the tabernacle, much in the same way anatomists remove flesh to reveal the inner spaces of the human body.

TEXT:  For this narrative to live and breathe, the chapel must create a sense of upward movement between the two zones, a task that many observers agree it accomplishes with otherworldly speed.

TEXT:  So, in comparison to the tumultuous lower zone, the features of the upper zone seem distinctly separated and deliberately displayed. Taking the white break in the frieze in conjunction with the vertical movement within the chapel, the complete bio-salvational allegory reads as follows: the bottom zone represents both the tormented earthly existence and the penitent body on the dissection table; the mezzanine, pendentives and dome represent the state of the body postdissection; and, finally, the lantern atop the dome represents the final state of the body, decayed on earth but immortalized as biological knowledge., NR: 1125, Book ID: Architecture and the Body by Kim Sexton, Processed Text: comparison tumultu lower zone featur upper zone seem distinctli deliber display take white break friez conjunct vertic movement within chapel complet salvat allegori read bottom zone torment earthli exist penit bodi dissect tabl mezzanin dome repres state bodi final lantern atop dome final state bodi decay earth biolog knowledg
TEXT:  The chapel’s vertical axis then ties all the elevational zones together, symbolizing the salvific transformation of the human soul – by way of dissection – from tormented, to redeemed, to ecstatic.

The composition of the title plate, attributed to the studio of Titian, perhaps specifically Jan van Calcar (1499–1546), centers on a vertical axis that begins in the womb of a dissected woman and continuing up through the ceiling (Sawday, 1995, p., NR: 1128, Book ID: Architecture and the Body by Kim Sexton, Processed Text: composit titl plate studio titian perhap specif van calcar center vertic axi begin womb dissect woman ceil

In Sawday’s interpretation, this axis represents the drama of life and death; the dissected woman’s womb represents life, and a skeleton suspended just above her represents death (Sawday, 1995, p., NR: 1129, Book ID: Architecture and the Body by Kim Sexton, Processed Text: interpret axi drama life death dissect woman womb life skeleton suspend death
TEXT:  71). The skeleton points the viewer heaven ward along the axis, since it is the only figure that looks upward.

TEXT:  Like Michelangelo’s Medici Chapel entablature, this one also departs from classical convention but it speaks more directly to the anxieties surround the novel practice of scientific dissections. Instead of the white blankness of Michelangelo’s frieze, the title plate’s Doric frieze contains an irregular pattern of symbolic images – a two garlanded bucrania, a cat head and a screaming face., NR: 1131, Book ID: Architecture and the Body by Kim Sexton, Processed Text: like chapel entablatur one also classic convent directli anxieti surround novel practic scientif dissect instead white blank friez titl plate friez irregular pattern symbol imag two cat head scream face
TEXT:  In this way, Vesalius’ artist modified the typical Doric frieze to emphasize the dissection space’s sacrificial quality.

TEXT:  While Vesalius’ artist was working in the two-dimensional medium of print and used the skeleton’s gaze to cause the viewer’s gaze to move upward, Michelangelo played with three-dimensional perspective to create his vertical movement, and the experience of the chapel interior becomes somatic as the viewer’s neck moves to accommodate the view of the dome., NR: 1140, Book ID: Architecture and the Body by Kim Sexton, Processed Text: artist wa work two dimension medium print use skeleton gaze caus viewer gaze move upward three dimension perspect creat vertic movement experi chapel interior becom somat viewer neck move accommod view dome
TEXT:  Where the Vesalius print would not require the viewer’s body to move at all, the visitor’s bodily experience of the Medici Chapel’s verticality might induce an ascending sensation in the visitor. The changes in architectural articulation from lower to upper zones offer a way of relieving psychological discomfort and physically emphasizing dissection’s redemptive role, in which a body atones for its past iniquities when it is sacrificially subjected to the anatomists’ knife., NR: 1141, Book ID: Architecture and the Body by Kim Sexton, Processed Text: print would requir viewer bodi move visitor bodili experi chapel vertic might induc ascend sensat visitor chang architectur articul lower upper zone offer way reliev psycholog discomfort physic dissect redempt role bodi past iniqu sacrifici subject anatomist knife
TEXT:  This vertical, physical movement was uncommon in past burial chapel designs.

TEXT:  Considering the stature of the Medici Chapel in the history of Renaissance architecture, one must wonder if this rather new religio-scientific lens through which to view the symbolic significance of the chapel is limited to this particular commission, or if it is possible that the study of the body’s interior might have participated in revolutionizing Renaissance conceptions of architectural space as much as interest in its exterior form and proportions did., NR: 1144, Book ID: Architecture and the Body by Kim Sexton, Processed Text: consid statur chapel histori renaiss architectur one must wonder rather new scientif len view symbol signific chapel limit particular commiss possibl studi bodi interior might renaiss concept architectur space much interest exterior form proport

TEXT:  In other words, it appears that as anatomists opened bodies for study, architects peered inside and began to emulate the body as a space, rather than deploy it as a ruler.

TEXT:  In a study of ancient thermal resorts at Baiae, Badenweiler, Bath and Pautalia in Bulgaria, Hierapolis at Pamukkale in Tunisia and the Asklepeia at Kos and Pergamon in Greece, Erika Broedner concluded that Roman healing baths did not develop a common typological form because each thermal establishment responded to its individual site, even if they did share certain features such as a large swimming basin, single tub rooms, niches for changing and rest rooms (Broedner, 1983, pp., NR: 1196, Book ID: Architecture and the Body by Kim Sexton, Processed Text: studi ancient thermal resort bath ko erika heal bath develop common typolog form thermal establish individu site even share certain featur larg swim basin singl tub room nich rest room

TEXT:  In cases where municipal laws governing a spa do not survive, the testimony of contemporary visitors is indispensible and, more importantly, reliable.

TEXT:  The legal evidence reveals that open-air thermal spas were viewed as civic squares and policed by similar restrictions. At the baths at Plombieres-les-bains, Montaigne noted seeing a sign posted with the regulations governing the bathing zone, which included prohibitions against the carrying of arms and fighting, consistent with the legal code of the town itself (Montaigne, 1958, p., NR: 1200, Book ID: Architecture and the Body by Kim Sexton, Processed Text: legal evid open air thermal spa civic squar polic similar restrict bath note see sign post regul govern bath zone includ prohibit carri arm fight consist legal code town
TEXT:  10). This was generally the case at all bathing establishments. Other regulations seized upon the notion that bodies were porous organisms and therefore vulnerable to contagion. For example, those suffering from the highly lethal black plague were strictly forbidden from coming anywhere near the baths, and animals and those afflicted with leprosy were also barred from the main basin, or relegated to separate pools (Montaigne, 1958, p., NR: 1201, Book ID: Architecture and the Body by Kim Sexton, Processed Text: wa gener case bath establish regul upon notion bodi porou organ therefor vulner contagion exampl suffer highli lethal black plagu strictli forbidden come anywher near bath anim afflict leprosi also bar main basin separ pool

In shape and dimension, however, the basin resembled that of the baths of Plombières; according to Montaigne: ‘the length of this pond [Bagno Vignoni] is sixty paces, the width thirty-five’ (Montaigne, 1958, p., NR: 1215, Book ID: Architecture and the Body by Kim Sexton, Processed Text: center dozen littl hous thereabout uncomfort disgust around shape dimens howev basin bath accord length pond sixti pace width thirti five
TEXT:  159). But the visual appeal of a spa’s water was clearly important, as it is clear that Montaigne was not impressed with the quality of Vignoni’s water: ‘A large pond surrounded by walls and steps, in the middle of which you see bubbling up several springs of that hot water, which, having no odor of sulphur, little vapor, and a reddish sediment, seems to be rather ferruginous than anything else’ (Montaigne, 1958, p., NR: 1216, Book ID: Architecture and the Body by Kim Sexton, Processed Text: visual appeal spa water wa clearli import clear wa qualiti water larg pond surround wall step middl see bubbl sever spring hot water odor sulphur littl vapor reddish sediment rather ferrugin anyth els
TEXT:  159). Although the healing waters were consumed while in the pool at many spas, as seen in Plombiéres (Figure 7.1) which also had iron-rich water, Montaigne concludes his observations about Vignoni’s water with the terse statement: ‘It is not drunk., NR: 1217, Book ID: Architecture and the Body by Kim Sexton, Processed Text: although heal water pool mani spa seen figur also iron rich water observ water ters statement drunk
TEXT: ’ If not for imbibing, the unattractive waters were nevertheless curative, as Pius II, among other notable Italians, visited the baths for relief from his gout and neuralgia (Mack, 1987, p. 74), and even Montaigne noted that Vignoni was ‘rather well-known’., NR: 1218, Book ID: Architecture and the Body by Kim Sexton, Processed Text: unattract water nevertheless cur among notabl bath relief gout neuralgia mack even note wa rather well known
TEXT: 2 De Balneis and De Thermis indicate the ailments that iron-rich waters could cure. Montaigne, by using the word ‘pond’ for the manmade rectangular pool, suggested that the quality of water could make an entire spa a bit too close to nature, too untamed by civilization, a condition underscored at Vignoni by its ramshackle architectural surroundings., NR: 1219, Book ID: Architecture and the Body by Kim Sexton, Processed Text: indic ailment iron rich water could cure word pond rectangular pool qualiti water could make entir spa bit close natur untam civil condit ramshackl architectur surround

TEXT:  For the patrons, the design of a basin in the Renaissance could have had mythical as well as empirical dimensions. Montaigne describes the basin at Plombières as oval-shaped with the three steps around the entire pool descending into the water (Montaigne, 1958, p., NR: 1232, Book ID: Architecture and the Body by Kim Sexton, Processed Text: patron design basin renaiss could mythic well empir dimens basin oval shape three step around entir pool descend water
TEXT:  9). The De Balneis woodcut only shows steps on one short side of a rectangular pool. One wonders if Montaigne recalled the design of steps correctly or simply associated them with contemporary imagery of the fabled fountain of youth such as that depicted by Lucas Cranach the Elder (1472–1553) in the painting The Fountain of Youth (1546), in which the pool itself is rectangular but has three steps all around it (Figure 7., NR: 1233, Book ID: Architecture and the Body by Kim Sexton, Processed Text: woodcut show step one short side rectangular pool one wonder design step correctli simpli associ contemporari imageri fabl fountain youth elder paint fountain youth pool rectangular ha three step around figur

TEXT:  Inconsistencies in visual materials and written accounts suggest that each depiction is an interpretation of a place, and no one source can be trusted as an accurate portrait. A final mythic note is struck in Plombières with the improbable (at least for eastern France) tall palm tree sprouting at the edge, which could have indicated that the heat of the spring source created an oasis-like microclimate able to sustain subtropical flora., NR: 1235, Book ID: Architecture and the Body by Kim Sexton, Processed Text: inconsist visual materi written account suggest depict interpret place one sourc accur portrait final note struck improb least eastern tall palm tree sprout edg could heat spring sourc oasi like microclim abl sustain subtrop flora
TEXT:  Poggio Bracciolini made similar observations on the mystic and performative aspects of early modern thermal healing sciences, and their implication for bath design.

TEXT:  22–3). During the 1460s, Pius was having his birthplace, formerly known as Corsignano, transformed into the ideal Renaissance city of Pienza inspired by the ideas Leon Battista Alberti (Mack, 1987). Chambers’s hypothesis is plausible, since Pius II did spend so much time at thermal spas on account of his gout and neuralgia that he was known to hold papal court at the baths of Petriolo and Macerata (Mack, 1987, p., NR: 1256, Book ID: Architecture and the Body by Kim Sexton, Processed Text: wa birthplac formerli known ideal renaiss citi inspir idea mack chamber hypothesi plausibl sinc spend much time thermal spa account gout neuralgia wa known hold papal court bath mack

TEXT:  Trained to mirror the well-examined lives led by classical giants like Seneca and Cicero, Montaigne was acutely aware of the inner workings of his body and mind. But, unlike the pilgrims who journeyed to asklepieia for cures in the ancient world, Renaissance patrons of thermal spas like Montaigne and Poggio Bracciolini tended not to view the process through a religious lens so much as in terms of mythic classical tropes such as the fountain of youth (although the Garden of Eden did come to the mind of one observer) (Rapp, 1976)., NR: 1261, Book ID: Architecture and the Body by Kim Sexton, Processed Text: train mirror well life led classic giant like wa acut awar inner work bodi mind unlik pilgrim cure ancient world renaiss patron thermal spa like view process religi len much term classic trope fountain youth although garden come mind one observ

Perhaps their greatest effects were to be had by ‘soaking in’ the atmosphere, the landscape and the quiet space of a spa resort (Tannenbaum, 2011), quite like those that benefitted visitors to the Pergamon Asklepieon featured in Chapter 2., NR: 1264, Book ID: Architecture and the Body by Kim Sexton, Processed Text: long visitor health wa stabl condit slightli bath could certainli harm perhap effect soak atmospher landscap quiet space spa resort quit like visitor featur chapter

TEXT:  This book was an instance of social scientist Hannah Arendt (1906–1975)’s ‘inter homines esse’ – a thing that had the power to convene a public around it (Arendt, 1958, pp. 52–8). Through such objects and, I would argue, buildings, academies could make a bid for inclusion in public life; had they not aspired to inclusion, they would have been mere private clubs (Bronwen and Yachnin, 2010, p., NR: 1315, Book ID: Architecture and the Body by Kim Sexton, Processed Text: book wa instanc social scientist inter thing power conven public around object would argu build academi could make bid inclus public life inclus would mere privat club

TEXT:  Of course, most academies did not meet behind such ‘brazen walls’, one factor that makes it easy to miss the contributions of other academies to space-making in Bologna. Moreover, until the mid-seventeenth century, the city’s academies were aristocratic and noble organisms which, with the exception of Bocchi’s ‘Domus’, would have met in edifices that aggrandized familial patrimony rather than collective interests., NR: 1328, Book ID: Architecture and the Body by Kim Sexton, Processed Text: cours academi meet behind brazen wall one factor make easi miss contribut academi space make moreov mid seventeenth centuri citi academi aristocrat nobl organ except would met edific famili patrimoni rather collect interest

TEXT:  7–8). Despite this demographic shift, members still preferred the residences of high-prestige members as gathering places with a few exceptions (Bergamini, 1988, pp. 40–1). While the design of most of academy meeting places did not allude to the presence of a ‘public’ within their walls, some science academies in Bologna broke the architectural reticence by meeting in residences with telling, visually assertive features, such as the observatory towers or specole on the old Palazzo Davia (on Via Cesare Battisti) and on the Palazzo Marsili (Cavazza, 1990, p., NR: 1330, Book ID: Architecture and the Body by Kim Sexton, Processed Text: despit demograph shift member still prefer resid high prestig member gather place except design academi meet place allud presenc public within wall scienc academi broke architectur retic meet resid tell visual assert featur observatori tower old via
TEXT:  61). Such towers were autonomous urban objects, which citizens, municipal institutions and early modern states were empowered to erect. Any remains of the tower on the Palazzo Davia are today indistinguishable from the rest of the building, but the Palazzo Marsili’s tower is still conspicuous (Figure 8., NR: 1331, Book ID: Architecture and the Body by Kim Sexton, Processed Text: tower autonom urban object citizen municip institut earli modern state erect remain tower today rest build tower still conspicu figur
TEXT: 2). The palazzo of the noble Marsili family was the last home of the Academy of the Unquiet, which had been meeting in different residences since at least 1691 (Cavazza, 1990, 58–61). Designs for the observatory tower were ambitious and obtrusive, a quality to which Marsili’s brother Filippo, a man quite displeased with the idea of hosting the academy in his home, may have alluded when he called the tower a ‘bizarre caprice and money thrown away for fun’., NR: 1332, Book ID: Architecture and the Body by Kim Sexton, Processed Text: nobl famili wa last home academi unquiet meet differ resid sinc least design observatori tower ambiti obtrus qualiti brother filippo man quit displeas idea host academi home may tower bizarr capric money thrown away fun

Marsili’s specola topped the family’s roof terrace, extending out as far as the base was wide, on which an eight- or ten-sided room was erected with large doors, windows and a roof openable in four places, the whole then surmounted by a small tower (torretta)., NR: 1334, Book ID: Architecture and the Body by Kim Sexton, Processed Text: top famili roof terrac extend far base wa wide eight ten side room wa larg door window roof open four place whole surmount small tower

TEXT:  130–1). The tower may or may not have been completed as planned, but Marsili clearly aimed to transform a good portion of his family palazzo into a place where members not only met but worked.

TEXT:  The Assunteria d’Ornato, an organ of city government, which functioned as a design review board, seems to have grown dissatisfied with Torri’s model for the specola; they called for alternative proposals and solicited professional opinions (Ceccarelli and Cervellati, 1987, p., NR: 1342, Book ID: Architecture and the Body by Kim Sexton, Processed Text: organ citi govern design review board grown dissatisfi model altern propos solicit profession opinion
TEXT:  22). From this drawn-out process, the remarks of architect Fernando Galli Bibiena (1657–1743), made in 1722, contain some revealing analogies, as he judged one design to bear a strong resemblance to a ‘fortified tower of old’ (‘una Torre Fortelicia all’uso antico’) and another to be ‘lighter’ and rather like a ‘civil tower’ or ‘campanile’ (Malagola, 1875, pp., NR: 1343, Book ID: Architecture and the Body by Kim Sexton, Processed Text: drawn process remark architect made contain reveal analog one design bear strong resembl tower old anoth lighter rather like civil tower campanil

TEXT:  With or without actual views into Galli’s school, his contemporaries were already assimilating the academy’s meeting place to a uterus. In 1755, in praising Galli’s revolutionary use of tools and objects to ‘open’ the female body to the eyes and hands of his pupils, philosopher and scientist Francesco Maria Zanotti (1692–1777) sexed Galli’s private residence as an ‘enclosed space dedicated to the female uterus’, redundantly reiterating ‘female’, and re-emphasizing the identification of the school with house in concluding that this ‘most illustrious school of [his] house was dedicated to begetting’ (Zanotti, 1755, p., NR: 1387, Book ID: Architecture and the Body by Kim Sexton, Processed Text: without actual view school contemporari alreadi academi meet place uteru prais revolutionari use tool object open femal bodi eye hand pupil philosoph scientist maria sex privat resid space femal uteru redundantli femal identif school hous conclud illustri school hous wa

TEXT:  Leon Battista Alberti (1444–1472), for instance, conceived of walls as having inner and outer cortices, that is, skins, in other words, facing or revetment, between which were infills (infarcinamenta), the strongest of which regular masonry (‘bones’ or ossa) in contrast to small stone chips (De re aedificatoria, 3., NR: 1392, Book ID: Architecture and the Body by Kim Sexton, Processed Text: instanc wall inner outer cortex skin word face revet regular masonri bone os contrast small stone chip

Michelangelo, ahead of his time as he so often was, stands as an exception to this trend (cf.

TEXT: 9 The eye of modernity Form, proportion and rhythm in German architectural history of the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries Tobias Teutenberg The playground of the modern eye ‘The ultimate essence of modernity is psychologism, the experience and interpretation of the world according to the reactions of our interior being – essentially as an interior world – the dissolution of solid content into the liquid element of the soul, out of which all substance is derived, and whose shapes are merely forms of movement’ (Simmel, 1909, p., NR: 1433, Book ID: Architecture and the Body by Kim Sexton, Processed Text: eye modern form proport rhythm german architectur histori nineteenth earli twentieth centuri playground modern eye ultim essenc modern psycholog experi interpret world accord reaction interior essenti interior world dissolut solid content liquid element soul substanc deriv whose shape mere form movement
TEXT:  183).1 Georg Simmel’s (1858–1918) concise definition of modernity was also a description of the leading style of perception at the turn of the twentieth century. The well-known sociologist and cultural philosopher understood this to consist of the programmatic psychologizing of phenomena and the systematic giving of dynamism to reality., NR: 1434, Book ID: Architecture and the Body by Kim Sexton, Processed Text: concis definit modern wa also descript lead style percept turn twentieth centuri well known sociologist cultur philosoph understood consist programmat phenomenon systemat give dynam realiti
TEXT:  When published in 1909 in his essay on Auguste Rodin, Simmel’s words reflected the characteristics of the visual culture surrounding him, while at the same time recognizing this culture’s formal signature in the heavily movement-emphasizing postures and surfaces of Rodin’s sculptures., NR: 1435, Book ID: Architecture and the Body by Kim Sexton, Processed Text: essay word reflect characterist visual cultur surround time cultur formal signatur heavili movement postur surfac sculptur
TEXT:  Simmel’s view of Rodin’s work was naturally deeply influenced by the culture in which he found himself, just as it had also been for previous Rodin interpreters who read the very same artworks as manifestations of late Romanticism, anti-modernity or even postmodernity (Brabant, 2017)., NR: 1436, Book ID: Architecture and the Body by Kim Sexton, Processed Text: view work wa natur deepli cultur found also previou interpret read manifest late romantic anti modern even brabant
TEXT:  Disagreements over the meaning of Rodin’s formal language make very clear how differently the same object can be viewed and critiqued in the course of history. This leads to the theory that historical descriptions of pictures, sculptures, architecture and other phenomena of the everyday world give insights into the dominant styles of perception of their era, which are shaped by factors both within and without the broad disciplinary borders of art history, such as the optical and circulatory sciences., NR: 1437, Book ID: Architecture and the Body by Kim Sexton, Processed Text: disagr mean formal languag make clear differ object cours histori lead theori histor descript pictur sculptur architectur phenomenon everyday world give insight domin style percept era shape factor within without broad disciplinari border art histori optic circulatori scienc

TEXT:  However, in comparison to Simmel their main focus is not on modern sculpture but on objects, pictures and buildings from all classical epochs in art history. Yet, all of the descriptions are related to a common observational technique, which indicates the presence of a collective visual style in German art history around 1900., NR: 1439, Book ID: Architecture and the Body by Kim Sexton, Processed Text: howev comparison main focu modern sculptur object pictur build classic epoch art histori yet descript relat common observ techniqu presenc collect visual style german art histori around
TEXT:  This common mode of seeing has its origins in contemporary scientific theories of perception which, in turn, change and evolve according to new understandings of physiology and psychology.

TEXT:  At the turn of the twentieth century, a key filter was dynamism, specifically recognizable through the prominence of the notion of rhythm (Blümle, 2014; Schneider, 1992).

TEXT: g., Anschauungsunterricht or observation instruction) and drawing education, where the systemization and rationalizing of the act of seeing was actively cultivated.2 The influence of this visual regime was such that the educated human eye could join forces with advances in other scientific disciplines, such as botany, to produce unexpected new knowledge in historical architecture., NR: 1443, Book ID: Architecture and the Body by Kim Sexton, Processed Text: observ instruct draw educ system act see wa activ cultiv influenc visual regim wa educ human eye could join forc advanc scientif disciplin botani produc unexpect new knowledg histor architectur
TEXT:  With the appearance of rhythm in German art history around 1900 those long-established visual styles became slowly outdated, but that is not to say that rhythm simply and entirely wiped out the former conventions of detached, ocular-centric observation, but rather grew alongside and incorporated them, before eventually overruling them., NR: 1444, Book ID: Architecture and the Body by Kim Sexton, Processed Text: appear rhythm german art histori around long establish visual style slowli outdat say rhythm simpli entir former convent detach ocular centric observ rather grew alongsid incorpor eventu overrul
TEXT:  Visual education and visual culture in nineteenth-century Germany In the nineteenth century, diverse disciplinary fields came to prefer certain styles and methods of observation.

TEXT:  44). Nevertheless, one highly influential area within Germany’s visual culture of the nineteenth century has largely been ignored: drawing education (Heilmann et al., 2014 and 2015; Ashwin, 1981). Zurich social and educational reformer Johann Heinrich Pestalozzi (1746–1827) was one of the field’s great innovators in that his ideas and methods gave unfettered precedence to the rationalization of the eye., NR: 1448, Book ID: Architecture and the Body by Kim Sexton, Processed Text: nevertheless one highli influenti area within visual cultur nineteenth centuri ha larg draw educ social educ reform wa one field great innov idea method gave unfett preced ration eye
TEXT:  His general approach was on the one hand influenced by traditional observational techniques of the natural sciences dealing with the systematic fragmentation of objects to their basic elements. Those long-established epistemological methods have been summarized a few decades earlier by the Swiss botanist Jean Senebier in his publication Die Kunst zu beobachten (The Art of Observing) from 1776., NR: 1449, Book ID: Architecture and the Body by Kim Sexton, Processed Text: gener approach wa one hand tradit observ techniqu natur scienc deal systemat fragment object basic element long establish epistemolog method decad swiss botanist jean public die art observ
TEXT:  On the other hand, it is obvious that late eighteenth-century drawing books with their focus on the contour and geometry of the human body offered inspiration to him. The core of Pestalozzi’s doctrine centered around a variety of exercises in observation and drawing with the primary goal of adjusting the students’ visual perception of the world around them in such a way that they were capable of reducing the objects being observed down to their basic geometric shapes and mathematical relationships, as a contemporary graphic illustrates (Figure 9., NR: 1450, Book ID: Architecture and the Body by Kim Sexton, Processed Text: hand obviou late eighteenth centuri draw book focu contour geometri human bodi inspir core doctrin center around varieti exercis observ draw primari goal student visual percept world around way capabl reduc object basic geometr shape mathemat relationship contemporari graphic figur
TEXT: 1a). The teacher sits in a classroom of roughly 80 students, gesticulating with his right hand in order to initiate the act of measurement in relation to the body of a student standing to his left. To complete their assignment, the children should imagine a square – in Pestalozzi’s theory the archetype of all mathematical forms – positioned between themselves and their comrade, thereby enabling them to define the basic shapes and proportions, which make up the body of the boy., NR: 1451, Book ID: Architecture and the Body by Kim Sexton, Processed Text: teacher classroom roughli student right hand order initi act measur relat bodi student stand left complet assign child imagin squar theori archetyp mathemat form posit comrad therebi defin basic shape proport make bodi boy
TEXT:  The ultimate aim of this process was to convert the previously unrefined observational faculties of his students into a skilled talent of perception undergirded by well-defined rules referred to by Pestalozzi as Anschauungskunst, that is, the art of observation (Teutenberg, 2016, pp., NR: 1452, Book ID: Architecture and the Body by Kim Sexton, Processed Text: ultim aim process wa convert previous unrefin observ faculti student skill talent percept well defin rule art observ
TEXT:  150–3). The reduction of the body to geometric shapes is tantalizing similar to the figures on Archaic Greek vases (Figure 1.3), but, as Chang explains in Chapter 1, in Antiquity geometrization was supposed to reveal the joints and articulation of the human body, or its undoing, whereas in the nineteenth-century geometry and proportion signified the (assumingly) reasonable order of nature and the human capacity to comprehend it., NR: 1453, Book ID: Architecture and the Body by Kim Sexton, Processed Text: reduct bodi geometr shape similar figur archaic va figur chang chapter antiqu wa suppos reveal joint articul human bodi undo wherea nineteenth centuri geometri proport assumingli reason order natur human capac comprehend
TEXT:  Pestalozzi’s teaching method became widespread and influential in Prussia (Oelkers and Ostenwalder, 1995), as Wilhelm von Humboldt (1767–1835) set up his own institutes in Pestalozzi’s mould in order to teach the desired method to the offspring of the social elite as well as new generations of teachers., NR: 1454, Book ID: Architecture and the Body by Kim Sexton, Processed Text: teach method widespread influenti set institut mould order teach desir method offspr social elit well new gener teacher
TEXT:  From these beginnings, a dense, robust network of Pestalozzi-followers flourished in Germany, inspiring theorists like Friedrich Herbart (1776–1841) and Friedrich Fröbel (1782–1852) who advocated similar observational methods but with alternate geometries (e., NR: 1455, Book ID: Architecture and the Body by Kim Sexton, Processed Text: begin dens robust network follow inspir theorist like similar observ method altern geometri

It was only in the Art-Education Movement (Kunsterziehungs bewegung) around 1900 that the rigid formalistic approach of drawing education along with much of the instrumental reasoning of nineteenth-century education triggered heavy criticism., NR: 1459, Book ID: Architecture and the Body by Kim Sexton, Processed Text: wa art educ movement around rigid formalist approach draw educ along much instrument reason nineteenth centuri educ trigger heavi critic
TEXT:  Ophthalmologists blamed the method for damaging for the eye (Gräber, 1880), and developmental psychologists (Sully, 1895) found it psychologically unsuitable for children.

TEXT:  By the 1830s, art historians had begun to embrace empiricism and consequently the need to observe the form of artworks and architecture carefully.

TEXT:  Among the publications to fulfill the new empiricist objectives was the first text on the theory of (neo-) Gothic architecture by landscape architect Johann Christian Metzger (1789–1852): his essay Gesetze der Pflanzen- und Mineralienbildung angewendet auf den altdeutschen Baustyl (Principles of the Formation of Plants and Minerals Applied on the Old German Building Style) from 1835., NR: 1465, Book ID: Architecture and the Body by Kim Sexton, Processed Text: among public fulfil new empiricist object wa first text theori neo architectur landscap architect essay den principl format plant miner appli old german build style
TEXT:  Metzger was a well-known expert on landscape design as well as the author of popular books on the cultivation of wine, fruit and vegetables, all of which show the pedagogic influence of Pestalozzi as well as the advances made by naturalists such as Karl Rudolphi (1771–1832) (Scheidle, 2008, p., NR: 1466, Book ID: Architecture and the Body by Kim Sexton, Processed Text: wa well known expert landscap design well author popular book cultiv wine fruit veget show pedagog influenc well advanc made naturalist
TEXT:  72). Metzger was not only highly familiar with the educational debates of the time but, – as an architect, – he enjoyed a thorough drawing education. Not surprisingly, the basic concepts in his essay bear the stamp of the observational method and the visual techniques of pedagogy of the time., NR: 1467, Book ID: Architecture and the Body by Kim Sexton, Processed Text: wa highli familiar educ debat time architect thorough draw educ surprisingli basic concept essay bear stamp observ method visual techniqu pedagogi time
TEXT:  The self-professed aim of his essay was nothing less than ‘to establish a law, which appears to have been observed by our elders in the form of plants and minerals, and which they may subsequently have applied within their designs for buildings, in particular with so-called Gothic structures’ (Metzger, 1835, III; trans., NR: 1468, Book ID: Architecture and the Body by Kim Sexton, Processed Text: self profess aim essay wa noth less establish law elder form plant miner may subsequ appli within design build particular structur
TEXT:  by author). According to Metzger, this supposedly universal principle was first discovered by medieval Bauhütten (masons’ lodges) – an institution romanticized and ‘modernized’ in the nineteenth century to the point where it was believed that lodges were interdisciplinary groups of skilled workers among whom were builders, natural scientists and mathematicians., NR: 1469, Book ID: Architecture and the Body by Kim Sexton, Processed Text: author accord supposedli univers principl wa first discov mediev mason lodg institut nineteenth centuri point wa lodg group skill worker among builder natur scientist mathematician
TEXT:  These networks were said to have shared their own highly evolved ideas on the development of architecture exclusively by word-of-mouth, but this secret knowledge had been lost as a result of the Bauhütten’s demise in the early modern period., NR: 1470, Book ID: Architecture and the Body by Kim Sexton, Processed Text: network said highli idea develop architectur exclus word mouth secret knowledg lost result demis earli modern period
TEXT:  However, as a result of analytic observation, Metzger had ‘noticed characteristics of old buildings which appear to shed new light on the topic’ (Metzger, 1835, VI). These characteristics centered around the so-called technique of circle graduation, whereby circles could be deconstructed into geometrically accurate, equally proportioned segments., NR: 1471, Book ID: Architecture and the Body by Kim Sexton, Processed Text: howev result analyt observ characterist old build appear shed new light topic characterist center around techniqu circl graduat wherebi circl could geometr accur equal proport segment
TEXT:  Metzger had first observed this principle in the world of botany, more specifically, in the flowering of trees as well as in the organization of their seedpods, stems and leaves (Figure 9.2a). According to him, it is clear from nature how the geometric shape of the circle is formed and how it can be divided by two to six lines in halves, thirds, fourths, fifths and sixths of 180°, 120°, 90°, 72°, and 60°, respectively., NR: 1472, Book ID: Architecture and the Body by Kim Sexton, Processed Text: first principl world botani specif flower tree well organ stem leaf figur accord clear natur geometr shape circl form divid two six line half third fourth fifth sixth respect
TEXT:  Assuming that geometry was fundamental to architecture, Metzger proposed that many buildings of the Middle Ages had been built on this general law of nature. He found evidence for this in his hometown, more specifically in a small sculpture over the entrance to the Ruprecht building of Heidelberg Castle (Figure 9., NR: 1473, Book ID: Architecture and the Body by Kim Sexton, Processed Text: assum geometri wa fundament architectur mani build middl age built gener law natur found evid specif small sculptur entranc build castl figur
TEXT: 2b). The shield shows two angels holding a wreath of leaves in their hands ‘in which there are five equidistant five-petalled roses’. Furthermore, one of the angels is holding a large compass with his right hand ‘which is seated in the wreath’ (Metzger, 1835, p., NR: 1474, Book ID: Architecture and the Body by Kim Sexton, Processed Text: shield show two angel hold wreath leaf hand five equidist five petal rose furthermor one angel hold larg compass right hand seat wreath
TEXT:  13). Metzger saw in this a five-way division of the circle and thus declared the work as evidence that the design of the whole structure is based on the natural law of circle division. And, indeed, the suggestion was not as far-fetched as it may seem: According to Metzger, the axes of the pointed-arch portal at the front of the building lie at angles of 72° to each other and thus were also proportioned by the five-way division of the circle., NR: 1475, Book ID: Architecture and the Body by Kim Sexton, Processed Text: saw five way divis circl thu declar work evid design whole structur base natur law circl divis inde suggest wa far fetch may seem accord ax point arch portal front build lie angl thu also proport five way divis circl
TEXT:  Encouraged by this result, the architect started to analyze several more mediaeval structures in Heidelberg, among them the Gothic Heiliggeistkirche.

TEXT:  A few years earlier, for instance, the architectural historian from Leipzig Christian Ludwig Stieglitz (1756–1836) was already of the opinion that the square was the decisive shape within the Gothic style and not the circle (Stieglitz, 1829) and in fact, a whole host of closely related publications shows how his form-analytic visual style was a common pursuit, as seen, for example, in Carl Alexander von Heideloff’s four-part Der kleine Altdeutsche (Gothe) oder Grundzüge des altdeutschen Baustyles (The Little Old German (Goth) or the Foundations of the Old German Building Style) of 1849–1852 and in Friedrich Hoffstadt’s seven-part Gothisches A., NR: 1478, Book ID: Architecture and the Body by Kim Sexton, Processed Text: year instanc architectur historian wa alreadi opinion squar wa decis shape within style circl fact whole host close relat public show form analyt visual style wa common pursuit seen exampl carl four part de littl old german foundat old german build style seven part

TEXT:  It was only in the twentieth century that this analytical approach to the observation of form and mathematical proportions (Form- und Maßforschung) came to be criticized. Rudolf Wittkower (1901–1971), for instance, came to the conclusion that the epistemic value of such research was in fact quite limited (Wittkower, 1949) and many later art historians – among them the author of this essay – share his opinion on this topic., NR: 1481, Book ID: Architecture and the Body by Kim Sexton, Processed Text: wa twentieth centuri analyt approach observ form mathemat proport form came instanc came conclus epistem valu research wa fact quit limit mani later art historian among author essay share opinion topic
TEXT:  But the value and acceptance of Form- und Maßforschung in the context of nineteenth-century German art and architectural history was nonetheless enormous. As a historical phenomenon, the rise in popularity of this research style can only be comprehended if one understands it as a reaction to the new standards of rational observation as developed by pedagogy, spread by drawing education and coupled with the emerging sciences., NR: 1482, Book ID: Architecture and the Body by Kim Sexton, Processed Text: valu accept form context nineteenth centuri german art architectur histori wa nonetheless enorm histor phenomenon rise popular research style one reaction new standard ration observ pedagogi spread draw educ coupl scienc

TEXT:  The earliest evocation of architectural rhythm in German art history can be found in Heinrich Wölfflin’s (1864–1945) dissertation Prolegomena zu einer Psychologie der Architektur of 1886, in which the Swiss art historian likens rhythm in architecture to the pulse of the human heart., NR: 1487, Book ID: Architecture and the Body by Kim Sexton, Processed Text: evoc architectur rhythm german art histori found dissert prolegomenon swiss art historian rhythm architectur puls human heart
TEXT: 5 Inspired by Robert Vischer’s (1847–1933) doctoral thesis in which the aesthetic effect of optical rhythms is explained in terms of empathy or Einfühlungstheorie (Vischer, 1873, p. 8), Wölfflin’s text very carefully attempts to apply the principles of rhythm as found in the temporal arts like music and poetry to the realm of spatial arts like architecture., NR: 1488, Book ID: Architecture and the Body by Kim Sexton, Processed Text: inspir doctor thesi aesthet effect optic rhythm term empathi text care attempt appli principl rhythm found tempor art like music poetri realm spatial art like architectur
TEXT:  He did, however, stop short of declaring rhythm to be one of his four laws of form (Formgesetze) – namely, regularity, symmetry, proportion and harmony.

TEXT:  Michael’s Church at Hildesheim (1010–1031). In the steady change from columns to pillars in the nave of the church he observed ‘a sequence of distinct parts, and therefore a sense of pulse’, and he queried, ‘Why should a rhythm not be created through emphasis of the second and third parts?’ (1999, pp., NR: 1490, Book ID: Architecture and the Body by Kim Sexton, Processed Text: church steadi chang column pillar nave church sequenc distinct part therefor sens puls rhythm emphasi second third part
TEXT:  31–2). For Wölfflin, this was reason enough to think about the relevance of rhythm for his discussions around architectural phenomena. He came to several conclusions on the subject. The first was that various examples from historical architecture clearly demonstrate that architects had relied on the stimulating effect of rhythm in ever greater ways since late antiquity., NR: 1491, Book ID: Architecture and the Body by Kim Sexton, Processed Text: wa reason enough think relev rhythm discuss around architectur phenomenon came sever conclus subject first wa variou exampl histor architectur clearli demonstr architect effect rhythm ever greater way sinc late antiqu
TEXT:  Second, this in turn had led such buildings to have a special aesthetic characteristic, as if ‘through the effect of waves of rhythm crashing down upon us, we are taken, drawn in to the beautiful movement, everything which is formless dissolves, and we enjoy a sense of freedom, of weightlessness for a few moments’ (Wölfflin, 1999, p., NR: 1492, Book ID: Architecture and the Body by Kim Sexton, Processed Text: second turn led build special aesthet characterist effect wave rhythm upon taken drawn beauti movement everyth formless dissolv enjoy sens freedom weightless moment

Hence, from the intimate sensation of the ‘feel’ of the pulse within the body, the rhythms of architecture perceived by the eyes lead the beholder to a unique, disembodied experience of built form., NR: 1493, Book ID: Architecture and the Body by Kim Sexton, Processed Text: henc intim sensat feel puls within bodi rhythm architectur eye lead behold uniqu experi built form
TEXT:  Finally, in order to establish the observer’s ability to recognize rhythmic forms in architecture and to appreciate their aesthetic character, Wölfflin sets out a third and final thesis relating to organic functions of the human body such as breathing and pulse., NR: 1494, Book ID: Architecture and the Body by Kim Sexton, Processed Text: final order establish observ abil recogn rhythmic form architectur appreci aesthet charact set third final thesi organ function human bodi breath puls

TEXT:  Subsequent research has firmly established Wölfflin as someone highly influenced by contemporary theories of the organization of the human body (Maskarinec, 2014). Yet, his Prolegomena accomplished another important step in terms of architectural research: it established the choreographic interpretation of structures, which from this point on became an evermore consequential concept., NR: 1497, Book ID: Architecture and the Body by Kim Sexton, Processed Text: subsequ research ha firmli establish someon highli contemporari theori organ human bodi yet prolegomenon accomplish anoth import step term architectur research establish choreograph interpret structur point evermor consequenti concept
TEXT:  The influence of this approach was nurtured, but transformed, in no small part by August Schmarsow (1853–1936), a professor of art history in Leipzig, and, before him, by Alois Riegl (1858–1905).6 Schmarsow’s first involvement with the principle of rhythm appeared in a talk he gave in 1896, in which he famously defined architecture as a Raumgestalterin, a space-maker or literally a ‘creatress of space’ (Schmarsow, 1896, p., NR: 1498, Book ID: Architecture and the Body by Kim Sexton, Processed Text: influenc approach wa small part august professor art histori first involv principl rhythm talk gave famous defin architectur space maker liter creatress space
TEXT:  44). This space-giver establishes her own creations on the basis of the human physiology, whereas Wölfflin had focused on architecture’s solid bodily form. But, like Wölfflin, Schmarsow found rhythm to be a basic ingredient in his own spatio-anthropomorphic understanding of architecture., NR: 1499, Book ID: Architecture and the Body by Kim Sexton, Processed Text: space giver creation basi human physiolog wherea architectur solid bodili form like found rhythm basic ingredi anthropomorph understand architectur
TEXT:  In his formulation, the body informed three core principles: ‘in the first dimension, proportionality prevails; in the second, symmetry; and in the third, the element […] of rhythm’ (Schmarsow, 1896, p., NR: 1500, Book ID: Architecture and the Body by Kim Sexton, Processed Text: formul bodi inform three core principl first dimens proportion second symmetri third element rhythm
TEXT:  59). The three terms allude to an older architectural theory, that of Gottfried Semper (1803–1879), and its main terms – eurhythmy, proportionality and symmetry – not least because both researchers defined their three aesthetic laws in terms of the physical makeup of man., NR: 1501, Book ID: Architecture and the Body by Kim Sexton, Processed Text: three term allud older architectur theori main term proportion symmetri least research defin three aesthet law term physic man
TEXT: 7 Unlike Semper, however, Schmarsow emphasized the superiority of rhythm over the other two. For him, it was the ultimate principle of design in architecture since its playground was exclusively the third dimension, namely depth, in which he saw the ‘lifeline of every spatial formation’ (Schmarsow, 1896, p., NR: 1502, Book ID: Architecture and the Body by Kim Sexton, Processed Text: unlik howev superior rhythm two wa ultim principl design architectur sinc playground wa exclus third dimens name depth saw lifelin everi spatial format
TEXT:  58). Unlike proportionality and symmetry, however, rhythm was not evoked by static mathematical ratios and geometric shapes; instead, in Schmarsow’s opinion, rhythm was a purely psychological principle in that it effected a viewer’s perception of space., NR: 1503, Book ID: Architecture and the Body by Kim Sexton, Processed Text: unlik proportion symmetri howev rhythm wa static mathemat ratio geometr shape instead opinion rhythm wa pure psycholog principl viewer percept space
TEXT:  As a person walks forward in a rhythmic sequence of steps, he or she thereby builds up a rhythmic series of perceptual impressions which create – in a subtle way – an awareness of a space’s totality. Current research into the motor function of the human body has justified Schmarsow’s stance that beholders on the move are developing rhythmic impressions of architectural forms and spaces automatically., NR: 1504, Book ID: Architecture and the Body by Kim Sexton, Processed Text: person walk forward rhythmic sequenc step therebi build rhythmic seri perceptu impress creat subtl way awar space total current research motor function human bodi ha stanc behold move rhythmic impress architectur form space automat
TEXT:  For instance, researchers from the anatomy department at Leipzig University, such as Christian Wilhelm Braune (1831–1892) and Otto Fischer (1861–1916), had already started work on what was later to become the six-volume publication Der Gang des Menschen (The Human Gait) (1895–1904), which established the rhythmic nature of human walking with the help of chronophotography (Figure 9., NR: 1505, Book ID: Architecture and the Body by Kim Sexton, Processed Text: instanc research anatomi depart univers otto alreadi work wa later becom six volum public gang de human gait establish rhythmic natur human walk help figur
TEXT: 3a). But Schmarsow took inspiration from psychological studies as well (Mainberger, 2010, pp. 91–110; Golston, 2008, pp. 12–29). Pioneered in the second half of the nineteenth century by researchers such as Ernst Mach (1838–1916) and Ernst Meumann (1862–1915), psychoacoustics established the theory that humans by their very nature tend to subjectively hear rhythmic patterns among similar sequences of sounds., NR: 1506, Book ID: Architecture and the Body by Kim Sexton, Processed Text: took inspir psycholog studi well second half nineteenth centuri research establish theori human natur tend subject hear rhythmic pattern among similar sequenc sound
TEXT:  Furthermore, the nascent field of Gestalt psychology held that the human mind tended to perceive whole systems rather than focus on small parts even when evidence for the whole was not manifest. Father of the discipline Christian von Ehrenfels (1859–1932) had already identified rhythm as one of these systems by 1890, observing that, regardless of whether the elements of a rhythmic sequence ‘are marked by changes in volume, obvious movement, pressure or otherwise’, they are always leading to the same rhythmic form in the consciousness of the human beholders (Ehrenfels, 1890, p., NR: 1507, Book ID: Architecture and the Body by Kim Sexton, Processed Text: furthermor nascent field psycholog human mind perceiv whole system rather focu small part even evid whole wa manifest father disciplin alreadi rhythm one system observ regardless whether element rhythmic sequenc mark chang volum obviou movement pressur otherwis alway lead rhythmic form conscious human behold

TEXT:  Against this epistemic background, the early nineteenth-century predilection for observing an object’s geometric building blocks and proportions played a largely inconsequential role.

TEXT:  They were mere partitioning elements within the fluid medium of time, uprooted by the overwhelming flow of rhythm like tree trunks on an untamed mountain river (Schmarsow, 1998, p. 91).

TEXT:  The focus on formal factors such as basic shapes and proportions is still present in both, yet a cinematographic reading of architecture is also present with its focus on rhythmic movements. A number of application-oriented studies on architectural rhythm soon followed, notably those of medievalist Wilhelm Pinder (Bushart, 2007, pp., NR: 1511, Book ID: Architecture and the Body by Kim Sexton, Processed Text: focu formal factor basic shape proport still present yet cinematograph read architectur also present focu rhythmic movement number applic studi architectur rhythm soon notabl medievalist pinder
TEXT:  169–72). A student of Schmarsow, Pinder attempted to understand the development of rhythmic ‘grouping principles’ (Gruppierungsgrundsätze) in Norman Romanesque architecture (Pinder, 1904, p. 1). He accepted his mentor’s premise that viewers inevitably observe architectural forms as temporal rhythmic organizations on account of their own psychophysical constitutions., NR: 1512, Book ID: Architecture and the Body by Kim Sexton, Processed Text: student pinder understand develop rhythmic group principl architectur pinder accept mentor premis viewer inevit observ architectur form tempor rhythmic organ account psychophys constitut
TEXT:  However, even more important for Pinder was the fact that the bodies of artists and builders themselves are rhythmically organized.

TEXT:  In the practical portion of the study, Pinder examined how the different rooms of a basilica might engender and guide the formation of a rhythm within the eye and body of its beholder. The oldest building considered was the late Carolingian cathedral of Beauvais, the so-called Basse Oeurvre located at the foot of the present-day Gothic choir (Figure 9., NR: 1515, Book ID: Architecture and the Body by Kim Sexton, Processed Text: practic portion studi pinder differ room basilica might engend guid format rhythm within eye bodi behold build consid wa late cathedr foot present day choir figur
TEXT: 3b). In the book, he painstakingly details all the forms and proportions of the church in over 17 pages of text. Pinder then tries to understand ‘what information is to be found within the building […] to be received by the viewer’s senses’ (Pinder, 1904, p., NR: 1516, Book ID: Architecture and the Body by Kim Sexton, Processed Text: book painstakingli detail form proport church page text pinder tri understand inform found within build receiv viewer pinder
TEXT:  21). To this end, he places an imaginary viewer on the central axis of the nave and allows him to walk towards the choir and thereby emphasizes the importance of the pillars to the rhythmic impression of Beauvais’ space: ‘The man walks along and there is a regular alternation of feeling in him: from that of being close to a body to that of having a heavy weight lifted […]., NR: 1517, Book ID: Architecture and the Body by Kim Sexton, Processed Text: end place imaginari viewer central axi nave walk toward choir therebi import pillar rhythmic impress space man walk along regular altern feel close bodi heavi weight
TEXT:  This switching of emotions in an alternating sequence is a simple form of rhythm’ (Pinder, 1904, p. 22; trans. by author). He finds that this impression is supported by other factors, such as the momentum of the nave arches or the regular pattern of the windows in the clerestory., NR: 1518, Book ID: Architecture and the Body by Kim Sexton, Processed Text: switch emot altern sequenc simpl form rhythm pinder author find impress factor momentum nave arch regular pattern window clerestori
TEXT:  Absent in the Basse Oeuvre, however, are strong vertical accents which, in many Romanesque and most Gothic churches, were provided by slim responds and huge pillars. Hence, the rhythmic energy of Beauvais’ late Carolingian basilica stays comparatively low but, as a starting point for Pinder’s extensive studies on the history of rhythm in medieval Norman architecture, the church plays nonetheless an essential role nonetheless., NR: 1519, Book ID: Architecture and the Body by Kim Sexton, Processed Text: absent howev strong vertic accent mani church provid slim huge pillar henc rhythmic energi late basilica stay compar low start point pinder extens studi histori rhythm mediev architectur church play nonetheless essenti role nonetheless

TEXT:  The architect of this multipurpose building, which included an institution for rhythmic education, was the hitherto largely unknown reform-architect Heinrich Tessenow (1876–1950). However, it was the Geneva music educator Émile Jaques-Dalcroze (1865–1950) and the Berne stage reformer Adolphe Appia (1862–1928) who were responsible for the design at a conceptual level (Beacham 2006, pp., NR: 1525, Book ID: Architecture and the Body by Kim Sexton, Processed Text: architect build includ institut rhythmic educ wa hitherto larg unknown reform architect howev wa geneva music educ bern stage reform respons design conceptu level

TEXT:  Appia’s stage design enabled them to ascend and descend in swaying movements to carry the rhythmic interplay of body and architecture into a three-dimensional space.

TEXT:  However, around 1900 the slow demise of the pedagogic observational-style within the discipline is recognizable, as seen in the appearance of a new fashionable term within art history – rhythm.

TEXT:  The sweeping rhythm-obsession of turn-of-the-century German art and art history was not destined to endure. The philosopher Richard Hönigswald (1875–1947), for instance, expressed his concern about the ‘transfer ability of rhythm’ as early as 1926 and mused upon what is now admitted to be a fragile relationship between rhythm and its founding elements (Hönigswald, 1926, p., NR: 1544, Book ID: Architecture and the Body by Kim Sexton, Processed Text: sweep rhythm obsess turn centuri german art art histori wa endur philosoph instanc express concern transfer abil rhythm earli muse upon admit fragil relationship rhythm found element
TEXT:  11). Regarded as an aesthetic principle of almost unrestricted applicability in the early twentieth century, the concept soon began to lose its entire relevance and significance. At least part of the decline of rhythm in German art history is attributable to its association with the racial sciences propagated throughout both world wars (Golston, 2008)., NR: 1545, Book ID: Architecture and the Body by Kim Sexton, Processed Text: aesthet principl almost unrestrict applic earli twentieth centuri concept soon lose entir relev signific least part declin rhythm german art histori attribut associ racial scienc throughout world war
TEXT:  For architectural history, the first instance of this development was in Kurt Gerstenberg’s (1886–1968) dissertation Deutsche Sondergotik (1913), in which the author gives rhythm a nationalistic connotation by comparing French Gothic cathedrals with Late Gothic churches in Germany., NR: 1546, Book ID: Architecture and the Body by Kim Sexton, Processed Text: architectur histori first instanc develop wa dissert author give rhythm nationalist connot cathedr late church

TEXT:  National Socialists such as art historian Alfred Stange (1894–1968) took this tendency further by stipulating that a ‘rhythmic, strongly energized movement’ was a natural principle of German architecture throughout history and it could endure ‘because it runs in the nation’s blood’ (Stange, 1935, p., NR: 1548, Book ID: Architecture and the Body by Kim Sexton, Processed Text: nation socialist art historian took tendenc rhythmic strongli movement wa natur principl german architectur throughout histori could endur run nation blood
TEXT:  234). A renaissance of the rhythmic concept in art history during the postwar period was hardly feasible under these circumstances. In fact, academics such as the Viennese philosopher Friedrich Kainz (1897–1977) argued against the re-use of the principle in the fields of visual arts and architecture and for returning it to its proper and conventional realms in music and poetry (Kainz, 1948, pp., NR: 1549, Book ID: Architecture and the Body by Kim Sexton, Processed Text: renaiss rhythmic concept art histori postwar period wa hardli feasibl circumst fact academ philosoph use principl field visual art architectur proper convent realm music poetri

In designs and texts such as ‘Renewal of the Façade’ (1912), Janák came to inscribe planar spatial cognition through his interpretations of both Riegl’s artistic volition (Kunstwollen) onto space as ‘spatial volition’ (Raumwollen) (Simons, 2007, p., NR: 1600, Book ID: Architecture and the Body by Kim Sexton, Processed Text: instanc engag work art historian sculptor design text renew facad came inscrib planar spatial cognit interpret artist volit onto space spatial volit

TEXT:  Prague between Vienna, Paris and Munich The identity of Czech Cubism has too long and exclusively been discussed in a nationalistic vein, as a turn from Vienna towards Paris in silent revolt against the Austrio-Hungarian Empire in general and against the Viennese Otto Wagner (1848–1918) in particular (Pehnt, 1998, p., NR: 1605, Book ID: Architecture and the Body by Kim Sexton, Processed Text: ident cubism ha long exclus nationalist vein turn toward silent revolt empir gener otto particular
TEXT:  66). The Czech Cubists’ relationships with Paris were complicated, especially by arguments over the qualities of ideal architectural space. After Vlastislav Hofman’s visit to the French capital in 1912, he expressed appreciation for French Cubist painting but challenged architectural designs like Raymond Duchamp-Villon’s (1876–1918) Maison Cubiste (1912) for its lack of spatial inventiveness, calling it an un-oriented ‘sculpture with a painterly flair … [which] fails in its first and last objective, which is to create a new conceptual space, an understanding of space that is new in principle’ (Hofman, 2005c, p., NR: 1606, Book ID: Architecture and the Body by Kim Sexton, Processed Text: cubist relationship complic especi argument qualiti ideal architectur space visit capit express appreci cubist paint architectur design like lack spatial invent call sculptur painterli flair first last object creat new conceptu space understand space new principl
TEXT:  383). While Czech Cubists sought to emancipate and differentiate themselves from Viennese and Parisian artists and architects, they unexpectedly found points of reference in contemporary schools of art history, such as the Vienna School., NR: 1607, Book ID: Architecture and the Body by Kim Sexton, Processed Text: cubist sought emancip differenti artist architect unexpectedli found point refer contemporari school art histori school
TEXT:  Alois Riegl’s influential concept of Kunstwollen, or the role of artistic will (Wollen) instead of ability (Können) focused on the unconditional or creative qualities of art rather than its contextual or consequential aspects (Wyss, 1996, p., NR: 1608, Book ID: Architecture and the Body by Kim Sexton, Processed Text: influenti concept role artist instead abil uncondit creativ qualiti art rather contextu consequenti aspect wyss
TEXT:  311). It proposed a revolutionary interpretation of the history of spatial perception and representation based on a new appreciation for the frequently disparaged art of late antiquity (Riegl, 2000, pp., NR: 1609, Book ID: Architecture and the Body by Kim Sexton, Processed Text: revolutionari interpret histori spatial percept represent base new appreci frequent art late antiqu
TEXT:  18–19). Indeed, Oliver Simons has suggested that one may read artistic volition (Kunstwollen) much more as ‘spatial volition’ (Raumwollen), that is, the prevalence of a respective ‘strategy of spatialization’ (2007, p., NR: 1610, Book ID: Architecture and the Body by Kim Sexton, Processed Text: inde ha one may read artist volit much spatial volit preval respect strategi spatial
TEXT:  161). In their quest towards an unbound, contemporary Czech style, the Cubists like Hofman and Janák took Kunstwollen as an imperative to make the body in space transformative in their own work (Janatková, 2000, pp., NR: 1611, Book ID: Architecture and the Body by Kim Sexton, Processed Text: quest toward unbound contemporari style cubist like took imper make bodi space transform work
TEXT:  89–90). Their positioning of art and architecture in opposition to functional purpose united the Cubists above all else.3 Their unwillingness to subordinate Kunstwollen to practical or even ornamental constraints is found most explicitly in their applied arts and furniture design, up to the point where their materiality became virtually irrelevant (Janák, 1991a, p., NR: 1612, Book ID: Architecture and the Body by Kim Sexton, Processed Text: art architectur opposit function purpos unit cubist els unwilling subordin practic even ornament constraint found explicitli appli art furnitur design point materi virtual irrelev
TEXT:  17). As a result, not only did Czech Cubist furniture not derive its form from material or construction, but, as Janák hoped, it would be deliberately ‘constructed against the logic of how a piece of furniture is joined as carpentry’ (Janák, 1991b, pp., NR: 1613, Book ID: Architecture and the Body by Kim Sexton, Processed Text: result cubist furnitur deriv form materi construct hope would deliber logic piec furnitur carpentri
TEXT:  16–17). Janák then dramatically folded the legs of chairs in his Studies for Seating Furniture (1912) in a nonconstructive fashion, while Hofman designed his Chair (1912) using the least amount of material at the most critical joints of the backrest., NR: 1614, Book ID: Architecture and the Body by Kim Sexton, Processed Text: dramat fold leg chair studi seat furnitur nonconstruct fashion design chair least amount materi critic joint

TEXT:  Only techniques of constructive illusion and concealment helped reify the unbound Czech Cubist Kunstwollen (Herbenová, 1991, pp. 262–3; Lahoda, 1991, p. 298), going just as much beyond traditional methods of craftmanship as beyond existing notions of body and space., NR: 1616, Book ID: Architecture and the Body by Kim Sexton, Processed Text: techniqu construct illus conceal reifi unbound cubist go much beyond tradit method beyond notion bodi space
TEXT:  Façade as relief Both the empirical sciences of perception and contemporary art theory played an essential role towards what would become Czech Cubist approaches to architectural space. An influential figure in this area was, ironically, neoclassical sculptor Adolf von Hildebrand from Munich., NR: 1617, Book ID: Architecture and the Body by Kim Sexton, Processed Text: facad relief empir scienc percept contemporari art theori essenti role toward would becom cubist approach architectur space influenti figur area wa iron sculptor

TEXT:  Largely relying on recent research on cognition, he set two concepts of spatial perception in opposition: the visual (Gesichtsvorstellung) and the kinesthetic or bodily (Bewegungsvorstellung). To him, the first relies on the mind in its perspective ability to transform a two-dimensional distant view (Fernblick) into a three-dimensional image, drawing on spatial memory through former optic and touch experience., NR: 1619, Book ID: Architecture and the Body by Kim Sexton, Processed Text: larg recent research cognit set two concept spatial percept opposit visual kinesthet bodili first mind perspect abil transform two dimension distant view three dimension imag draw spatial memori former optic touch experi
TEXT:  The latter, however, implies a near view (Nahblick), where eyes move over an object and ‘seeing becomes scanning’ (Hildebrand, 1994, p. 229) – when a bronze relief, for instance, is palpated through our physical and optical movement at relative proximity, to follow its spatial qualities in depth., NR: 1620, Book ID: Architecture and the Body by Kim Sexton, Processed Text: latter howev near view eye move object see becom scan bronz relief instanc physic optic movement rel proxim follow spatial qualiti depth

TEXT:  168) in his analysis of the succession of the history of styles as a history of respective relations to space, mentioned above. With scientific discoveries in synesthesia and spatial cognition working their way into discourses among artists as well as art historians, Riegl and Hildebrand found themselves oscillating between fields we would today divide categorically into science and the arts, and both appeared influential in, and essential to, emerging Cubist productions of space., NR: 1622, Book ID: Architecture and the Body by Kim Sexton, Processed Text: analysi success histori style histori respect relat space scientif discoveri synesthesia spatial cognit work way discours among artist well art historian found oscil field would today divid categor scienc art influenti essenti cubist product space
TEXT:  Cognitive issues fascinated and stimulated Janák, who dedicated substantial passages of his essay ‘Renewal of the Façade’ to discussions of synesthesia. Contrasting optical and tactile modes of architectural cognition in both words and drawings, he argued how sight was limited in its more passive qualities, narrowed to the one-sided and momentary perception from a given standpoint., NR: 1623, Book ID: Architecture and the Body by Kim Sexton, Processed Text: cognit issu fascin substanti passag essay renew facad discuss synesthesia optic tactil mode architectur cognit word draw sight wa limit passiv qualiti one side momentari percept given standpoint
TEXT:  Up against that, Janák (1991b) argued for a predominance of touch on account of its more active dependency on the ‘movements of eye, hand, walk and body motion as a whole’ (p. 435) – allowing for successive moments of perception, varying perspectives and a more objective investigation for those aspects hidden from the eye., NR: 1624, Book ID: Architecture and the Body by Kim Sexton, Processed Text: predomin touch account activ depend movement eye hand walk bodi motion whole success moment percept perspect object investig aspect hidden eye
TEXT:  When Janák (1991b) described how ‘the perception of things in our mind … does not have properties of only our eye or our sense of touch, but joins both qualities in some kind of interference’ (p. 435), he appears to owe debt to the notion of ‘body vision’ mentioned above., NR: 1625, Book ID: Architecture and the Body by Kim Sexton, Processed Text: percept thing mind doe properti eye sens touch join qualiti kind interfer owe debt notion bodi vision
TEXT:  Physical movement in space, however, remained a subordinate motif to eye movement, as ‘our visual sensation guides us towards kinesthestic perception and we wander in the distant view, so to say’ (Hildebrand, 1969, p., NR: 1626, Book ID: Architecture and the Body by Kim Sexton, Processed Text: physic movement space howev subordin motif eye movement visual sensat guid toward percept wander distant view say
TEXT:  202).4 Janák believed perception could rely solely on the synesthetic confrontation of sight and touch (1991b, p. 435), a still mode of knowing on which any appreciation of seemingly self-contradictory ‘planar space’ depends – consequently adapting these conceptions into his work as an architect immersed in the articulation of Cubist surfaces., NR: 1627, Book ID: Architecture and the Body by Kim Sexton, Processed Text: percept could reli sole synesthet confront sight touch still mode know appreci seemingli self contradictori planar space consequ concept work architect articul cubist surfac
TEXT:  Janák was not content merely to theorize relationships between architecture, science and the body; he also explored them in experimental façade designs like House Fará (1913). Here, he treated architectural space as a prismatic suspension of gravitational logic by dynamically twisting and tilting surfaces with various slants, angles, facets and curves, in order to ‘express dramatization within the surface’ (Janák, 1991b, p., NR: 1628, Book ID: Architecture and the Body by Kim Sexton, Processed Text: wa content mere theoriz relationship architectur scienc bodi also experiment facad design like hous architectur space prismat suspens gravit logic dynam twist tilt surfac variou slant angl facet curv order express dramat within surfac
TEXT:  436), as he would put it. As some historians have proposed (Moravánszky, 1998, p. 349), one may place Janák’s style within the broader psychological frameset bracketed by Abstraction and Empathy, the antagonism featured in Worringer’s influential 1907 dissertation., NR: 1629, Book ID: Architecture and the Body by Kim Sexton, Processed Text: would put historian one may place style within psycholog abstract empathi antagon featur influenti dissert
TEXT:  Worringer opposed these equivalents of artistic practice through their respective relation of man and world across all borders of time and place, of a harmonic, empathetic immersion against abstraction as a ‘dread of space’ (Worringer, 1997, p., NR: 1630, Book ID: Architecture and the Body by Kim Sexton, Processed Text: oppos equival artist practic respect relat man world across border time place harmon immers abstract dread space
TEXT:  15). Whereas the art of empathy (e.g., that of ancient Greece) consequently allowed for naturalist, three-dimensional representation, abstract art (e.g., the Gothic mode of design) would emerge from the non-representative, meaning that ‘the urge to abstraction finds its beauty in the life-denying inorganic, in the crystalline’ (Worringer, 1997, p., NR: 1631, Book ID: Architecture and the Body by Kim Sexton, Processed Text: wherea art empathi ancient consequ naturalist three dimension represent abstract art mode design would emerg non repres mean urg abstract find beauti life inorgan crystallin
TEXT:  4). As a consequence, Worringer saw the abstract artistic value increased as it went beyond mere imitation to seek expression in planar spatial arrangements (Öhlschläger, 2007, p. 109). Janák (1991b) took abstraction even further, arguing that ‘working spatially, that is, three-dimensionally, does not imply creating actual spaces, as we see those as mere effigies of reality … to us creating means leaving more than what was there before’ (p., NR: 1632, Book ID: Architecture and the Body by Kim Sexton, Processed Text: consequ saw abstract artist valu went beyond mere imit seek express planar spatial arrang took abstract even work spatial three dimension doe impli actual space see mere effigi realiti mean leav wa
TEXT:  436). In his following essay ‘Prism and Pyramid’ (1911), an antagonism quite explicitly exhibiting his commitment to Worringer, Janák then rejected the statistical logic of classical temples as symbols of a prismatic but ‘dihedral system’ in their use of the all-too-limiting vertical (columns) and horizontal (architrave) elements (Janák, 1980, p., NR: 1633, Book ID: Architecture and the Body by Kim Sexton, Processed Text: follow essay prism pyramid antagon quit explicitli commit statist logic classic templ symbol prismat dihedr system use limit vertic column horizont architrav element
TEXT:  165). Up against this, he portrayed the Egyptian pyramid as a model of the so-called trihedral system, which, like his own Cubist practice, embraced a spe-cific form of the psychological disposition of abstraction as conceived by Worringer., NR: 1634, Book ID: Architecture and the Body by Kim Sexton, Processed Text: pyramid model trihedr system like cubist practic form psycholog disposit abstract
TEXT:  Janák’s early works, such as his Design for a monumental Interior (1912) and his Interior of the 1st Exhibition of the Group of Visual Artists (1912) show an interest in the third dimension of architectural space, a seemingly contradictory facet to his oeuvre., NR: 1635, Book ID: Architecture and the Body by Kim Sexton, Processed Text: earli work design monument interior interior exhibit group visual artist show interest third dimens architectur space seemingli contradictori facet
TEXT:  For instance, one finds walls and ceilings converging, while pillars dissolve in wide-spanning structures and cell-vaulted sacral spaces. While these features have led some historians (Svácha, 1995, p., NR: 1636, Book ID: Architecture and the Body by Kim Sexton, Processed Text: instanc one find wall ceil converg pillar dissolv wide structur cell vault sacral space featur led historian
TEXT:  124) to suspect that Janák had drastically shifted his focus on account of his split with the Group of Visual Artists in 1912, there is good evidence for the consistency of his work. Some of his early experiments in 1911, the same year in which he published ‘Prism and Pyramid’, already exhibited an interest in the slanting and twisting of façades., NR: 1637, Book ID: Architecture and the Body by Kim Sexton, Processed Text: suspect drastic focu account split group visual artist good evid consist work earli experi year prism pyramid alreadi interest slant twist facad
TEXT:  And only few months later, one can read Janák in his notebook reasoning how ‘the new system is more of a relief system’ (1990, p. J34). Later writing on spatial qualities of cathedral façades, he would literally deny their implications for interior, three-dimensional space, showing only interest for their vertical articulation of planar space – regarding the longitudinal interior layout of a cathedral’s nave, he only most reluctantly admitted how ‘perhaps this means something indicating the movement of walking through it’ (1990, p., NR: 1638, Book ID: Architecture and the Body by Kim Sexton, Processed Text: month later one read notebook reason new system relief system later write spatial qualiti cathedr facad would liter deni implic interior three dimension space show interest vertic articul planar space regard longitudin interior layout cathedr nave reluctantli admit perhap mean someth movement walk
TEXT:  J60). As a consequence, his earlier experiments may be conceived as attempts to penetrate the enclosing interior façades in planar space, while deeper interest in actual three-dimensional space would be left to Hofman., NR: 1639, Book ID: Architecture and the Body by Kim Sexton, Processed Text: consequ experi may attempt penetr interior facad planar space interest actual three dimension space would left
TEXT:  The case of Janák is commonly used as an example to illustrate how Czech Cubists were either lacking interest for interior space (Lamarová, 1991a, p. 53; Pehnt, 1998, p.68) or constrained by matters of time limitations, habitability and feasibility (Moravánszky, 2006, p., NR: 1640, Book ID: Architecture and the Body by Kim Sexton, Processed Text: case commonli use exampl illustr cubist either interest interior space constrain matter time limit habit feasibl
TEXT:  33). It appears however, that he most consciously problematized the façade as an architectural space by engaging with writings on perception. His argument for a ‘Renewal of the Façade’ was profoundly grounded in contemporary theoretical perspectives, which engaged with space and style as an art historical (Riegl) and psychological (Worringer) category., NR: 1641, Book ID: Architecture and the Body by Kim Sexton, Processed Text: howev conscious facad architectur space engag write percept argument renew facad wa profoundli ground contemporari theoret perspect engag space style art histor psycholog categori

TEXT:  Empathy and interior space In the early twentieth-century quest to develop a genuinely modern architectural expression, the Cubist practice of Vlastislav Hofman stands out, as it represents a more spatial alternative to Janák’s focus on the façade, however spatially realized it might have been., NR: 1644, Book ID: Architecture and the Body by Kim Sexton, Processed Text: empathi interior space earli twentieth centuri quest develop genuin modern architectur express cubist practic stand spatial altern focu facad howev spatial might
TEXT:  Hofman’s work was informed by evolving Central European discourses on topoi of ‘Empathy, Form, and Space’ (Mallgrave and Ikonomoú, 1994, pp. 57–66) within aesthetics, which in the late nineteenth century intersected frequently with psychology, physiology and the history of art., NR: 1645, Book ID: Architecture and the Body by Kim Sexton, Processed Text: work wa inform central discours empathi form space within aesthet late nineteenth centuri frequent psycholog physiolog histori art

TEXT:  In search of an origin for the rising status of the body in late nineteenth-century aesthetics, one may begin with the first physiological definition of empathy, presented by Robert Vischer. Despite its title’s stress on visuality, his 1872 dissertation On the Optical Sense of Form, presented empathy as a spatio-physical phenomenon in which a human being ‘unconsciously projects his own bodily form – and with this also his soul – into the form of an object’ (Vischer, 1994, p., NR: 1648, Book ID: Architecture and the Body by Kim Sexton, Processed Text: search origin rise statu bodi late nineteenth centuri aesthet one may begin first physiolog definit empathi despit titl stress visual dissert optic sens form empathi physic phenomenon human unconsci project bodili form also soul form object
TEXT:  92). Crucial to his understanding was a physical relation of subject and object, one in which the contemplator retraces a sculptural formation in its shape for instance, not in its style, color or material., NR: 1649, Book ID: Architecture and the Body by Kim Sexton, Processed Text: crucial understand wa physic relat subject object one contempl sculptur format shape instanc style color materi
TEXT:  By applying contemporary research on perceptual psychology and physiology, Vischer extended this idea in The Aesthetic Act and the Absolute Form (1874) with the notion of the ‘symbolics of form’ (Formsymbolik), understanding perception as an empathetic act of charging an object with meaning., NR: 1650, Book ID: Architecture and the Body by Kim Sexton, Processed Text: contemporari research perceptu psycholog physiolog extend idea aesthet act absolut form notion symbol form understand percept act charg object mean
TEXT:  Other than formalistic aesthetics, which were interested in absolute rules and forms of beauty, or romanticist aesthetics, which considered objects as enlivened per se, Vischer was much more concerned about the role of the subject., NR: 1651, Book ID: Architecture and the Body by Kim Sexton, Processed Text: formalist aesthet interest absolut rule form beauti romanticist aesthet consid object per wa much concern role subject
TEXT:  By doing so, he also lay stress on the aesthetic process as such, following how ‘the content of an artwork is precisely the artist’ (Vischer, 1927, p. 54) – a paradigm shift at the height of eclecticism, also in its blending of questions of the perception and the creation of art., NR: 1652, Book ID: Architecture and the Body by Kim Sexton, Processed Text: also lay stress aesthet process follow content precis artist paradigm shift height eclectic also blend question percept creation art
TEXT:  And most importantly to the question of science and the body, Vischer extended this argument to the cognition of architectural space, arguing ‘how one may sense the whole world of phenomena, each and everything as a projection of the human condition’ (1927, p., NR: 1653, Book ID: Architecture and the Body by Kim Sexton, Processed Text: importantli question scienc bodi extend argument cognit architectur space one may sens whole world phenomenon everyth project human condit
TEXT:  54) – through retracing a building in its extensions, it may become an immaterial extension of our body and thus charged with empathy.

TEXT:  Announcing not less than an Aesthetics of Space (1897), his work represented an important step on the way to the architectural reception of empathy theory: Lipps referred to the importance of boundaries to the notion of space, as they would charge it with the notion of direction and movement (Lipps, 1966, p., NR: 1655, Book ID: Architecture and the Body by Kim Sexton, Processed Text: less aesthet space work import step way architectur recept empathi theori import boundari notion space would charg notion direct movement

TEXT:  As Mallgrave and Ikonomoú (1994, pp. 42–3) have outlined, art historian Heinrich Wölfflin (1864–1945) had a key role in promoting the evolution of this anthropomorphic perspective on architectural space., NR: 1658, Book ID: Architecture and the Body by Kim Sexton, Processed Text: outlin art historian key role evolut anthropomorph perspect architectur space

TEXT:  167–8). This set the ground for another art historian, August Schmarsow, who presented his inaugural lecture ‘The Essence of Architectural Creation’ (1894) at the University of Leipzig with explicit references to Wölfflin., NR: 1660, Book ID: Architecture and the Body by Kim Sexton, Processed Text: set ground anoth art historian august inaugur lectur essenc architectur creation univers explicit refer
TEXT:  In doing so, he described empathy as the ‘projection of [one’s] three-dimensional spatial intuition’ (Schmarsow, 1994, p. 291) on to a spatial environment. To him, this association of the body and the built is also why we choose terms used to describe spatial qualities such as dimension, extent or direction, which derive from our physical relation to space (Schmarsow, 1994, p., NR: 1661, Book ID: Architecture and the Body by Kim Sexton, Processed Text: empathi project one three dimension spatial intuit spatial environ associ bodi built also choos term use describ spatial qualiti dimens extent direct deriv physic relat space
TEXT:  291). Laying stress on anthropological notions of one’s physiology and proportion, Schmarsow called this kind of three-dimensional perception a ‘sense of space [Raumgefühl]’ (p. 287), acting as the main driving force to both the cognition and imagination (Raumphantasie) as well as creation of space (Raumgestaltung)., NR: 1662, Book ID: Architecture and the Body by Kim Sexton, Processed Text: lay stress anthropolog notion one physiolog proport kind three dimension percept sens space act main drive forc cognit imagin well creation space
TEXT:  In a later article, he broke this down into three distinct qualities of spatial perception, namely, enclosure by walls, verticality in its function to distinguish the body from its vis-à-vis, and, most importantly, movement through space – as a result, the human being in its upright physical condition, walking through interior space and constantly changing perspectives, came to the focus of the discourse on architectural cognition., NR: 1663, Book ID: Architecture and the Body by Kim Sexton, Processed Text: later articl broke three distinct qualiti spatial percept name enclosur wall vertic function distinguish bodi importantli movement space result human upright physic condit walk interior space constantli perspect came focu discours architectur cognit
TEXT:  In Austro-Hungarian Prague, architects closely followed such contemporary discourses on empathy and spatial perception – manifest when Josef Chochol, for instance, translated excerpts of Theodor Lipps’ Aesthetics of Space for a 1913 issue of Style (Janatková, 2000, p., NR: 1664, Book ID: Architecture and the Body by Kim Sexton, Processed Text: architect close contemporari discours empathi spatial percept manifest instanc excerpt aesthet space issu style
TEXT:  105). While some historians have early on speculated on the influence of empathy on the movement (Murray, 1990, p. 4), and others follow Schmarsow’s first anthropological grounding to architectural space (Zug, 2006, pp., NR: 1665, Book ID: Architecture and the Body by Kim Sexton, Processed Text: historian earli influenc empathi movement follow first anthropolog ground architectur space
TEXT:  21–5), more thorough and recent approaches have largely remained with the analysis of Cubist façades (Janatková, 2000, pp. 102–3). This lacking attention to the significance of empathy theory to Cubist approaches towards body and space has led to a failure to embrace Cubism in all its complexities in general, as well as to recognize the distinct and contrary approach of Vlastislav Hofman in particular, both in his theory and design work., NR: 1666, Book ID: Architecture and the Body by Kim Sexton, Processed Text: thorough recent approach larg analysi cubist facad attent signific empathi theori cubist approach toward bodi space ha led failur embrac cubism complex gener well recogn distinct contrari approach particular theori design work
TEXT:  Hofman mirrored Schmarsow in his critique of the Secession, when he criticized the movement’s lack of interest in interior of space (Hofman, 2005b, p. 378), which obviously also took aim at Janák’s occupation with façade ornament., NR: 1667, Book ID: Architecture and the Body by Kim Sexton, Processed Text: mirror critiqu secess movement lack interest interior space obvious also took aim occup facad ornament
TEXT:  Interestingly, one can observe how rivalries and controversies commonly seen separating Riegl and his focus on relief sculpture from Wölfflin and Schmarsow’s exploration of three-dimensional space (Mallgrave and Ikonomoú, 1994, p., NR: 1668, Book ID: Architecture and the Body by Kim Sexton, Processed Text: interestingli one observ rivalri controversi commonli seen separ focu relief sculptur explor three dimension space
TEXT:  58–60) found their equivalent in antagonism within Cubist architectural criticism. In his 1912 interiors for sculptor Josef Mařatka, for instance, Hofman demonstrated how he wanted put these ideas into practice, playing with motifs of weight, construction and detail through slanting lines, tapered forms and facet moldings (Figure 10., NR: 1669, Book ID: Architecture and the Body by Kim Sexton, Processed Text: found equival antagon within cubist architectur critic interior sculptor instanc put idea practic motif weight construct detail slant line taper form facet mold figur

Acting as a counterbalance to a bourgeois inventory, we see him sculpturally reshaping the interior through a massive wooden formation, which bears witness to a designer with high regard for the physical relation of the human body with everyday objects in all of their materiality and gravity., NR: 1670, Book ID: Architecture and the Body by Kim Sexton, Processed Text: act counterbal bourgeoi inventori see sculptur interior massiv wooden format bear wit design high regard physic relat human bodi everyday object materi graviti
TEXT:  In his following article ‘The New Principle in Architecture’, Hofman further drew on notions of spatial aesthetics developed by Schmarsow to explore physiological implications of the cognition of three-dimensional space., NR: 1671, Book ID: Architecture and the Body by Kim Sexton, Processed Text: follow articl new principl architectur drew notion spatial aesthet explor physiolog implic cognit three dimension space
TEXT:  Defining space as this new principle, he elaborated on how architectural creation was conditioned from the nature of spatial cognition (2005b, p. 378). If the human body perceived space in all three dimensions instead of planar, optical impressions, then Cubist architecture, to him, had no choice but to move beyond facades., NR: 1672, Book ID: Architecture and the Body by Kim Sexton, Processed Text: space new principl architectur creation wa condit natur spatial cognit human bodi space three dimens instead planar optic impress cubist architectur choic move beyond facad
TEXT:  In an attempt to substantiate these ideas, one will find Hofman equally inspired by physiological definitions of empathy by Lipps and Vischer, outlined above. Retracing empathy theory in its equation of spatial perception and creation, Hofman openly refused mere psychic logics of cognition: ‘The human spirit cannot be divorced from nature., NR: 1673, Book ID: Architecture and the Body by Kim Sexton, Processed Text: attempt substanti idea one find equal inspir physiolog definit empathi outlin empathi theori equat spatial percept creation openli mere psychic logic cognit human spirit cannot natur
TEXT:  It is through our very nature that we immerse ourselves in apprehending and seeing the world’ (2005b, p. 377). As he later wrote on ‘The Prosaic Beauty of Modern Art’, Hofman would further such ideas on synesthesia in discussing their relevancy to contemporary tendencies in modern painting – and largely appreciate their attempts to draw on visual and sensual sensation at once in towards ‘perceiving the composite quality of space’ (2005d, p., NR: 1674, Book ID: Architecture and the Body by Kim Sexton, Processed Text: natur immers see world later wrote prosaic beauti modern art would idea synesthesia relev contemporari tendenc modern paint larg appreci attempt draw visual sensual sensat toward perceiv composit qualiti space
TEXT:  59). In extending his argument for synesthetic cognition towards other disciplines, Hofman underlined his demand for a revolutionary and unbound Cubist practice.

TEXT:  11 Up against Hofman’s reflections on the potential for Cubist interiors in architecture were the actual interiors themselves. Even fully realized Cubist arrangements such as Josef Gočár’s interior design and furniture for actor Otto Boleška in 1913 conformed to needs of fin-de-siècle bourgeois representation in that they remained within the margins of existing genres and constellations., NR: 1676, Book ID: Architecture and the Body by Kim Sexton, Processed Text: reflect potenti cubist interior architectur actual interior even fulli cubist arrang interior design furnitur actor otto need fin bourgeoi represent within margin genr constel
TEXT:  As a result, contemporary illustration appears to incorporate Cubist designs within pre-furnished apartments, leading to somewhat unexpected assemblages of styles, as happened in the juxtaposition of Cubism and Empire Style in Hofman’s interior for sculptor Josef Mařatka mentioned above – they should prove the impression of Cubist paintings and furniture on bourgeois parlors, as Cubist painter Bohumil Kubišta (1884–1918) outlined accordingly (Kubišta, 2005, pp., NR: 1677, Book ID: Architecture and the Body by Kim Sexton, Processed Text: result contemporari illustr incorpor cubist design within furnish apart lead somewhat unexpect assemblag style juxtaposit cubism empir style interior sculptor prove impress cubist paint furnitur bourgeoi parlor cubist painter outlin accordingli
TEXT:  39–40). Art historian Milena Lamarová, however, sees the Cubist interior as ignoring the logics of purpose, evidence of a conscious shift of interest ‘towards a new and subjective physicality of gesture, movement, uplift and fall’ (1991b, p., NR: 1678, Book ID: Architecture and the Body by Kim Sexton, Processed Text: art historian howev see cubist interior logic purpos evid consciou shift interest toward new subject physic gestur movement uplift fall

Recalling how the Cubists rejected matters of practicality, construction and materialism, one could easily conclude how they wanted their interiors to be looked at as aesthetic statements rather than living spaces, as Kunstwollen materialized in space., NR: 1679, Book ID: Architecture and the Body by Kim Sexton, Processed Text: cubist matter practic construct materi one could easili conclud interior aesthet statement rather live space space

TEXT:  Also, one can see how ideas on stimulating three-dimensional cognition in motion brought Hofman to develop an autonomous interest in circular and central-plan buildings – as opposed to Janák, who simultaneously stressed how one may articulate space in façades and longitudinal buildings (Janák, 1991b, p., NR: 1683, Book ID: Architecture and the Body by Kim Sexton, Processed Text: also one see idea three dimension cognit motion brought develop autonom interest circular central plan build oppos simultan one may articul space facad longitudin build

TEXT:  Through this, he developed a thoroughgoing approach to Cubist architecture in both theory and practice, which was committed to both interior design and urbanism. His outspoken advocacy of space as an anthropological category essential to modern architectural practice presents an alternate disposition of Cubist Raumwollen directed towards the corporeal relation of man and space., NR: 1688, Book ID: Architecture and the Body by Kim Sexton, Processed Text: thoroughgo approach cubist architectur theori practic wa interior design urban outspoken advocaci space anthropolog categori essenti modern architectur practic present altern disposit cubist direct toward corpor relat man space
TEXT:  Cathedrals, crakows and ashtrays Unlike modernists to come, Cubists did not outright eschew precedents for their architectural creations; being surrounded by an array of original and captivating buildings from the mid to late Central European Gothic, they might have been interested in the pointy, jabbing, faceted forms of Gothic., NR: 1689, Book ID: Architecture and the Body by Kim Sexton, Processed Text: cathedr unlik modernist come cubist outright eschew preced architectur creation surround array origin captiv build mid late central might interest pointi jab facet form

TEXT:  In this regard, a major source of inspiration was Worringer’s Abstraction and Empathy (1907), mentioned above, which was attracting an increasingly broad turn-of-the-century audience. An early reviewer of his work, art historian Richard Hamann (1879–1961), noted how Worringer would portray Gothic cathedrals as if they were works of Expressionists and Cubists, which is why one may read his work as a manifesto to contemporary art, not as a piece of science (1915 p., NR: 1691, Book ID: Architecture and the Body by Kim Sexton, Processed Text: regard major sourc inspir wa abstract empathi wa increasingli broad turn centuri audienc earli review work art historian note would portray cathedr work expressionist cubist one may read work manifesto contemporari art piec scienc
TEXT:  361). And in fact, Worringer himself facilitated this approbation through artists, as he transfigured discourses on the history of style, empathy and Völkerpsychologie to the much more intelligible polarity of Abstraction and Empathy, concurring psychic dispositions of one ‘history of the feeling about the world’ (Worringer, 1997, p., NR: 1692, Book ID: Architecture and the Body by Kim Sexton, Processed Text: fact approb artist discours histori style empathi much intellig polar abstract empathi concur psychic disposit one histori feel world
TEXT:  13). To him, empathetic artistic practices stressed naturalist, three-dimensional spatial representations, whereas abstraction originated in deep anxieties and a ‘dread of space’ which strove to handle artistically what Hildebrand called ‘the agonizing quality of the Cubic’ (Worringer, 1997, p., NR: 1693, Book ID: Architecture and the Body by Kim Sexton, Processed Text: artist practic naturalist three dimension spatial represent wherea abstract deep anxieti dread space strove handl artist qualiti cubic
TEXT:  15). In that, Worringer argued for a direct relationship between individual perception and creation, so that a person gravitated toward ‘primitivist’ art (e.g., Gothic or Cubism) on account of psychology., NR: 1694, Book ID: Architecture and the Body by Kim Sexton, Processed Text: direct relationship individu percept creation person toward primitivist art cubism account psycholog
TEXT:  He consciously turned empathy from an aesthetic to a cultural concept and construed a dichotomy of northern and southern folk characters divided by an atemporal boundary. It was in redefining Empathy as an Aesthetics of Nature, how he built up the Aesthetics of Abstraction or the Gothic, as a ‘gratification of that inner need for self-activation in which Lipps sees the presupposition of the urge to empathy’ (Worringer, 1997, p., NR: 1695, Book ID: Architecture and the Body by Kim Sexton, Processed Text: conscious turn empathi aesthet cultur concept dichotomi northern southern folk charact divid atempor boundari wa empathi aesthet natur built aesthet abstract gratif inner need self activ see presupposit urg empathi
TEXT:  14). Worringer’s belief in architectural form as resulting from respective stylistic-psychological relations of man to space – pantheism or immanence (empathy) versus transcendency or alienation (abstraction) – set a model for the Cubists’ self-identification with abstract or Gothic spatial creations and concomitant notions revolving around body, scale and genre., NR: 1696, Book ID: Architecture and the Body by Kim Sexton, Processed Text: belief architectur form result respect stylist psycholog relat man space pantheism imman empathi versu transcend alien abstract set model cubist self identif abstract spatial creation concomit notion revolv around bodi scale genr
TEXT:  The Cubists seem to have seen Gothic through the eyes and mind of Worringer rather than simply turning them to inspiring examples of their regional Gothic. They absorbed Worringer’s method of abstracting architecture to underlying psychological principles, and hence privileged his ‘latent Gothic’ (geheime Gotik), that is, hidden Gothic character, over ‘Gothic proper’ (eigentliche Gotik) (Worringer 1920, p., NR: 1697, Book ID: Architecture and the Body by Kim Sexton, Processed Text: cubist seem seen eye mind rather simpli turn inspir exampl region absorb method architectur underli psycholog principl henc privileg latent hidden charact proper
TEXT:  146).5 This difference may not be as clear-cut as it appears, of course, because Cubist forms recall few architectural forms more closely than Bohemian cell vaults, as historians have long recognized (Švácha, 2005, p., NR: 1698, Book ID: Architecture and the Body by Kim Sexton, Processed Text: differ may clear cut cours cubist form recal architectur form close cell vault historian long
TEXT:  38). But certain Cubists in the Czech lands, like Janák, were very interested in the psychological Gothic character of things, which they found in triangular and pyramidal shapes and profile across borders of time and place, even though they were obviously characteristic of much medieval Gothic design as well., NR: 1699, Book ID: Architecture and the Body by Kim Sexton, Processed Text: certain cubist land like interest psycholog charact thing found triangular pyramid shape profil across border time place even though obvious characterist much mediev design well
TEXT:  Mirroring Worringer’s volume in his title Prism and Pyramid, Janák makes it clear that Gothic character is found in monuments which are not remotely Gothic in design, while his prism corresponded to Worringer’s art of empathy, that is, southern European classical art (Janatková, 2000, p., NR: 1700, Book ID: Architecture and the Body by Kim Sexton, Processed Text: volum titl prism pyramid make clear charact found monument remot design prism art empathi southern classic art
TEXT:  108). Hence, Janák (1980) could argue that the Egyptian pyramid was the most vivid example of nordic, abstract art rather than a Gothic cathedral (one presumes) (p. 163). Hofman went even further and contrasted a nordic ‘new Europe’ (2005e, p., NR: 1701, Book ID: Architecture and the Body by Kim Sexton, Processed Text: henc could argu pyramid wa vivid exampl abstract art rather cathedr one went even new
TEXT:  381), represented by the cone or pyramid pointing heavenwards with a classicist, traditionalist south circle or cube in all its ‘most cumbersome monumentality’ (2005e, p. 374). Cubists in Central Europe viewed the Gothic, and even the Baroque to a certain extent, as exemplifying a ‘nordic’ psychological disdain for inertia in bodies and matter and ‘sympathizing’ (Lipps, 1966, p., NR: 1702, Book ID: Architecture and the Body by Kim Sexton, Processed Text: cone pyramid point heavenward classicist traditionalist south circl cube cumbersom monument cubist central even baroqu certain extent psycholog disdain inertia bodi matter sympath
TEXT:  7) by means of architectural cognition with the erect and narrow ‘nordic’ body (Janatková, 2000, p. 116) – reducing an actual built object to a physical expression of a psychological state, Worringer’s Gothic as a ‘petrified vertical movement’ (Worringer, 1920, p., NR: 1703, Book ID: Architecture and the Body by Kim Sexton, Processed Text: mean architectur cognit erect narrow bodi reduc actual built object physic express psycholog state petrifi vertic movement
TEXT:  84), so to say. Indeed, Hofman wrote that a ‘Gothic cathedral towers upwards like a finger pointing to heaven,’ abstracting this position further by adding that ‘this form is so empathic that we could replace the concept of the Gothic Weltanschauung with the concept of the space of a cone’ (Hofman, 2005e, p., NR: 1704, Book ID: Architecture and the Body by Kim Sexton, Processed Text: say inde wrote cathedr tower upward like finger point heaven posit form empath could replac concept concept space cone
TEXT:  374). He took such embodied abstractions of the Gothic – its dematerialization and transcendency – almost literally not only in writing, but by inscribing them into objects, such as the vases he designed in his early and late Cubist phases., NR: 1705, Book ID: Architecture and the Body by Kim Sexton, Processed Text: took abstract transcend almost liter write object va design earli late cubist phase
TEXT:  In both cases, their slender, entangled and tapered composition is a consistent attempt to minimize material and play with opposing volumes and disbalance as an embodiment of the nordic state. The clear shift from conical (1911) to pyramidal (1914) shapes, however, reflects his late appropriation of Janák’s notion that pyramids were the equivalent formal expression of Cubist bodies to assume., NR: 1706, Book ID: Architecture and the Body by Kim Sexton, Processed Text: case slender entangl taper composit consist attempt minim materi play oppos volum disbal embodi state clear shift conic pyramid shape howev late appropri notion pyramid equival formal express cubist bodi assum
TEXT:  To Hofman, Cubist abstraction primarily referred to a general concept of form, one that was an analogue for bodily constitutions and originated in a psychological relation of man and space – and manifested itself only secondarily in a formal expression, which appears to be almost interchangeable., NR: 1707, Book ID: Architecture and the Body by Kim Sexton, Processed Text: cubist abstract primarili gener concept form one wa analogu bodili constitut psycholog relat man space manifest secondarili formal express almost interchang
TEXT:  Even if abstraction did reduce form to a general concept, Hofman’s designs seem to have embodied ‘latent Gothic’ character in real, physical ways. His Ďáblice Cemetery, for instance, reveals his fascination for the skeletal and dematerialized structure of the Bohemian Gothic cathedral, and stands as an example for his attempt to transfer psycho-corporeal metaphors to architecture – realizing his writings on how modern architecture approximated the Gothic, as in it ‘longs to apply its sense of constructional form, as opposed to the superficial form which could be taken from a body without detriment’ (Hofman, 2005b, p., NR: 1708, Book ID: Architecture and the Body by Kim Sexton, Processed Text: even abstract reduc form gener concept design seem latent charact real physic way cemeteri instanc fascin skelet structur cathedr stand exampl attempt transfer corpor metaphor architectur realiz write modern architectur long appli sens construct form oppos superfici form could taken bodi without detriment

The Cubists would have been familiar with Wölfflin’s 1886 Prolegomena, in which he argued how architectural styles emerged as they reflected the ways the mind wanted the body to appear and move., NR: 1709, Book ID: Architecture and the Body by Kim Sexton, Processed Text: cubist would familiar prolegomenon architectur style reflect way mind bodi appear move
TEXT:  His famous analogy of Gothic cathedrals and crakows, that is, pointy medieval shoes, no doubt appealed to Cubists: ‘The human foot points forward but does that show in the blunt outline in which it terminates?

TEXT:  The Gothic age was troubled by this lack of the precise expression of a will, and so it devised a shoe with a long pointed toe’ (Wölfflin, 1994, p. 183). In paralleling imagery of clothing and architecture, Wölfflin identified precision, poignancy and finally dissolution as the psychological notions expressed in Gothic posture, where ‘all mass, all still breadth dwindles away; the body is entirely dissolved in nerves’ (Wölfflin, 1986, pp., NR: 1711, Book ID: Architecture and the Body by Kim Sexton, Processed Text: age wa lack precis express shoe long point toe imageri cloth architectur precis poignanc final dissolut psycholog notion express postur mass still breadth away bodi entir nerv
TEXT:  84–5). A careful reader of Wölfflin, Hofman seems to have aimed at com parable expressions in his unrealized designs for the cemetery, leading conical lines of buttress-like force from the crest to bottom (like a flying buttress) and all vertical elements dissolving in glass and ribs., NR: 1712, Book ID: Architecture and the Body by Kim Sexton, Processed Text: care reader parabl express unreal design cemeteri lead conic line buttress like forc crest bottom like fli buttress vertic element dissolv glass rib
TEXT:  In suspending the physical mass of the building volumes, he approximated an abstract, transcendent and uncorporeal expression. In Czech Cubist circles, Wölfflin’s work intrigued both art historians and architects, and it was again Worringer helping them to translate these psychosomatic inspirations toward their work in many media., NR: 1713, Book ID: Architecture and the Body by Kim Sexton, Processed Text: physic mass build volum abstract transcend express cubist circl work art historian architect wa help translat psychosomat inspir toward work mani medium
TEXT:  Going beyond his own findings in Abstraction and Empathy, Worringer built extensively on his former teacher when he presented his Form Problems of the Gothic (1910).

TEXT:  19), which he described as characterized by transcendency and immateriality across all scales and genres. Continuing analogies of clothing and architecture, he wrote that the ‘contrast of body and drapery, which is so characteristic of middle Gothic art, is nothing but the contrast of actuality [that is, reality, Wirklichkeit] and non-actuality, or super-actuality [that is, surreality, Überwirklichkeit]’ (p., NR: 1715, Book ID: Architecture and the Body by Kim Sexton, Processed Text: transcend immateri across scale genr analog cloth architectur wrote contrast bodi draperi characterist middl art noth contrast actual realiti non actual super actual

TEXT:  Czech Cubists quickly appropriated these widening perspectives, especially those issues that aided in building analogies between corporeal and architectural form. Hofman went so far as to claim that ‘a line leading through a Gothic rib is an abstract internal form that changes dead matter into a living formation’ (2005b, p., NR: 1718, Book ID: Architecture and the Body by Kim Sexton, Processed Text: cubist quickli perspect especi issu build analog corpor architectur form went far claim line lead rib abstract intern form chang dead matter live format

TEXT:  As Janátková has shown (2000, pp. 55–6), also Riegl played a major role in this instance, as he only recently had presented his Cult of Monuments (1903), where he demanded to radically reform preservation, to suspend all boundaries of art and nonart, arguing for an anti-elitist inclusion of all kinds of relics ignored from so-called high culture – manifest in the value of any ‘teared out paper note’ (Riegl, 1995, p 145)., NR: 1720, Book ID: Architecture and the Body by Kim Sexton, Processed Text: ha shown also major role instanc recent cult monument radic reform preserv suspend boundari art anti inclus kind relic high cultur manifest valu paper note
TEXT:  To that effect, Hofman argued how ‘art asserts itself in everyday objects, in the applied arts, and even in the construction of a church; in that respect, it is democratic’ (Hofman, 2005b, p. 377). Yet, not only did he mention small objects in passing, but place them centre-stage, stressing how only the applied arts allowed artists to relate to the scale of the human body and the everyday movements it performed when using objects., NR: 1721, Book ID: Architecture and the Body by Kim Sexton, Processed Text: effect art everyday object appli art even construct church respect democrat yet mention small object pass place stage appli art artist relat scale human bodi everyday movement object
TEXT:  Also, he saw small-scale objects exhibit his aesthetic ideals much more explicitly than other forms of artistic production in that their creation was free from many of the material, constructional or functional constraints present in architecture, for instance (Hofman, 2005b, pp., NR: 1722, Book ID: Architecture and the Body by Kim Sexton, Processed Text: also saw small scale object exhibit aesthet ideal much explicitli form artist product creation wa free mani materi construct function constraint present architectur instanc
TEXT:  377–8). Not surprisingly, Hofman’s realized Ashtray (1912) stood indeed much closer to his initial sketches as in the case of his entrance gateway to Ďáblice Cemetery – which was realized without key features such as the central mortuary, the Gothicized buttress, and the wing sculptures., NR: 1723, Book ID: Architecture and the Body by Kim Sexton, Processed Text: surprisingli stood inde much closer initi sketch case entranc gateway cemeteri wa without key featur central mortuari buttress wing sculptur

TEXT:  Simultaneously, the practices and images engendered by the telethon also contributed to the production of a post-war national identity of a charitable and tolerant public. Under the rhetoric of inclusion, Het Dorp expelled this cloistered disabled figure into the Village enclave, achieving a double purification: constituting the virtuous Dutch citizen through participation in the collective nationalist project, and cleansing the body politic of its invaliden – invalid bodies., NR: 1777, Book ID: Architecture and the Body by Kim Sexton, Processed Text: simultan practic imag telethon also product post war nation ident charit toler public rhetor inclus het dorp cloister disabl figur villag enclav doubl purif virtuou dutch citizen particip collect nationalist project cleans bodi polit invalid bodi

In Chapter 3 of this volume, Catherine Barrett explored how blended bodies in sculpted form (e.g., hybrid and mixed-species figures) were, in contrast, a very public presence in medieval Cordes, where they articulated, sometimes ambiguously, social preoccupations ranging from sensual appetites to concerns about spirituality and morality., NR: 1808, Book ID: Architecture and the Body by Kim Sexton, Processed Text: chapter volum blend bodi form hybrid mix speci figur contrast public presenc mediev articul sometim ambigu social preoccup rang sensual appetit concern spiritu moral
TEXT:  Hence, at a time when occult practices were beginning to make room for natural sciences, marginal bodies were gaining visibility as architectural mediators and orchestrators of urban space.

TEXT:  While images of house, street and village evoke town building, other design features reveal their aspirations to medicalize the disabled body. For example, strategically located curved corners in Het Dorp’s ‘street’ were an idea based on concepts of ‘natural movement patterns of the human occupants as they walked or rolled down the hallways’, something that Joy Knoblauch notes was in the air for new health care institution design infused by social science methods (Knoblauch, 2012, p., NR: 1844, Book ID: Architecture and the Body by Kim Sexton, Processed Text: imag hous street villag evok town build design featur reveal aspir disabl bodi exampl strateg curv corner het dorp street idea base concept natur movement pattern human occup roll hallway someth joy note wa air new health care institut design social scienc method

TEXT:  Nazi ideology, based on a global eugenic science, held that the ‘unfit’ bodies of the disabled represented a biological threat to public health, and thus needed to be eradicated.

TEXT:  Yet, their design basis was elder housing, which thereby likened the disabled body to a post-vital organism. Designers also had to consider how to accommodate the residents’ caregivers.

TEXT:  174). Het Dorp’s vision of a wheelchair accessible community of mobile bodies that easily and routinely ventured beyond the confines of a single building owed an enormous debt to applied sciences; as Zola acknowledged, it was ‘a tribute to modern technology and what could be done to make life livable’ for people with disabilities (Zola, 1982, p., NR: 1895, Book ID: Architecture and the Body by Kim Sexton, Processed Text: het dorp vision access commun mobil bodi easili routin beyond singl build enorm debt appli scienc acknowledg wa tribut modern technolog could done make life livabl peopl disabl

TEXT:  Residents have to use the exterior roads to move about the complex, which many find demands too much physical effort.

TEXT:  172). Thus, while the village is accessible in the commonly understood sense, residency there actually shortens the period of autonomous ambulation for bodies with progressive disabilities. Despite the participation of residents in the creative process, Bakema’s scientific approach to developing normalizing architecture for impaired bodies was itself limited by powerful stereotypes about people with disabilities., NR: 1900, Book ID: Architecture and the Body by Kim Sexton, Processed Text: thu villag access commonli understood sens resid actual period autonom ambul bodi progress disabl despit particip resid creativ process scientif approach architectur bodi wa limit power stereotyp peopl disabl

TEXT:  The drawing convention excluded the varied and often collective movements, of resident and caregiver, used to maneuver a wheelchair user’s body between the chair and architectural fixtures.

TEXT:  Bakema’s decision to model the design on elder housing (noted above) revealed the influence of another stereotype of the disabled, which both contradicted the project’s avowed progressivism and ignored one of his basic planning principles: the mixing of different residence types as advocated in his 1964 architectural manifesto From Doorstep to City (Van Dijk, 1999, p., NR: 1905, Book ID: Architecture and the Body by Kim Sexton, Processed Text: decis model design elder hous note reveal influenc anoth stereotyp disabl project avow progressiv one basic principl differ resid type architectur manifesto doorstep citi van

TEXT:  64). By contrast, Het Dorp’s plan consisted of unvarying ‘small-scale, repetitive, cellular forms’ that did not reflect a village population that was varied (Buch, 1998, p. 298). Instead, the presumption of dependency of the inhabitants eclipsed the importance of the family unit in Bakema’s tenet of giving each individual the ability to live as complete a life as possible (Wagenaar, 2000, p., NR: 1907, Book ID: Architecture and the Body by Kim Sexton, Processed Text: contrast het dorp plan unvari small scale repetit cellular form reflect villag popul wa vari instead presumpt depend inhabit import famili unit tenet give individu abil live complet life possibl
TEXT:  269). The presupposed lack of social and emotional capacity was expressed in a determinist relationship between the disabled residents’ units and the unit for the caregiver who lived on each street. Significantly, neither sponsors nor designers considered that residents might fall in love and marry, so initial plans did not accommodate cohabitation., NR: 1908, Book ID: Architecture and the Body by Kim Sexton, Processed Text: lack social emot capac wa express determinist relationship disabl resid unit unit live street significantli neither sponsor design consid resid might fall love marri initi plan accommod cohabit

TEXT:  Irving Zola, who visited Het Dorp as a disabled participant-observer in the early 1970s, commented that ‘the absence of forethought on the possibility of love and marriage for the handicapped was a sign of a more basic omission in the denial of [their] sexuality altogether’ (Zola, 1982, p., NR: 1910, Book ID: Architecture and the Body by Kim Sexton, Processed Text: het dorp disabl particip observ earli absenc forethought possibl love marriag handicap wa sign basic omiss denial sexual altogeth

TEXT:  This utopian approach to architecture, developed in 1963, aimed to reinstantiate the body in built form through the use of destabilizing inclined planes, or ‘obliques’. The overall impression of the church is that of a Brutalist design consistent with trends toward aesthetic austerity in terms of decoration and formal experimentation that characterized postwar sacred architecture, although on the surface, its ponderous heft and total lack of ornamentation has little to do with the sanctified body to whom the building was consecrated., NR: 1966, Book ID: Architecture and the Body by Kim Sexton, Processed Text: utopian approach architectur bodi built form use plane obliqu overal impress church brutalist design consist trend toward aesthet auster term decor formal experiment postwar sacr architectur although surfac ponder heft total lack ornament ha littl sanctifi bodi build wa consecr
TEXT: 2 The church of Ste-Bernadette sits like a concrete fortress in the midst of the suburban Rue du Banlay, and indeed the design for the church was in large part inspired by ruined German military bunkers on the Atlantic Wall, a string of fortifications built by Nazi forces from France to the upper reaches of Norway, which Virilio studied and photographed from 1958 to 1965., NR: 1967, Book ID: Architecture and the Body by Kim Sexton, Processed Text: church like concret fortress midst suburban rue inde design church wa larg part inspir ruin german militari bunker atlant wall string fortif built forc upper reach studi
TEXT:  In terms of science and technology, thickly built shelters like bunkers, pill boxes and observation towers which protected warriors and their weapons seem like a throwback to the Middle Ages.

TEXT:  Reinforced concrete bunkers extended far behind the front lines to protect bodies, machines and goods stored at important industries and warehouses (Brice, 1985, pp. 168–74).

TEXT:  The commission for the church of Ste-Bernadette was part of a larger initiative which resulted in the construction of approximately 2,500 churches in France between 1945 and 1970, which was both to counter the loss of religious buildings wrought by World War II, and to combat the recent perceived secularization of France (Migayrou, 2010, p., NR: 1975, Book ID: Architecture and the Body by Kim Sexton, Processed Text: commiss church wa part initi construct approxim church wa counter loss religi build wrought world war combat recent secular

TEXT: 3 Aesthetically and psychologically, the design instantiated the architects’ principle of the fonction oblique. The locus of Ste-Bernadette was conceived in two inverse inclined planes formed by large cantilevers, an architectural schema that is expressed on the exterior of the church as two large, interconnected concrete shells, with each side jutting out from the middle of the structure at an incline that mirrors that of the cantilevers beneath., NR: 1977, Book ID: Architecture and the Body by Kim Sexton, Processed Text: aesthet psycholog design architect principl obliqu locu wa two invers plane form larg cantilev architectur schema express exterior church two larg concret shell side jut middl structur inclin mirror cantilev beneath

TEXT:  With reinforced concrete walls entirely bereft of relief carving, the exterior of Ste-Bernadette does look more like a military bunker than a church.

TEXT:  But the church also provoked controversy among other European architects: when Parent and Virilio traveled to England in June of 1966 for the Folkestone IDEA (International Dialogue of Experimental Architecture), an important symposium on experimental architecture attended by Yona Friedman, Cedric Price and Hans Hollein, among others, French students in the audience welcomed the designers of Ste-Bernadette with a Nazi salute, suggesting that the building was perceived not only as aggressive but as Fascist., NR: 1980, Book ID: Architecture and the Body by Kim Sexton, Processed Text: church also controversi among architect parent travel june idea intern dialogu experiment architectur import symposium experiment architectur price han among student audienc design salut suggest build wa aggress fascist

TEXT: 5 The body of Saint Bernadette If the exterior of Parent and Virilio’s ‘bunker’ church was a mechanized and metaphorical epidermis, its interior was an anatomical and sanctified body. The body was inscribed into the very structure of church: Parent and Virilio modeled the ground floor plan for Ste-Bernadette after the image of the human heart, with the two interlocking halves of the building mimicking two ventricles., NR: 1983, Book ID: Architecture and the Body by Kim Sexton, Processed Text: bodi saint exterior parent bunker church wa metaphor epidermi interior wa anatom sanctifi bodi bodi wa structur church parent ground floor plan imag human heart two half build two ventricl
TEXT:  Virilio frequently made epidermal analogies with the bunkers, calling them ‘carcasses of extinct species’. Given that the duty of the epidermis is to house and protect what’s inside the body, it seems appropriate that the interior of Ste-Bernadette would adopt the form of the most essential organ., NR: 1984, Book ID: Architecture and the Body by Kim Sexton, Processed Text: frequent made epiderm analog bunker call carcass extinct speci given duti epidermi hous protect insid bodi appropri interior would adopt form essenti organ
TEXT:  The inscription of the body into architecture was nothing new: bodily proportion was an important component of Classical Greek temple architecture, but one that was preceded, as Lian Chang has shown in Chapter 1, by the ‘articulated body’ as a metaphor for the craft of building in the Archaic period., NR: 1985, Book ID: Architecture and the Body by Kim Sexton, Processed Text: inscript bodi architectur wa noth new bodili proport wa import compon classic templ architectur one wa chang ha shown chapter articul bodi metaphor craft build archaic period
TEXT:  More recent to Ste-Bernadette was the Modulor, an anthropomorphic scale of measure developed by the Swiss architect Le Corbusier (1887–1965), based on the height of a man with his arms raised overhead, which made obvious allusion to Leonardo da Vinci’s famous Vitruvian Man., NR: 1986, Book ID: Architecture and the Body by Kim Sexton, Processed Text: recent wa anthropomorph scale measur swiss architect base height man arm rais overhead made obviou allus famou man
TEXT:  However, the plan for Ste-Bernadette is distinct from all of these examples, in that it evokes an internal organ: it is not just a fragmented body (as in the anatomically derived measurement of a foot), but a dismembered body., NR: 1987, Book ID: Architecture and the Body by Kim Sexton, Processed Text: howev plan distinct exampl intern organ fragment bodi anatom deriv measur foot dismemb bodi

TEXT:  Anatomization of the body in order to determine sanctity was a medieval and early modern practice, one which had implications for Renaissance architecture, as Chloe Costello has shown in chapter 6.

TEXT:  The inviolability of the body of Bernadette Soubirous was therefore an important part of her canonization, as her remains were exhumed no less than three times (in 1909, 1919 and again in 1925) to verify their uncorrupted state., NR: 1991, Book ID: Architecture and the Body by Kim Sexton, Processed Text: inviol bodi wa therefor import part canon remain less three time verifi uncorrupt state

TEXT:  In a report Comte subsequently published in 1928, he both marveled at the pristine state of Bernadette’s body, and expressed his desire to have the heart extracted, which he ‘felt sure existed in a perfect state’., NR: 1993, Book ID: Architecture and the Body by Kim Sexton, Processed Text: report subsequ pristin state bodi express desir heart extract felt sure perfect state
TEXT:  He ultimately left the heart intact based on both the Mother Superior’s wishes to keep heart and body together, and the physical difficulty of extraction (Ravier, 2007). The Mother Superior need not have worried, because the removal of the heart symbolically occurs in the architecture of the church of Ste-Bernadette: as a site without a physical relic of the saint, the ground plan transforms the building itself into relic., NR: 1994, Book ID: Architecture and the Body by Kim Sexton, Processed Text: ultim left heart intact base mother superior wish keep heart bodi togeth physic difficulti extract mother superior need worri remov heart symbol architectur church site without physic relic saint ground plan build relic
TEXT:  That heart-as-relic is protected by an architectural skin – again, the epidermal remains of an extinct species. Indeed, the church of Ste-Bernadette nodded to a religious practice had practically gone extinct: the anatomization of the body into relics to be venerated, along with the belief in the unassailable body of a saint owing to his or her holiness., NR: 1995, Book ID: Architecture and the Body by Kim Sexton, Processed Text: heart relic architectur skin epiderm remain extinct speci inde church religi practic practic gone extinct anatom bodi relic along belief unassail bodi saint owe holi
TEXT:  But the act of ensconcing the heart in a shell meant to evoke a military bunker – a structure for protection against violent onslaught – simultaneously acknowledged a present and likely a future in which a body as miraculously incorruptible as Bernadette’s was no longer meaningful within a horizon of possibility., NR: 1996, Book ID: Architecture and the Body by Kim Sexton, Processed Text: act heart shell meant evok militari bunker structur protect violent onslaught simultan acknowledg present like futur bodi miracul incorrupt wa longer meaning within horizon possibl
TEXT:  The unassailability of the body could only be achieved (if at all) through physical fortification against attack. Cryptic architecture: against the visible If we read the church of Ste-Bernadette as symbolically containing (and literally embodying) the heart of the saint, then the church is not merely a place of worship, but a reliquary, or as Virilio and Parent argued, a modern adaptation of the crypt., NR: 1997, Book ID: Architecture and the Body by Kim Sexton, Processed Text: bodi could physic fortif attack cryptic architectur visibl read church symbol liter heart saint church mere place worship reliquari parent modern adapt crypt
TEXT:  As an ancient form of religious and funereal architecture, the crypt encapsulated both the church’s function as a sacred space for religious rites and its traditional role as a container for interred bodies awaiting Judgment Day., NR: 1998, Book ID: Architecture and the Body by Kim Sexton, Processed Text: ancient form religi funer architectur crypt church function sacr space religi rite tradit role contain bodi judgment day
TEXT:  Paradoxically, then, in the designers’ mind, the bodies of the dead were assimilated to the form of the church-as-bunker.

TEXT:  In a text on cryptic architecture written in 1965 and published in the seventh issue of Architecture Principe in 1966, Virilio reeled off a global slate of mythic structures, ending with the mundane bunker: ‘Mayan palaces devoid of windows and chimneys, the impenetrable forests of Egyptian columns, catacombs, the oval-shaped underground networks of the Cathars, the Viet-Cong sanctuaries, Faust’s hermetic home, the copper mines of the Swiss mountains or the bunker’ (Virilio, 1966c, p., NR: 2000, Book ID: Architecture and the Body by Kim Sexton, Processed Text: text cryptic architectur written seventh issu architectur reel global slate structur end mundan bunker palac devoid window chimney impenetr forest column catacomb oval shape underground network sanctuari faust hermet home copper mine swiss mountain bunker
TEXT:  XVIII) He noted that while crypts were a dynamic part of Neolithic society’s care of the disanimated body, their importance declined beginning with the Greek classical age and its substituting of the ‘evident thing for the containing thing’ (Virilio, 1966c, p., NR: 2001, Book ID: Architecture and the Body by Kim Sexton, Processed Text: note crypt dynam part neolith societi care bodi import declin begin classic age substitut evid thing thing
TEXT:  XVIII) The privileging of the ‘evident thing’ is another way of describing the primacy of sight, which began with Greek philosophy and culture. Vision was tied to morality and knowledge; for instance, the Greek word for truth, eidenei, referred to the ‘state of having seen’., NR: 2002, Book ID: Architecture and the Body by Kim Sexton, Processed Text: evid thing anoth way primaci sight philosophi cultur vision wa tie moral knowledg instanc word truth state seen
TEXT: 6 The conceptual importance of vision led to the artistic significance of visibility, and consequently Greek architecture tended toward the monumental: a Greek burial, for example, was typically marked by a monument, which was essentially all façade with no interior., NR: 2003, Book ID: Architecture and the Body by Kim Sexton, Processed Text: conceptu import vision led artist signific visibl consequ architectur toward monument burial exampl wa typic mark monument wa essenti facad interior
TEXT:  This was a marked shift from the Etruscan necropolis that preceded it, for which plain facades masked elaborate above-ground tombs not unlike a bunker in form. The crypt is everything that the monument is not: hidden, dark and obscured., NR: 2004, Book ID: Architecture and the Body by Kim Sexton, Processed Text: wa mark shift necropoli plain facad mask elabor ground tomb unlik bunker form crypt everyth monument hidden dark
TEXT:  Anti-monumental, the crypt resists visibility. Henri Lefebvre likewise described the veneration of vision as endemic to Western society, an attribute which first had to be exhumed in the late Middle Ages from the dross of the early Christian preoccupation with death and the hereafter, a worldview symbolized spatially by catacombs and crypts under churches., NR: 2005, Book ID: Architecture and the Body by Kim Sexton, Processed Text: anti monument crypt visibl likewis vener vision endem western societi attribut first late middl age dross earli preoccup death hereaft spatial catacomb crypt church
TEXT:  This was a ‘decrypting’ process, in Lefebvre’s terminology, referring to the transition from dark, subterranean burials and ritual spaces to an above-ground proliferation of monuments and facades. But he takes this further to argue that with the decrypting of space, thought and philosophy also rose from the depths, and indeed ‘life was decrypted as a result’ (Lefebvre, 1991, p., NR: 2006, Book ID: Architecture and the Body by Kim Sexton, Processed Text: wa process terminolog transit dark subterranean burial ritual space ground prolifer monument facad take argu space thought philosophi also rose depth inde life wa result
TEXT:  260). Cryptic space, for Lefebvre, is a space of psychic repression and also of the feminine, an argument that he supports with the classic bodily binary between the erect and phallic monument opposed to voids and hidden openings associated with the female body (Lefebvre, 1991, pp., NR: 2007, Book ID: Architecture and the Body by Kim Sexton, Processed Text: cryptic space space psychic repress also feminin argument support classic bodili binari erect phallic monument oppos void hidden open associ femal bodi
TEXT:  260–1). The commentary on cryptic architecture espoused by both Virilio and Lefebvre is germane to the church of Ste-Bernadette. In spite of the masculinity that we might superficially associate with militarism of the bunker reference, the church resists any definitive gender identification with what Lefebvre would describe as yonic antimonumentality, not to mention its relationship to a historical woman., NR: 2008, Book ID: Architecture and the Body by Kim Sexton, Processed Text: commentari cryptic architectur german church spite masculin might superfici associ militar bunker refer church definit gender identif would describ mention relationship histor woman
TEXT:  The building also enacted a return of the repressed that likely fed much of the public outrage upon its completion, as it was all-too-reminiscent of a monument of war, and a German monument at that, touching upon the shame of French collaboration., NR: 2009, Book ID: Architecture and the Body by Kim Sexton, Processed Text: build also return repress like fed much public outrag upon complet wa reminisc monument war german monument touch upon shame collabor
TEXT:  Finally, in terms of the subordination of the visual: the darkness of the crypt, and indeed the limited amount of natural light in Ste-Bernadette, makes touch a more reliable faculty than sight.

TEXT:  Notably, both the interior and exterior of Ste-Bernadette are austere, with few ornamental flourishes, save the small stained-glass windows. Consistent with the push against visibility that is endemic to both bunker and cryptic architecture, the church of Ste-Bernadette engages the visitor in bodily rather than optical terms: inclined planes achieved through the cantilevering activate the body, and the assertive use of concrete gives the building a sculptural quality that is more tactile than visual., NR: 2012, Book ID: Architecture and the Body by Kim Sexton, Processed Text: notabl interior exterior auster ornament flourish save small glass window consist push visibl endem bunker cryptic architectur church visitor bodili rather optic term plane activ bodi assert use concret give build sculptur qualiti tactil visual
TEXT:  The oblique function: a body in motion The sculptural quality of the building is crucial in materializing Parent and Virilio’s theory of the oblique function, which was concerned with live bodies in motion rather than the postmortem body evoked in the building’s floor plan., NR: 2013, Book ID: Architecture and the Body by Kim Sexton, Processed Text: obliqu function bodi motion sculptur qualiti build crucial parent theori obliqu function wa concern live bodi motion rather bodi build floor plan
TEXT:  With the oblique function, Parent and Virilio aimed to reinstantiate the body in architecture by activating it through the use of inclined planes, or ‘obliques’ (Figure 12.3). The cantilevering that constitutes the ground of the Ste-Bernadette ensures the visitor constantly feels the architecture whether fighting against gravity while walking down an incline or exerting physical force to ascend toward the altar; the architecture is an entity with which the visitor grapples., NR: 2014, Book ID: Architecture and the Body by Kim Sexton, Processed Text: obliqu function parent bodi architectur use plane obliqu figur ground visitor constantli feel architectur whether fight graviti walk inclin physic forc ascend toward altar architectur entiti visitor grappl
TEXT:  Declaring the end of the right angle and horizontality, Parent and Virilio argued that the dynamism of the oblique line was appropriate to a society undergoing rapid and seismic shifts, which Virilio in particular attributed to new technology and war, writing, ‘We are able to live in a state of disequilibrium., NR: 2015, Book ID: Architecture and the Body by Kim Sexton, Processed Text: end right angl horizont parent dynam obliqu line wa appropri societi undergo rapid seismic shift particular new technolog war write abl live state disequilibrium
TEXT:  Why then have we never used instability in the interior of our dwellings?’ (Virilio, 1966b, p. X). In general, the goal of materializing the oblique function was to oblige the body to work against gravity, engendering a more dynamic state than would otherwise be felt in conventional buildings with flat floor planes and ninety-degree angles., NR: 2016, Book ID: Architecture and the Body by Kim Sexton, Processed Text: never use instabl interior dwell gener goal obliqu function wa oblig bodi work graviti dynam state would otherwis felt convent build flat floor plane nineti degre angl
TEXT:  Virilio and Parent associated horizontality with stasis, and more specifically with an earlier, agrarian model of civilization that relied on flat farmlands, but which had become outmoded in the wake of the machine age (Virilio, 1966a, p., NR: 2017, Book ID: Architecture and the Body by Kim Sexton, Processed Text: parent associ horizont stasi specif agrarian model civil flat becom outmod wake machin age

TEXT:  Parent and Virilio believed that the use of inclined planes – sloped floors to destabilize the body’s relationship to architecture, and oblique expressions in architectural facades to create more dynamic edifices – would keep architecture apace with a ‘new plane of human consciousness’ (Virilio, 1966a, p., NR: 2020, Book ID: Architecture and the Body by Kim Sexton, Processed Text: parent use plane slope floor destabil bodi relationship architectur obliqu express architectur facad creat dynam edific would keep architectur apac new plane human conscious

TEXT:  Thus the image of the valiant, upright man is contravened many times over in the church of Ste-Bernadette: the whole body is replaced with an anatomized one, and the static body is set in motion. And of course, the male body with its ‘erection whose masculinity is obvious’ is inverted: it is the heart of a woman that forms the basic structure of the building, and the opening inside a cave is far more intra-uterine than a monolithic (phallic) tower., NR: 2025, Book ID: Architecture and the Body by Kim Sexton, Processed Text: thu imag valiant upright man mani time church whole bodi one static bodi set motion cours male bodi erect whose masculin obviou invert heart woman form basic structur build open insid cave far uterin monolith phallic tower

TEXT:  The idea of an oblique line came directly from the ruined bunkers, tilting into the sand and collapsing in on themselves. In order to fully understand the genesis of Ste-Bernadette, it is crucial to see how Virilio literally and symbolically framed the military technology in his photographs and attendant writings, an intellectual and affective exploration which would in turn inform the genesis of the church., NR: 2027, Book ID: Architecture and the Body by Kim Sexton, Processed Text: idea obliqu line came directli ruin bunker tilt sand order fulli understand genesi crucial see liter symbol frame militari technolog photograph attend write intellectu affect explor would turn inform genesi church

TEXT:  I use the term ‘bunker’ as Virilio did, in that it refers to a structure built by a military as fortification against attack.

TEXT:  Virilio’s writing suggests that he defined the bunker in the broadest terms as a ‘survival machine’, even using it to describe submarines and tanks (they were, he argued, mobile bunkers). In 1966, he published select photo graphs and writings related to the bunkers in Architecture Principe (1966c), but his most sustained meditation on military architecture would come in the form of a book published in 1975 (Virilio, 1994) for the exhibition ‘Bunker Archaeology’, held at the Museum of Decorative Arts in Paris., NR: 2030, Book ID: Architecture and the Body by Kim Sexton, Processed Text: write defin bunker term surviv machin even describ submarin tank mobil bunker select photo graph write relat bunker architectur sustain medit militari architectur would come form book exhibit bunker archaeolog museum decor art

TEXT:  But at various junctures in the book, Virilio abandons the role of a scientist for that of a philosopher or even an artist, and his system of classifications gives way to poetic meditations. This shift is particularly apparent in the final chapter of Bunker Archaeology entitled, ‘An Aesthetics of Disappearance’., NR: 2034, Book ID: Architecture and the Body by Kim Sexton, Processed Text: variou junctur book abandon role scientist philosoph even artist system classif give way poetic medit shift particularli appar final chapter bunker archaeolog aesthet disappear

TEXT:  175). Virilio’s reference to the ‘skin’ of the structure suggests an association with the body, an example of an anthropomorphic tendency that pervaded much of his writing on the bunkers. Virilio does not admit a clear distinction between the biological body and the mechanical sciences: the oscillation in Bunker Archaeology between the subjective, poetic rhetoric and the more objective tone of a scientist echoes the duality that Virilio perceived within the bunkers themselves, between the organic and the mechanical., NR: 2038, Book ID: Architecture and the Body by Kim Sexton, Processed Text: refer skin structur associ bodi exampl anthropomorph tendenc much write bunker doe admit clear distinct biolog bodi mechan scienc oscil bunker archaeolog subject poetic rhetor object tone scientist echo dualiti within bunker organ mechan

TEXT:  The bunker’s hybrid state between body and machine was one dictated by the technology of modern warfare. In that vein, Virilio describes the bunkers as: built to hold up under shelling and bombing, asphyxiating gasses and flamethrowers … the bunker was built in relationship to this new climate; its restrained volume, its rounded or flattened angles, the thickness of its walls, the embrasure systems, the various types of concealment for its rare openings, its armor plating, iron doors, and air filters—all this depicts another military space, a new climactic reality., NR: 2040, Book ID: Architecture and the Body by Kim Sexton, Processed Text: bunker hybrid state bodi machin wa one technolog modern warfar vein bunker built hold shell ga bunker wa built relationship new climat restrain volum round angl thick wall embrasur system variou type conceal rare open armor plate iron door air filter anoth militari space new climact realiti
TEXT:  (Virilio, 1994, p. 39) This new climactic reality was the effect of war’s infiltration of the skies, which had initiated, Virilio argued, a collapse between militarized and habitable space. Virilio noted that the tension between the ‘summer of seaside bathing’ and the ‘summer of combat’ – the flesh nourished and the flesh destroyed – would from then on be unceasing, pointing out the way in which these monuments of war colonized a terrain previously devoted to leisure., NR: 2041, Book ID: Architecture and the Body by Kim Sexton, Processed Text: new climact realiti wa effect war infiltr sky collaps habit space note tension summer seasid bath summer combat flesh flesh would unceas point way monument war terrain previous devot leisur
TEXT:  (Virlio, 1994, pp. 14–15). With the conclusion of World War II in 1945, the shells of those monuments remained, ruins destined to become ‘children’s playthings’ that nonetheless serve as vivid reminders of past war and perhaps ominous warnings of future conflict., NR: 2042, Book ID: Architecture and the Body by Kim Sexton, Processed Text: conclus world war shell monument ruin becom child playth nonetheless serv vivid remind past war perhap omin warn futur conflict
TEXT:  Owing to rapidly developing technologies, those future conflicts were likely to involve nuclear fallout: Virilio argued that reality was effectively dematerialized by the newfound ability to split atoms in the service of nuclear fission: The possibilities of weapons had become so great that the mineral element became a part of the fluidity of fluid; with the exception of rock, all the Earth is a part of the movement of the ocean, a mutation of physical territory, in fact the first type of ‘disintegration’ before the arrival of nuclear arms., NR: 2043, Book ID: Architecture and the Body by Kim Sexton, Processed Text: owe rapidli technolog futur conflict like involv nuclear realiti wa effect abil split atom servic nuclear fission possibl weapon becom great miner element part fluiditi fluid except rock earth part movement ocean mutat physic territori fact first type disintegr arriv nuclear arm
TEXT:  In truth, the principle of arms has always been aimed at this deconstruction, first of man’s body, of armor, then of the rampart built for his protection. (Virilio, 1994, p. 38) In fact, Virilio saw little distinction between the body, the armor, and the rampart, which fused in the form of the bunker., NR: 2044, Book ID: Architecture and the Body by Kim Sexton, Processed Text: truth principl arm ha alway first man bodi armor rampart built protect fact saw littl distinct bodi armor rampart fuse form bunker
TEXT:  He makes this clear by situating the bunker not only within a history of military architecture (trenches, embankments, towers) (Virilio, 1994, p. 38), but also within the developmental trajectory of body armor (the helmet, shield, shrapnel-proof vest)., NR: 2045, Book ID: Architecture and the Body by Kim Sexton, Processed Text: make clear bunker within histori militari architectur trench embank tower also within development trajectori bodi armor helmet shield shrapnel proof vest
TEXT:  He goes on to point out the linguistic slippage between the body and the rampart, writing, ‘There was … from the advent of armor, an analogy with fortification: one would speak of the “shirt” of a rampart, meaning the hard rock covering the slope, and of a “bastion,” meaning the knights’ coat of mail., NR: 2046, Book ID: Architecture and the Body by Kim Sexton, Processed Text: go point linguist slippag bodi rampart write wa armor analog fortif one would speak shirt rampart mean hard rock cover slope bastion mean knight coat mail
TEXT:  The relationship between clothing and dwelling is extremely tight during wartime’ (Virilio, 1994, p. 42). And finally, Virilio analogizes the firing slits in military bunkers to human eyes, which help with ‘the aim of protecting the inner organ’ (Virilio, 1994, pp., NR: 2047, Book ID: Architecture and the Body by Kim Sexton, Processed Text: relationship cloth dwell extrem tight wartim final fire slit militari bunker human eye help aim protect inner organ

The bunker: a modern cave While the church of Ste-Bernadette’s relationship to both the bunkers and the oblique function was readily evident, its evocation of a cave was perhaps less obvious (Figure 12., NR: 2048, Book ID: Architecture and the Body by Kim Sexton, Processed Text: case combat soldier aim target case anatom relic saint bunker modern cave church relationship bunker obliqu function wa readili evid evoc cave wa perhap less obviou figur
TEXT: 4). There is nothing particular in the architecture that refers to the Grotto of Masabielle where the saint experienced her vision. But both Parent and Virilio cited the Grotto as a source of inspiration, so we can assume that the building adopted the general guise of a cave through the paucity of windows, the ponderous façade, the relative absence of rectilinear forms in favor of organic curves, and the concrete that is not unlike natural rock in appearance., NR: 2049, Book ID: Architecture and the Body by Kim Sexton, Processed Text: noth particular architectur grotto saint experienc vision parent grotto sourc inspir assum build adopt gener guis cave pauciti window ponder facad rel absenc rectilinear form favor organ curv concret unlik natur rock appear

TEXT:  This fusion of the cave and the bunker extended beyond Virilio or Parent’s formulation, to the ways in which the leitmotif of the cave had been deployed within postwar French culture. Figure 12.4 Ste-Bernadette of Banlay, interior Photo: Arie Hartog/Liesbeth Klerken The cave was most fully resurrected within the French imagination following World War II, in the interest precipitated in large part by the discovery of the Lascaux caves in 1940 and their subsequent opening to the public in 1948., NR: 2051, Book ID: Architecture and the Body by Kim Sexton, Processed Text: fusion cave bunker extend beyond parent formul way cave within postwar cultur figur interior photo cave wa fulli within imagin follow world war interest precipit larg part discoveri cave subsequ open public

TEXT:  This brand of primitivism was distinct from the exoticist fascination with non-Western materials espoused by the of the Surrealists and others earlier in the twentieth century (Wilson, 1993, p. 34). Artists associated with postwar movements like Informel and Tachisme, such as Jean Dubuffet, Alberto Giacometti, and Germaine Richier, among others, shared an interest in what Wilson calls ‘primal matter’ (Wilson, 1993, p., NR: 2053, Book ID: Architecture and the Body by Kim Sexton, Processed Text: brand primitiv wa distinct exoticist fascin non western materi surrealist twentieth centuri artist associ postwar movement like jean among interest call primal matter
TEXT:  33), and Douglas Smith has noted that the thick impastos and roughly hewn figures by these same artists were often likened to the surfaces of prehistoric caves (Smith, 2004, p. 219).

TEXT:  In addition, Smith has argued that the proliferation of Lascaux-inspired imagery had a nationalistic import, as it was tied to the Gaullist effort to rehabilitate the French image in the wake of Nazi collaboration under the Vichy regime, during which time ‘blood-and-soil’ nationalism was touted in the guise of rural folklore and peasant life., NR: 2055, Book ID: Architecture and the Body by Kim Sexton, Processed Text: addit smith ha prolifer inspir imageri nationalist import wa tie effort rehabilit imag wake collabor regim time blood soil nation wa guis rural folklor peasant life
TEXT:  Because prehistoric archaeology did not factor into the collaborationist narrative, it could be resurrected as a symbol of national pride after the war (Smith, 2004, pp. 221–2). However, in the 1960s the meanings associated with the cave shifted from a symbol of cultural renewal suffused with nationalistic pride to, I argue, a more ambivalent marriage of militarism and technology, one in which the body rather than the building became the object of industrial science., NR: 2056, Book ID: Architecture and the Body by Kim Sexton, Processed Text: prehistor archaeolog factor narr could symbol nation pride war smith howev mean associ cave symbol cultur renew suffus nationalist pride argu ambival marriag militar technolog one bodi rather build object industri scienc
TEXT:  This shift is not a disconnect between the earlier postwar interest in the cave, but an intensification of themes that were already latent: in 1967, French Cultural Minister André Malraux published his memoirs, an account of his role in the French Resistance during the German Occupation, which included using the Lascaux caves to hide an arms cache: All subterranean caverns arouse disquiet, since a sudden caving-in could bury one alive there., NR: 2057, Book ID: Architecture and the Body by Kim Sexton, Processed Text: shift disconnect postwar interest cave intensif theme alreadi latent cultur minist memoir account role resist german occup includ cave hide arm cach subterranean cavern arous disquiet sinc sudden cave could buri one aliv

TEXT:  8) – or the parishioners who careen down the aisles of his fonction oblique church are not unlike the metal-clad models floating through Klein’s film. The models’ bodies are literally fortified with a machinic epidermis, whereas in Virilio’s design, the architecture conditioned the body to achieve a greater plane of physical (and as he would argue, psychic) prowess: rather than the fashion designer, in this context, it was the architecture that had reinvented the body for the nuclear age., NR: 2073, Book ID: Architecture and the Body by Kim Sexton, Processed Text: parishion careen aisl obliqu church unlik metal clad model float film model bodi liter epidermi wherea design architectur condit bodi achiev greater plane physic would argu psychic prowess rather fashion design context wa architectur bodi nuclear age
TEXT:  The film nodded to mid-sixties gender trouble much as the embodied church design did, at least on the theoretical plane.

TEXT:  As light streams in from a window and bounces off the surface of the gleaming metal, the female-phallus slowly rises upward. It is the birth of a new woman, part human, part machine, as the film’s Diana Vreeland character confirms to the show’s designer: ‘You’ve re-created woman!’ He responds, ‘We had to re-imagine woman for the nuclear age., NR: 2075, Book ID: Architecture and the Body by Kim Sexton, Processed Text: light stream window bounc surfac gleam metal femal phallu slowli rise upward birth new woman part human part machin film charact show design woman imagin woman nuclear age

TEXT:  When the camera focuses on the bleeding flesh wound, however small, the satire ebbs momentarily to reveal something more poignant and perhaps anxiety ridden.

TEXT:  From these scenes, two images of Polly become etched in the minds of viewers: first, a woman wounded, the violence inflicted by the very mechanized exterior meant to render the body beneath unassailable, and second, a machine-clad body, transformed and resplendent., NR: 2080, Book ID: Architecture and the Body by Kim Sexton, Processed Text: scene two imag becom mind viewer first woman wound violenc exterior meant render bodi beneath unassail second machin clad bodi resplend
TEXT:  The first woman is a martyr, proof that the transformation of woman for the nuclear age is not without risk. The latter is a saint, bathed in light and levitating, a vision of the new human-machine. While Parent and Virilio’s church paradoxically protected and entombed bodies by its mechanized exterior, Klein’s film pointed out the chinks in modernity’s armor., NR: 2081, Book ID: Architecture and the Body by Kim Sexton, Processed Text: first woman martyr proof transform woman nuclear age without risk latter saint light vision new human machin parent church paradox bodi exterior film point chink modern armor
TEXT:  Anxiety over the destruction of the body by modern warfare would not easily be put to rest by metaphor, architecture or science.

TEXT:  The body of the nuclear age, and its relationship to built form, was no longer the Cubist body of the early twentieth century as dissected by Frank Bauer in a previous chapter. Through bodily seeing, that body had transcended the physical, translating perceptual and psychological relationships of body and space into Cubist abstract form and suspension of scale and even genre., NR: 2084, Book ID: Architecture and the Body by Kim Sexton, Processed Text: bodi nuclear age relationship built form wa longer cubist bodi earli twentieth centuri dissect frank previou chapter bodili see bodi physic perceptu psycholog relationship bodi space cubist abstract form suspens scale even genr
TEXT:  But in the post-war world, spirituality and mysticism trumped psychology, and architectural scale, genre and referential rather than abstract form returned to extinguish and yet preserve. The church is its own death knell, and yet the heart motif suggests vitality; as an organ it facilitates circulation, a theme with which Parent and Virilio were quite literally concerned in their explorations of the oblique function., NR: 2085, Book ID: Architecture and the Body by Kim Sexton, Processed Text: post war world spiritu mystic psycholog architectur scale genr referenti rather abstract form return extinguish yet preserv church death knell yet heart motif vital organ circul theme parent quit liter concern explor obliqu function
TEXT:  In short, Ste-Bernadette was a paradoxical building in which conflicting themes converged.

TEXT:  The cantilevering of Ste-Bernadette derived from ruined bunkers along with its ground-plan based on human remains reflect contradictory modes of protecting the body: the pre-modern veneration of a saintly body, made unassailable by its holiness, combined with the mid-twentieth century realization that no body, however sacred, was inviolable in the face of increasingly mechanized modes of destruction brought about by war., NR: 2088, Book ID: Architecture and the Body by Kim Sexton, Processed Text: deriv ruin bunker along ground plan base human remain reflect contradictori mode protect bodi modern vener saintli bodi made unassail holi combin mid twentieth centuri realiz bodi howev sacr wa inviol face increasingli mode destruct brought war

In a family burial chapel, a theology of anatomization bridges medieval and early modern ways in which architecture intersected with science, only to return again in the case of a postwar church, the design of which was inspired by the heart of Saint Bernadette Soubirous – an organ which pathologists in 1928, still following good medieval practice(!) sought to remove from Bernadette’s exhumed body to verify her sanctity., NR: 2115, Book ID: Architecture and the Body by Kim Sexton, Processed Text: hold religion ha scienc historian scienc well know extraordinarili long perhap ha yet entir lose grip famili burial chapel theolog anatom bridg mediev earli modern way architectur scienc return case postwar church design wa inspir heart saint organ pathologist still follow good mediev practic sought remov bodi verifi sanctiti
