TEXT:  What is crucial here is the idea of replacing non-social production, which is isolated and then coordinated via the movement of things (monetary and commodity flows), with social production, which is ultimately communicative (and therefore coordinated with media that are alternatives to money), but not by means of state planning (it is no accident that the subtitle of the German translation of Ostrom’s book situates the commons “beyond market and state”)., NR: 27, Book ID: Society After Money Dialogue, Processed Text: crucial idea non social product isol via movement thing monetari commod flow social product ultim commun therefor medium altern money mean state accid subtitl german translat book common beyond market state

TEXT:  Instead this is about overcoming exchange (and thus the market and money) by means of a form of production that is still individual, but is no longer merely partial, but omnipotent. What does this mean? Under market conditions, every producer must exchange in the market (especially those who can only sell their labor), since it is only possible, individually, to produce a certain, small portion of goods (the division of labor is often equated with the principle of exchange, although it would be entirely possible to imagine a division of labor arranged by democratic and communicative means)., NR: 32, Book ID: Society After Money Dialogue, Processed Text: instead exchang thu market money mean form product still individu longer mere partial omnipot doe mean market condit everi produc must exchang market especi sell labor sinc possibl individu produc certain small portion good divis labor often principl exchang although would entir possibl imagin divis labor democrat commun mean
TEXT:  But if we had an “ideal machine of fabrication,” which really could produce anything we wanted, on the spot, then we would no longer need to exchange on markets, and would therefore no longer need money—as in the science fiction television series Star Trek: The Next Generation, where just such an ideal production machine, the Replicator, exists (see the chapter by Annette Schlemm in this volume)., NR: 33, Book ID: Society After Money Dialogue, Processed Text: ideal machin fabric realli could produc anyth spot would longer need exchang market would therefor longer need money scienc fiction televis seri star trek next gener ideal product machin see chapter volum
TEXT:  Such a machine would virtually cancel out capitalism all on its own, but without requiring a new communicative form and infrastructure, i.e. a social ex ante organization (though it would give rise to new conflicts, for example over the ownership of the data needed for production—if these were to remain private property and scarce, then capitalism based on 3D printers would also be conceivable; the same goes for the necessary energy and raw materials)., NR: 34, Book ID: Society After Money Dialogue, Processed Text: machin would virtual cancel capit without new commun form infrastructur social ant organ though would give rise new conflict exampl ownership data product remain privat properti scarc capit base printer would also conceiv go necessari energi raw materi

TEXT:  This is followed by a “trialogue,” that is, a deliberately multiperspectival discussion exploring whether money is to be defined as a commodity or as a medium.

TEXT:  David Graeber 1.1 Money as a Special Form of Economy In economics and sociology, universalist statements have often been made about the economic life of humans: general assumptions about the rationality of economic behavior (Homo oeconomicus), and assumptions about general forms of economic practice (exchange), and structural or functional principles of the economy (the division of labor, “economy as the communication of scarcity,” or the “adaptation of society to the environment”)., NR: 96, Book ID: Society After Money Dialogue, Processed Text: money special form economi econom sociolog universalist statement often made econom life human gener assumpt ration econom behavior homo assumpt gener form econom practic exchang structur function principl economi divis labor economi commun scarciti adapt societi environ

TEXT: 7 This also applies to money, a central phenomenon in today’s economy, and to the academic study of this phenomenon.

TEXT:  For example, it was a long-held belief that money had its origins in the exchange of goods for goods, as a way of simplifying this, and that humans had a “natural propensity” for exchange. Today this belief is increasingly being called into question: •Today there are a large number of studies with a focus on economic history which show that money did not develop, historically, from barter, but was constituted under specific social, cultural and psychological conditions as a relation of obligation., NR: 100, Book ID: Society After Money Dialogue, Processed Text: exampl wa long belief money origin exchang good good way human natur propens exchang today belief increasingli question today larg number studi focu econom histori show money develop histor barter wa specif social cultur psycholog condit relat oblig

TEXT:  •The historically oriented explanations for money and other relevant research on economic history also make it clear that the use of money, especially in its present ubiquitous form, is not a constant of human history; on the contrary, if we look back on the (currently accepted) 160,000 years of development of Homo sapiens, it is a historically recent phenomenon., NR: 102, Book ID: Society After Money Dialogue, Processed Text: histor explan money relev research econom histori also make clear use money especi present ubiquit form constant human histori contrari look back current accept year develop homo histor recent phenomenon
TEXT:  The development of money can be roughly outlined as follows.9 Before the emergence of coined money from about 800 BC, various forms of non-monetary exchange existed: ritual exchange, barter, and primitive money or commodity money (these last since the Neolithic period, from about 6000 BC)., NR: 103, Book ID: Society After Money Dialogue, Processed Text: develop money roughli outlin emerg money variou form non monetari exchang ritual exchang barter primit money commod money last sinc neolith period

TEXT:  Or at least: things were not (primarily) produced for exchange, but subsistence remained the basis of these societies.

TEXT:  With the end of the Roman Empire and the development of the feudal system in Europe, the use of money actually declined, and only gradually expanded again in the course of the Middle Ages.11 Only from the sixteenth century onwards, with the transformation of labor and land into commodities, did extensive money-based economic contexts develop (“capitalism”)., NR: 107, Book ID: Society After Money Dialogue, Processed Text: end empir develop feudal system use money actual declin gradual expand cours middl age sixteenth centuri onward transform labor land commod extens money base econom context develop capit

TEXT:  In social science research on money, for example, the structural difference between pre-capitalist and capitalist money becomes apparent in various ways. •From the perspective of a Marxist critique of political economy, it becomes clear that today’s money, in contrast to all other historically existing forms of money, is not only “obligation” or “debt,” but is always already capital, and that the use of money only occurs in connection with the historically specific social power relation that underlies this use: the exploitation of working non-owners by non-working owners, on the basis of free contracts between formally equal legal entities., NR: 109, Book ID: Society After Money Dialogue, Processed Text: social scienc research money exampl structur differ capitalist capitalist money becom appar variou way perspect critiqu polit economi becom clear today money contrast histor form money oblig debt alway alreadi capit use money connect histor specif social power relat use exploit work non owner non work owner basi free contract formal equal legal entiti
TEXT: 12 Here work and production no longer take place for the immediate satisfaction of needs, but for exchange, that is, for purposes of buying or selling.

TEXT:  Here money always embodies this underlying production relationship, and the structural social relationship of economic value which it creates. It should be stressed here that it is only under the condition of this specific power relation that money first ceases to play a merely secondary role in the satisfaction of needs, and that the acquisition of money becomes the universal prerequisite for life (Polanyi 2001)., NR: 111, Book ID: Society After Money Dialogue, Processed Text: money alway underli product relationship structur social relationship econom valu condit specif power relat money first ceas play mere secondari role satisfact need acquisit money becom univers prerequisit life

TEXT: 13 And it is only now that people can and must behave in a thoroughly selfish and calculated way toward each other. •One aspect of (modern) money, defined as capital, is that acts of exchange take place as elements of an overall system of interlocking circulations of capital (Pahl 2008: 15f., NR: 113, Book ID: Society After Money Dialogue, Processed Text: peopl must behav thoroughli selfish calcul way toward one aspect modern money defin capit act exchang take place element overal system circul capit
TEXT: , 152). This includes a functional relationship between different forms of capital, with credit as a central component of the system as a whole. Given society’s focus on the acquisition of money, and the linking of this acquisition to the generation of profit, credit inevitably develops into a core element of the functional context of capitalism (Heinrich 2003), even if it is only for fundamental investments or those made for reasons of competition, which cannot be financed from available funds or purely from profits., NR: 114, Book ID: Society After Money Dialogue, Processed Text: function relationship differ form capit credit central compon system whole given societi focu acquisit money link acquisit gener profit credit inevit core element function context capit even fundament invest made reason competit cannot avail fund pure profit
TEXT:  •Another aspect of the special, structural power relation arising from this is that “economics” develops an independent existence as a socially objective functional context with its own “dynamics.” The “anarchy of commodity production” (Friedrich Engels) emerging with the development of capitalism brings with it objective monetary phenomena such as inflation, specific growth parameters and crises, phenomena that are not deliberately created by anyone, but are the precondition for all economic actions, and are in turn a reflection of capital’s new, independent existence as an “automatic subject” (Marx)., NR: 115, Book ID: Society After Money Dialogue, Processed Text: anoth aspect special structur power relat econom independ exist social object function context dynam anarchi commod product develop capit object monetari phenomenon inflat specif growth paramet crisi phenomenon deliber anyon precondit econom action turn reflect capit new independ exist automat subject
TEXT: 14 This increasing independence is reproduced in and through action.15 •At the same time, this new independent existence of the economic has a specific societal dimension, which is often identified in sociology, and which constitutes a further specific social quality of capitalist society: the economy not only becomes independent in itself, that is, in the form of unintended dynamics resulting from the intentional economic actions of individuals, but at the same time it becomes independent of (or in sociological/functional terms: “differentiated” from) “society” (Habermas 1987; Polanyi 2001)., NR: 116, Book ID: Society After Money Dialogue, Processed Text: increas independ action time new independ exist econom ha specif societ dimens often sociolog specif social qualiti capitalist societi economi becom independ form unintend dynam result intent econom action individu time becom independ sociolog function term societi
TEXT:  •This historical process by which the economy acquires independence or is differentiated from society proves to have weighty consequences: with the “institutionalization of the medium of money” (Habermas) and the associated differentiation between the economy and society, society as a whole is “flying blind” in both economic and socio-cultural terms., NR: 117, Book ID: Society After Money Dialogue, Processed Text: histor process economi independ societi prof weighti consequ medium money associ differenti economi societi societi whole fli blind econom cultur term

TEXT: 18 Capitalist money thus proves to be not only a historically distinct phenomenon, but also a core component of a qualitatively new form of social coexistence. With these insights into the historical and qualitatively new character of money, the question of economic alternatives—a key question for movements critical of capitalism—now presents itself in a specific way: on the one hand, the insight into the historical characteristics of money opens our eyes to many other possible uses and forms of money., NR: 120, Book ID: Society After Money Dialogue, Processed Text: capitalist money thu prof histor distinct phenomenon also core compon qualit new form social coexist insight histor qualit new charact money question econom altern key question movement critic capit present specif way one hand insight histor characterist money open eye mani possibl us form money
TEXT:  On the other hand, the structure-oriented perspective on money allows a critical examination of reformist approaches to growth and money (in particular, the reformist ideas focused on ecology and a critique of growth which are prominent today), approaches based on a critique of interest, and approaches aiming at the abolition of deposit money creation., NR: 121, Book ID: Society After Money Dialogue, Processed Text: hand structur perspect money critic examin reformist approach growth money particular reformist idea ecolog critiqu growth promin today approach base critiqu interest approach aim abolit deposit money creation
TEXT:  All these approaches retain the idea of money as a general means of exchange, and face, each in their own specific way, a virtually insoluble problem.19 A few key objections (out of many more) are summarized here: •Growth cannot be simply slowed down, let alone stopped: either the economy grows or it shrinks chaotically., NR: 122, Book ID: Society After Money Dialogue, Processed Text: approach retain idea money gener mean exchang face specif way virtual insolubl problem key object mani growth cannot simpli let alon stop either economi shrink chaotic

TEXT:  But in light of the diverse ways of life that exist in today’s developed capitalism, this leads to a further question: What could a de-monetarized, i.e. a post-monetary economy be like? What forms of coordination and social organization can be imagined, under present-day conditions, if money ceases to exist or is reduced to a minor role? Before we turn to the possible answers that are given to this question, I think we first need to consider another aspect of the distinctiveness or limitations of money as a form of economic practice: the “blind flight” described above, driven by monetary considerations and organized along monetary lines, and unique in the history of humanity, must not hide the fact (as often happens in economics and the social sciences) that the imposition and perpetuation of the newly independent “system” has always been attended by a number of non-monetary practices., NR: 125, Book ID: Society After Money Dialogue, Processed Text: light divers way life exist today capit lead question could post monetari economi like form social organ present day condit money ceas exist reduc minor role turn possibl answer given question think first need consid anoth aspect distinct limit money form econom practic blind flight driven monetari consider organ along monetari line uniqu histori human must hide fact often econom social scienc imposit perpetu newli independ system ha alway number non monetari practic

The “logic” of thought, action and feeling within the context of capitalist reproduction can be discerned in various forms of social relationship and individual orientations: in competitive relationships and strategic attitudes toward other people, in a focus on abstract values (money), in the ideologies and practices of dominion over nature, in the subordination of thought, action and feeling to general “constraints” (often including the experience of powerlessness), and in an indifference toward the economic, ecological, social and sometimes even individual consequences of personal or collective action—going as far as the willingness to use pure force (violent appropriation of spaces and resources, enslavement, war) to achieve one’s goals., NR: 156, Book ID: Society After Money Dialogue, Processed Text: someth need explor greater detail consid possibl make post monetari economi subsist differ social logic logic thought action feel within context capitalist reproduct variou form social relationship individu orient competit relationship strateg attitud toward peopl focu abstract valu money ideolog practic dominion natur subordin thought action feel gener constraint often experi powerless indiffer toward econom ecolog social sometim even individu consequ person collect action go far willing use pure forc violent appropri space resourc enslav war achiev one goal

Is it conceivable that “resources” might be removed from the grasp of industry and made available for other forms of production? What about indigenous people, who (if they are asked) often do not want to participate in the industrial system? And finally, what if, in a “free” and “knowledge-oriented” society, processes of reflection take place which lead to other needs, not only “material,” but also social? What if, for example, many people wanted to produce in a manner that was self-organized, in harmony with nature, and did not involve any exchange? What if they even found ways in which this was possible for everybody? Would the industrial system be capable of transforming itself to meet the changed needs of the (many) people? For another thing, and connected to the above: in view of the “path dependencies” that come with industrial technology, how do these approaches deal with technological “progress,” in the sense of the emergence of “more efficient”/“more sustainable,” and usually non-industrial technologies (keywords: “fabbing,” “permaculture,” “cob building,” “alternative medicine”)?

Quoted in Habermann 2009: 203 This “do-ocracy” can be understood as a form of “social self-organization” which ultimately differs from the idea of “democracy”: “A do-ocracy … is an organizational structure in which individuals choose roles and tasks for themselves and execute them., NR: 346, Book ID: Society After Money Dialogue, Processed Text: volunt thing ocraci understood form social self organ ultim idea democraci ocraci organiz structur individu choos role task execut

TEXT: ” Here processes are developed which correspond to the logic of “distributed” and “open” systems and of “commoning,” such as the organizational principle of IT-supported “stigmergy,” i.e. task processing based on cues, as is familiar from Wikipedia: Stigmergy is the division of tasks on the basis of cues., NR: 402, Book ID: Society After Money Dialogue, Processed Text: process correspond logic distribut open system organiz principl task base cue familiar divis task basi cue
TEXT:  In Wikipedia, “red links” point to where another article could be written. There is a to-do list of what is still needed.

TEXT:  Self-selection has enormous consequences for motivation. I only choose jobs that I really, really want to do. This makes it clear that the development of stigmergy requires an absence of material constraints and external control., NR: 404, Book ID: Society After Money Dialogue, Processed Text: self select ha enorm consequ motiv choos job realli realli want make clear develop absenc materi constraint extern control
TEXT:  Stigmergy is reliant on the free development of individuality.

TEXT:  Hence stigmergy does not work well for small systems.

TEXT:  The aspiration to a consistent focus on needs gives rise to a single criterion, that the technology must be “adapted,” but this allows a multitude of concrete forms of technology. So it is not a matter of contrasting specific methods, such as “permaculture,” automatic machines and computers, or “fabbers”; instead it is about what people want within the framework of a needs-oriented form of production, and what technologies they create in “commoning., NR: 409, Book ID: Society After Money Dialogue, Processed Text: aspir consist focu need give rise singl criterion technolog must multitud concret form technolog matter specif method automat machin comput instead peopl want within framework need form product technolog creat

TEXT: ) Overall, then, we can retain a few key points which set these approaches apart from all the others presented so far: •Cooperation on a voluntary basis •Action based on “intrinsic motivation” (interest in a thing, the natural or “self-evident” human tendency to look after others) •Trust, as manifested in the uncoupling of giving and taking •Trust in people’s ability to cooperate or resolve conflicts while acknowledging their differences •Openness with regard to needs, organizational processes and technologies., NR: 411, Book ID: Society After Money Dialogue, Processed Text: overal retain key point set approach apart far voluntari basi action base intrins motiv interest thing natur self evid human tendenc look trust manifest give take trust peopl abil resolv conflict differ open regard need organiz process technolog
TEXT:  Despite its fundamental appeal, and the fact that it “works” in various respects, the approach is (still) likely to cause a certain unease from the present-day viewpoint.

TEXT:  Adorno The preceding remarks have shown that there are currently a large number of different theoretical and practical approaches to post-monetary life.

TEXT: 91 In contrast, “subsistence” (in a wide range of forms), “free economy,” open-source software, “free culture” and so on show that things can be done differently.

TEXT:  The discussion has thus made it very clear that today we no longer have to ask whether moneyless economic activity is possible, but whether it will happen, and if so how and when. With regard to the existing approaches, one fundamental observation to be made is that all of these are literally only approaches: they are first attempts, and not by any means complete “solutions,” since they always take place from within capitalism, and are therefore still influenced by it in various ways., NR: 420, Book ID: Society After Money Dialogue, Processed Text: discuss ha thu made clear today longer ask whether moneyless econom activ possibl whether happen regard approach one fundament observ made liter approach first attempt mean complet solut sinc alway take place within capit therefor still variou way

TEXT:  Whatever concrete shape a possible “society after money” will take, it is plain that all the approaches in this direction have always been transformatory movements on contested social terrain. Various lines of conflict can be discerned here: •An economic line of conflict runs between the formation and development of “solidarity-based economies” and their appropriation for new strategies of valorization, or between a non-commercial “economy of sharing” and a commercialized “sharing economy” (Metzger 2015; Lobo 2014)., NR: 426, Book ID: Society After Money Dialogue, Processed Text: whatev concret shape possibl societi money take plain approach direct alway movement social terrain variou line conflict econom line conflict run format develop solidar base economi appropri new strategi valor non commerci economi economi lobo
TEXT:  Another key area of conflict is the “capitalist permeation of reproduction” (Bauhardt 2012: 7), i.e. the progressive emergence of “care capitalism.” Here the development and implementation of a “different logic” of reproduction is, from a feminist perspective, an attempt to overcome not only economic “exploitation,” but also patriarchal forms of domination (Fraser 2017: 100)., NR: 427, Book ID: Society After Money Dialogue, Processed Text: anoth key area conflict capitalist permeat reproduct progress emerg care capit develop implement differ logic reproduct feminist perspect attempt overcom econom exploit also patriarch form domin
TEXT:  •Politically, the conflict is about defending forms of “solidarity-based economy” against the current policies of growth, which are generally held up as being the only possible option. This is about combatting labor-market policies focused solely on integrating people into paid work, containing the progressive “marketization” of resources, cultures and identities, and fighting for the freedom to develop social “testing grounds” (Helfrich and Bollier 2015)., NR: 428, Book ID: Society After Money Dialogue, Processed Text: polit conflict form solidar base economi current polici growth gener possibl option labor market polici sole peopl work progress resourc cultur ident fight freedom develop social test ground
TEXT: 94 An essential prerequisite for this is finding a solution to the fundamental economic policy dilemma of present-day politics: parliamentary politics will only be able to support alternative/moneyless economies to a very limited extent, as long as it is primarily obliged to support “growth” as the foundation for its own capacity to act—on the basis of a capitalist economic order which it has institutionalized., NR: 429, Book ID: Society After Money Dialogue, Processed Text: essenti prerequisit find solut fundament econom polici dilemma present day polit parliamentari polit abl support altern moneyless economi limit extent long primarili oblig support growth foundat capac act basi capitalist econom order ha
TEXT:  At the same time, this “growth” generates an ever greater subjective and objective need for post-capitalist, alternative/moneyless economic methods. To escape from the “growth spiral” (Binswanger), then, we would need concrete economic policy strategies of orderly contraction., NR: 430, Book ID: Society After Money Dialogue, Processed Text: time growth ever greater subject object need post capitalist altern moneyless econom method escap growth spiral would need concret econom polici strategi orderli contract
TEXT:  These, however, do not yet exist (Herrmann 2015b).95 •Another essential prerequisite for any increase in social emancipation is the development of pluralist “civil society” cultures. This means that in social and cultural respects, the conflict is about securing recognition for different ways of life in practical and theoretical contexts, against the spread of exclusionary and discriminatory attitudes., NR: 431, Book ID: Society After Money Dialogue, Processed Text: howev yet exist anoth essenti prerequisit increas social emancip develop pluralist civil societi cultur mean social cultur respect conflict recognit differ way life practic theoret context spread exclusionari discriminatori attitud

TEXT:  This view is supported by the fact that objective certainties are being lost, by the critical and socio-psychological self-reflection of society, and by practical experience of social movements.

Money: The Segregated Universal Commodity In volume I of Capital, Marx explains what he sees as the fundamental difference between his critique of political economy and that of classical economists: It is one of the chief failings of classical economy that it has never succeeded, by means of its analysis of commodities, and in particular of their value, in discovering the form of value which in fact becomes exchange-value., NR: 716, Book ID: Society After Money Dialogue, Processed Text: understood capitalist wealth abstract wealth contrari classic understand money form integr compon capitalist wealth money univers commod volum capit see fundament differ critiqu polit economi classic economist one chief fail classic economi ha never mean analysi commod particular valu form valu fact becom exchang valu

TEXT:  From this perspective, commodities’ social dimension consists in their representation of a specific sum of exchange value, or value. To put it another way, social mediation occurs via the products of labor and, consequently, via labor itself (see Postone 1993: 148–157) and it is only with this in mind that there can be any discussion of the fact that abstract labor forms the substance of value., NR: 728, Book ID: Society After Money Dialogue, Processed Text: perspect commod social dimens represent specif sum exchang valu valu put anoth way social mediat via product labor consequ via labor see mind discuss fact abstract labor form substanc valu

TEXT:  4. From Commodity Fetish to Money Fetish to Capital Fetish Bourgeois economics seeks to perceive a decidedly rational economic system in the capitalist mode of production.

TEXT:  The commodity is a fetish because human social relations slip into the products of their labor and, consequently, confront people in this material form as an external force.

TEXT:  Commodities’ exchange value dimension takes on a life of its own and becomes a special object that exists distinct from particular commodities—the stand-alone, universal commodity.

TEXT:  In Marx’s analysis, capital is, in the first place, a social process comprised of three metamorphoses7 in which value is “transformed into an automatic subject” (Marx 1990: 255) of the valorization of value through the exploitation of the particular use value of the labor commodity., NR: 761, Book ID: Society After Money Dialogue, Processed Text: analysi capit first place social process compris three metamorphosi valu automat subject valor valu exploit particular use valu labor commod

However, apart from capital formation through the exploitation of the labor commodity’s capacity to produce (surplus) value, which is a familiar topic in Marxist discussions, there is also a second variant that is omitted from those conversations: the relation that is mediated by the sale of the money-capital commodity can also produce abstract wealth., NR: 775, Book ID: Society After Money Dialogue, Processed Text: correspondingli reproduct also product social relat howev apart capit format exploit labor commod capac produc surplu valu familiar topic discuss also second variant convers relat sale money capit commod also produc abstract wealth
TEXT:  Capital formation decoupled from actual valorization of value is no mere subjective delusion. Like the commodity and money fetishes, the capital fetish is a real fetish.

TEXT:  Private functioning and fictitious capital might have been devalued, but never the universal commodity: with the change in the money commodity, its very creation becomes a moment in the process of capitalist accumulation, which also means that, during major crises, the devaluation process can, in principle, also encroach on the monetary medium as a whole—a development that was absolutely impossible when gold was the money commodity., NR: 855, Book ID: Society After Money Dialogue, Processed Text: privat fictiti capit might never univers commod chang money commod creation becom moment process capitalist accumul also mean major crisi devalu process principl also encroach monetari medium whole develop wa absolut imposs gold wa money commod
TEXT:  Marx explained how devaluation crises progress under the gold standard. On the one hand, during crises, the particular commodities that constitute functioning capital are devalued.

TEXT:  When central banks reduce interest rates and increase their own “money creation,” they can prevent impending credit squeezes and thereby take action against the devaluation of particular commodities.

But the absence of a term for abstract wealth, on one hand, and the equation of commodity wealth with wealth in material use values, on the other, are not the only reasons why the prevailing line of reasoning mistakes the process of demonetizing gold (which reached its conclusion in 1971) with the de-commodification of money., NR: 880, Book ID: Society After Money Dialogue, Processed Text: think blind spot ineluct truth chang money commod look like disappear absenc term abstract wealth one hand equat commod wealth wealth materi use valu reason line reason mistak process gold conclus money

TEXT:  Because conventional economics both mixes up capitalist wealth with wealth in goods and assumes that its functionalist concept of money is always authoritative, it presents the process of “dematerializing” money as conclusive evidence of the correctness of the nominalist concept of money., NR: 902, Book ID: Society After Money Dialogue, Processed Text: convent econom mix capitalist wealth wealth good functionalist concept money alway authorit present process money conclus evid correct nominalist concept money
TEXT:  But it immunizes against ideas of a money commodity by blocking access to a workable analysis of the modern money system before it can even get started. 10. Crisis in the Ideology of Money as a Simple Medium for the Movement of Commodities Since the days of Adam Smith, economists have been selling the capitalist mode of production as a particularly rational way of distributing consumer goods and money as a simple medium for the movement of commodities., NR: 903, Book ID: Society After Money Dialogue, Processed Text: idea money commod block access workabl analysi modern money system even get crisi ideolog money simpl medium movement commod sinc day smith economist sell capitalist mode product particularli ration way consum good money simpl medium movement commod
TEXT:  This misleading perspective primarily owes its pseudo-plausibility to two conditions that characterize the circulation of functioning capital.

TEXT:  If one looks only at individual exchange acts and abstracts from the overall capitalist process, it does seem more natural to interpret the dual motion of buying and selling as a mediated exchange of commodities instead of the aimlessly self-justifying motion from money to more money., NR: 905, Book ID: Society After Money Dialogue, Processed Text: one look individu exchang act abstract overal capitalist process doe seem natur interpret dual motion sell exchang commod instead aimlessli self justifi motion money money
TEXT:  This is all the more true when we consider that there is a broad swath of market participants for whom money really is only a medium for moving commodities. People who sell their labor do so only to then be able to buy the commodities they need to meet their life necessities with the money they earn., NR: 906, Book ID: Society After Money Dialogue, Processed Text: true consid broad swath market particip money realli medium move commod peopl sell labor abl buy commod need meet life necess money earn
TEXT:  But successfully selling the labor commodity has a social precondition: labor sellers can only acquire money when they can find a buyer for whom the application of their labor fits into a process of transforming money into more money., NR: 907, Book ID: Society After Money Dialogue, Processed Text: success sell labor commod ha social precondit labor seller acquir money find buyer applic labor fit process transform money money
TEXT:  The conventional concept of money does not take this detail into account. By conceiving money as a simple means for moving commodities, it explains the content of capitalist economic activity as a C–M–C motion and obscures the fact that it consists of a self-justifying C–M–C’ motion., NR: 908, Book ID: Society After Money Dialogue, Processed Text: convent concept money doe take detail account money simpl mean move commod content capitalist econom activ motion fact self justifi motion
TEXT:  Money absolutely does function as a universal means of circulation, but only insofar as it is integrated into the circulation of capital valorization. The obscuring conditions outlined here explain why the underlying incorrect assumptions in economic theory have been so tenacious and have been served up again and again since Adam Smith’s time., NR: 909, Book ID: Society After Money Dialogue, Processed Text: money absolut doe function univers mean circul insofar circul capit valor condit outlin explain underli incorrect assumpt econom theori tenaci sinc smith time
TEXT:  But the capitalist system has undergone a change (particularly in recent decades) that undermines the plausibility of the prevailing concept of money from a completely different angle.

TEXT:  What else are we to think of a concept of money that stubbornly defines it on the basis of its function with respect to goods market commodities when the bulk of money resides in financial markets and money mediates the movement of stocks, bonds and derivatives?

TEXT:  The paradigm of capitalism as a rational mode of production has also come under increasing pressure, particularly in recent years. Neither the continually broadening swath of ecological and social devastation that has battered the capitalist economic system nor the constantly renewed episodes of crisis that have convulsed the global capitalist system since the start of the century fit neatly with the primordial myth of liberalism and Western civilization., NR: 913, Book ID: Society After Money Dialogue, Processed Text: paradigm capit ration mode product ha also come increas pressur particularli recent year neither continu swath ecolog social devast ha batter capitalist econom system constantli episod crisi global capitalist system sinc start centuri fit neatli primordi myth liber western civil

Marx and the Blind Spots in the New Debate Around Money If we were to search the historical theories for concepts of money that comprehend its modern incarnation as a genuinely irrational and metaphysical thing, we would not be burdened with an overabundance., NR: 918, Book ID: Society After Money Dialogue, Processed Text: blind spot new debat around money search histor theori concept money comprehend modern incarn genuin irrat metaphys thing would overabund

TEXT:  In its search for potential theoretical reference points, we might therefore expect that the new debate around money would look to the concept of money found in the critique of political economy and sound out its explanatory power—all the more so given that Marx is no longer generally regarded as a dead dog and his name has at least re-entered circulation as a token., NR: 920, Book ID: Society After Money Dialogue, Processed Text: search potenti theoret refer point might therefor expect new debat around money would look concept money found critiqu polit economi sound explanatori power given longer gener dead dog name ha least circul token
TEXT:  Yet Marx’s theory of money as the segregated universal commodity has been completely disregarded in the current debate.

TEXT:  Blind adoption of that incorrect association is certainly one reason why the newly aroused interest in the question of money has been paralleled by a widespread disinterest in Marx’s approach. But there is something else that is significantly more important: while the new debate about money does attack individual theorems of mainstream economics, it does so without critically assessing its underlying false axioms., NR: 922, Book ID: Society After Money Dialogue, Processed Text: blind adopt incorrect associ certainli one reason newli interest question money ha widespread disinterest approach someth els significantli import new debat money doe attack individu theorem econom doe without critic underli fals axiom

TEXT:  It thus exclusively refers to the capitalist mode of production, in which the commodity has become the universal form of wealth. As such, it argues in purely logical terms that attempt to decipher the internal logic of this social formation in which money occupies a key position and has a historically specific character that cannot be deduced from any of the various universal histories of money that span multiple modes of production., NR: 926, Book ID: Society After Money Dialogue, Processed Text: thu exclus capitalist mode product commod ha becom univers form wealth pure logic term attempt deciph intern logic social format money key posit ha histor specif charact cannot variou univers histori money span multipl mode product
TEXT:  To attempt to do so is to essentially treat money as an entity that is external to capitalist society—one that always remains the same and has only ever changed in superficial ways. This makes it seems obvious to derive the irrationality of today’s money system from a fundamentally unchanging essence of money—a very pronounced tendency in today’s debate around money., NR: 927, Book ID: Society After Money Dialogue, Processed Text: attempt essenti treat money entiti extern capitalist societi one alway remain ha ever superfici way make obviou deriv irration today money system fundament unchang essenc money pronounc tendenc today debat around money

TEXT:  David Graeber, ethnologist and pioneer of the Occupy movement, took that approach to profoundly critique Adam Smith’s monetary origin myth and received a certain amount of ideological credit for it. In his book Debt: The First 5000 Years, he uses extensive ethnological material to expose the evolution of money from exchange as exactly what it is: a purely ideological construct., NR: 930, Book ID: Society After Money Dialogue, Processed Text: ethnologist pioneer occupi movement took approach profoundli critiqu smith monetari origin myth receiv certain amount ideolog credit book debt first year us extens ethnolog materi expos evolut money exchang exactli pure ideolog construct
TEXT:  But as the title of his bestseller indicates, he replaces Smith’s ontology of exchange with a no less misleading ontology of debt. Contemporary credit relations, which represent the most significant form of trade with the commodity money capital, look to him like the extension of sanctified personal debt relations by other means., NR: 931, Book ID: Society After Money Dialogue, Processed Text: titl smith ontolog exchang less mislead ontolog debt contemporari credit relat repres signific form trade commod money capit look like extens sanctifi person debt relat mean
TEXT:  But relative to classical or contemporary mainstream economics, this is not a step forward in knowledge. Instead, it is only an inversion of the existing projection: whereas the exchange-ontology perspective projects the dissolution of society into isolated private producers (a characteristic feature of the modern capitalist mode of production) onto prehistory, Graeber views the modern credit system through the lens of pre-modern personal debt relations., NR: 932, Book ID: Society After Money Dialogue, Processed Text: rel classic contemporari econom step forward knowledg instead invers project wherea exchang ontolog perspect project dissolut societi isol privat produc characterist featur modern capitalist mode product onto prehistori view modern credit system len modern person debt relat
TEXT:  But modern credit relations must be understood simply as a specific variant of objectified commodity relations.

TEXT:  That may correspond to the personifying notions of common sense and that is not the least of the reasons why it is so popular. But in analytical terms, it is a misleading path.

TEXT:  That is a shortcoming that more or less characterizes the entire body of recent criticism of money, which in turn is an outcome of those texts’ initial premise. For all the differences in their argumentation, anyone who claims that only the “sacrificial religious” core (Türcke 2015) of earlier forms of money is reproduced in the modern financial system or that money is “backed by human bodies” (von Braun 2012) is assuming that money, in the end, has essentially always remained the same., NR: 936, Book ID: Society After Money Dialogue, Processed Text: shortcom less entir bodi recent critic money turn outcom text initi premis differ argument anyon claim sacrifici religi core form money modern financi system money back human bodi assum money end ha essenti alway

TEXT:  Money gives the exchange-value side of particular commodities a form that is separate from their specific use values; it allows exchange value to face the world of commodities as a power unto itself. The prevailing thinking is fooled by this fetishistic illusion and treats money as though it were a thing that actually exists outside the system of commodity production and were not merely an externalized, tangible form of the internal contradictions of the world of commodities., NR: 939, Book ID: Society After Money Dialogue, Processed Text: money give exchang valu side particular commod form separ specif use valu exchang valu face world commod power unto think fetishist illus treat money though thing actual outsid system commod product mere tangibl form intern contradict world commod

TEXT:  The representatives of the new debate around money knowingly disengage from the “classical and neoclassical monetary oblivion” (Pahl 2008: 9).

TEXT:  This, however, is a questionable perspective. To adopt it is to risk drifting toward a complementary version of the old two-worlds concept. The development of the capitalist mode of production has always been accompanied by a regressive “anti-capitalism” that attacks a given financial or monetary order as an occupying force that is alien to the commodity society and pushes away responsibility for the evils of the capitalist form of socialization., NR: 942, Book ID: Society After Money Dialogue, Processed Text: howev question perspect adopt risk drift toward complementari version old two world concept develop capitalist mode product ha alway regress anti capit attack given financi monetari order forc alien commod societi push away respons evil capitalist form social

On the other hand, as long as the fundamental structure of the prevailing form of socialization (the dissolution of society into isolated private producers) remains hidden behind its material form (money), not only will the analytic scope of the new debate around money remain limited, but it may even provide the material for ideologically regressive approaches to processing the crisis., NR: 949, Book ID: Society After Money Dialogue, Processed Text: light tremend import financi industri accumul today overal capitalist process examin mysteri world monetari indispens hand long fundament structur form social dissolut societi isol privat produc remain hidden behind materi form money analyt scope new debat around money remain limit may even provid materi ideolog regress approach crisi

TEXT:  Rather, the sphere of circulation brings about the transformation of the production of goods into a means for producing value. That is the underlying logic when Marx writes: “There is an antithesis, immanent in the commodity, between use-value and value, between private labor, which must simultaneously manifest itself as directly social labor, and a particular concrete kind of labor which simultaneously counts as merely abstract universal labor, between the conversion of things into persons and the conversion of persons into things; the antithetical phases of the metamorphosis of the commodity are the developed forms of motion of this immanent contradiction” (Marx 1990, 209)., NR: 966, Book ID: Society After Money Dialogue, Processed Text: rather sphere circul transform product good mean valu underli logic antithesi imman commod use valu valu privat labor must simultan manifest directli social labor particular concret kind labor simultan count mere abstract univers labor convers thing person convers person thing antithet phase metamorphosi commod form motion imman contradict

How did it come into being and is its origination still instructive for the understanding of money today? If not from a supposedly natural urge to barter, how do markets come into being? •What are the current real practices through which money comes into being and ceases to exist? •How does the economy function as a monetary system? What is the logic of this type of material reproduction?4 •What forms of crises and destabilization result from this process? •What relationships result from this system? What types of actions, which were previously entirely unthinkable, can now develop? What is the “contribution” of money to the coordination of the global system?

TEXT:  What Is Money? Genesis of the Monetary Economy5 Money is elementary and ubiquitous in our society—its understanding, however, is not. The dominant theory’s conception of money—namely, that of the neoclassical school and its off-shoots—as a neutral means of exchange is a fatal mistake, based on the historical speculations of distinguished pioneers of economics6 who were not able to draw on the extensive historical, ethnographic and anthropological knowledge on the subject that we have today., NR: 997, Book ID: Society After Money Dialogue, Processed Text: money genesi monetari economi money elementari ubiquit societi understand howev domin theori concept money name school shoot neutral mean exchang fatal mistak base histor specul distinguish pioneer econom abl draw extens histor ethnograph anthropolog knowledg subject today

TEXT:  Banks do not provide credit by loaning money, but rather by granting the borrower (sight-)deposits in an account at their bank. As a rule, these titles to money that are accorded by the bank are described as deposit money: a concept that is, on the one hand, infelicitous, since it is precisely not a matter of money—just as little as a theater ticket is a performance, to paraphrase Keynes21—but, on the other hand, is understandable, since the relinquishment of titles to money between bank customers—better known as transfers22—are accepted as payment exactly as if one had received the money in cash., NR: 1027, Book ID: Society After Money Dialogue, Processed Text: bank provid credit money rather borrow sight deposit account bank rule titl money bank deposit money concept one hand infelicit sinc precis matter money littl theater ticket perform paraphras hand understand sinc relinquish titl money bank custom better known transfer accept payment exactli one receiv money cash

TEXT:  The deposits accorded by banks are many times greater than the money issued—and are also not subject to any indirect control by the central bank.23 On the aggregate, the deposits equal the debt. Hence, a bank “creates” no money, but, at most, credit; it produces no money and also does not lend any, but rather it accords titles to money., NR: 1029, Book ID: Society After Money Dialogue, Processed Text: deposit bank mani time greater money also subject indirect control central bank aggreg deposit equal debt henc bank money credit produc money also doe lend rather accord titl money
TEXT:  This money-denominated documentation of monetary claims is always prior to the appearance of “new” money in the two-tier banking system.24 3. Economic Dynamics If all deposits are based on debt and all debt is burdened with interest and (in part) a money tax (the discount rate), hence if, as a whole, more must be repaid as there is in circulation and economic actors, moreover, withdraw money from circulation by way of retaining profits, then the economy is a kind of chain letter: a Ponzi scheme., NR: 1030, Book ID: Society After Money Dialogue, Processed Text: money document monetari claim alway prior appear new money two tier bank system econom dynam deposit base debt debt interest part money tax discount rate henc whole must circul econom actor moreov withdraw money circul way retain profit economi kind chain letter scheme
TEXT:  Paul C. Martin (1988, 1990) has developed this idea in the most consistent fashion. On his account, the dynamic of the capitalist system—or, as he puts it, the “debtist” system—is based on the fact that debtors are always under pressure to repay their loans and, to this end, are always dependent on new debtors to settle their debt and therefore later on an even higher level of general debt, in order to assure that these loans too remain serviceable until they come due., NR: 1031, Book ID: Society After Money Dialogue, Processed Text: martin ha idea consist fashion account dynam capitalist system put system base fact debtor alway pressur repay loan end alway depend new debtor settl debt therefor later even higher level gener debt order assur loan remain servic come due

TEXT: 27 From his chain-letter thesis, Martin thus draws the logical consequence from the assumption of an absence of interest, of profit and of all savings in the circulation of money, which would make it at least theoretically possible for debtors to repay their debt, pithily noting: “All of capitalism consists of nothing more than a (to the greatest extent possible) frictionless process of piling up debt” (Martin 1990: 82f., NR: 1037, Book ID: Society After Money Dialogue, Processed Text: chain letter thesi martin thu draw logic consequ assumpt absenc interest profit save circul money would make least theoret possibl debtor repay debt pithili capit noth extent possibl frictionless process pile debt martin

TEXT:  It is true that, using a simulation, Steve Keen demonstrates that the effect of lacking interest payments does not necessarily emerge. He thus takes his distance from the position that is not only defended by Martin, but has been discussed among post-Keynesians for some twenty years now: namely, that not only profits, but (on the assumption of stable quantities) even interest payments appear not to be possible on the level of the economy as a whole (Rochon 2005: 125)., NR: 1040, Book ID: Society After Money Dialogue, Processed Text: true simul keen effect interest payment doe necessarili emerg thu take distanc posit martin ha among post twenti year name profit assumpt stabl quantiti even interest payment appear possibl level economi whole

TEXT:  Keen’s model is, however an unrealistic representation:32 above all, because in this scenario banks do not pursue any expansion of their own business (instead interest payments flow into consumption) and because it is assumed that the profits of businesses, despite falling returns (which, in the end, tend toward zero), are always reinvested at the same level—to say nothing of the absence of any savings., NR: 1043, Book ID: Society After Money Dialogue, Processed Text: keen model howev unrealist represent scenario bank pursu expans busi instead interest payment flow consumpt assum profit busi despit fall return end tend toward zero alway level say noth absenc save

TEXT:  The danger of deflation is near when further loans can no longer be taken out, either because collateral has been devalued or repayment is seen as precarious, or when there is no longer the desire to take out more loans, since they are not regarded as lucrative., NR: 1108, Book ID: Society After Money Dialogue, Processed Text: danger deflat near loan longer taken either collater ha repay seen precari longer desir take loan sinc lucr
TEXT:  More debt is repaid than is assumed; demand falls, making prior investments unprofitable and new ones unattractive; unemployment rises.

TEXT:  5. Society Without Money The foregoing makes clear the profound significance that the development of economic rationality by way of monetary systems had for human development. There are societies without money: simple societies, which live sustainably and do not recognize ownership rights, but do indeed recognize possession., NR: 1110, Book ID: Society After Money Dialogue, Processed Text: societi without money forego make clear profound signific develop econom ration way monetari system human develop societi without money simpl societi live recogn ownership right inde recogn possess
TEXT:  In any case, there is not much in them that would provoke envy. They are held together by a strong sense of solidarity, which is, for the most part, based on a network of kinship relations. Their size rarely surpasses the so-called Dunbar number of approximately 120 persons, such that everyone knows everyone else well enough to know about their social positioning too., NR: 1111, Book ID: Society After Money Dialogue, Processed Text: case much would provok envi togeth strong sens solidar part base network kinship relat size rare number approxim person everyon know everyon els well enough know social
TEXT:  They are mostly consensus-oriented societies, which, for the most part, are highly resistant to the integration of foreigners (which is not to say that they do not display hospitality), have developed only a relatively low technological and medical level, have known relatively little innovation in their history, and have a conservative outlook., NR: 1112, Book ID: Society After Money Dialogue, Processed Text: mostli consensu societi part highli resist integr foreign say display hospit rel low technolog medic level known rel littl innov histori conserv outlook
TEXT:  This is probably not the model that one understands by a post-monetary society. The basis for the current complexity of society is not equality, cooperation, consensus, and solidarity in the spirit of tribal communities, but rather an entirely different form of sociality., NR: 1113, Book ID: Society After Money Dialogue, Processed Text: probabl model one post monetari societi basi current complex societi equal consensu solidar spirit tribal commun rather entir differ form social
TEXT:  An important pillar of this type of sociality has been described in monetary mechanisms and their peculiar economic logic of evolution: debt pressure and pressure to innovate; competition; role differentiation; coordination and disciplining by way of wage-labor; expansion of production and consumption, etc., NR: 1114, Book ID: Society After Money Dialogue, Processed Text: import pillar type social ha monetari mechan peculiar econom logic evolut debt pressur pressur innov competit role differenti way wage labor expans product consumpt
TEXT:  All of this has central social importance, because monetary relations account for a large part of the action coordination that is necessary for social reproduction.

TEXT:  Action coordination is the core of sociality. Now, money—in conjunction with the necessity of systems of power and legal systems (or, in other words, of states)—is the means that makes coordination effectively possible in complex societies without cooperation, without trust, and without personal knowledge of the other person., NR: 1116, Book ID: Society After Money Dialogue, Processed Text: action core social money conjunct necess system power legal system word state mean make effect possibl complex societi without without trust without person knowledg person
TEXT:  In this sense, our complex society is in desperate need of money, since it is the substitute for solidarity. The regrettable side-effect is that greed and self-aggrandizement are no longer laughed at, like in tribal societies, but rather become the behavioral standard., NR: 1117, Book ID: Society After Money Dialogue, Processed Text: sens complex societi desper need money sinc substitut solidar regrett side effect greed self aggrandiz longer like tribal societi rather becom behavior standard
TEXT:  Money replaces solidarity as basic social principle, since it integrates individuals in a complex structure—above all, by way of organizations.

TEXT:  Industrialization would not have been conceivable merely through the (indispensable) use of fossil fuels, as well as technical knowledge. It also required modern forms of financing, and this “unfettering of the productive forces” (Marx), along with the compulsion for growth and stable states founded on the rule of law, led to unprecedented (temporary?) success for the human species., NR: 1119, Book ID: Society After Money Dialogue, Processed Text: would conceiv mere indispens use fossil fuel well technic knowledg also modern form product forc along compuls growth stabl state rule law led unpreced temporari success human speci

TEXT:  If one follows the argumentation, the significance of money for action coordination and hence sociality itself becomes clear. Initiation and discipline are internalized by way of the pressure for self-preservation and the pressure of debt or they provide direct motivation for stronger or weaker forms of subordination as salaried employees in organizations., NR: 1127, Book ID: Society After Money Dialogue, Processed Text: one argument signific money action henc social becom clear initi disciplin way pressur self preserv pressur debt provid direct motiv form subordin salari employe organ

TEXT:  If one grasps organizations as entities capable of taking action, it would hardly be false to classify corporations, above all, as psychopaths.59 The monetary economy enables both extreme inequality and extreme prosperity, such that the poor in welfare states have a higher standard of living than the greater part of the global population—to say nothing of the around 1 percent of the richest people who hold 40 percent of the wealth (the richest 10 percent of the population holds around 85 percent)., NR: 1133, Book ID: Society After Money Dialogue, Processed Text: one grasp organ entiti capabl take action would hardli fals corpor psychopath monetari economi extrem inequ extrem prosper poor welfar state higher standard live greater part global popul say noth around percent peopl hold percent wealth percent popul hold around percent

TEXT:  But this idea is already highly problematic in light of the logic of expenditure in power systems. Historically, such an idea led to a total inflationary devaluation of money.

TEXT:  Polanyi (1957, 1968, [1944] 2001) makes this clear for feudal systems as well. Crawford (1970), Dalton (1965, 1967, 1971, 1982), and Frazer ([1890] 1996) have shown that in tribal societies, it is not exchange, but rather particular socio-institutional structures that regulate production., NR: 1222, Book ID: Society After Money Dialogue, Processed Text: make clear feudal system well dalton frazer shown tribal societi exchang rather particular institut structur regul product

Wray (1998, 2002, 2004, 2005) and Martin (2001, 2003, 2008) also take up this point: they make the important suggestion to replace the exchange paradigm by the property paradigm and they distinguish between three different forms of material reproduction—solidarity, command and property societies—of which only the latter is regarded as an economy., NR: 1223, Book ID: Society After Money Dialogue, Processed Text: refut exist market economi feudal see martin also take point make import suggest replac exchang paradigm properti paradigm distinguish three differ form materi reproduct solidar command properti societi latter economi

TEXT:  It was only after their definitive failure that the era of paper money arrived in Europe. 21He is referring, however, to confusion about the value of money (Keynes 1914: 402). 22In the case of transfers between different banks, the banks have to move around real deposits in their central bank accounts (hence real money); since, however, reciprocal obligations can be balanced in inter-bank transactions as a whole, only a fraction of real money has to be moved around in the overall circulation of titles to money., NR: 1238, Book ID: Society After Money Dialogue, Processed Text: wa definit failur era paper money howev confus valu money case transfer differ bank bank move around real deposit central bank account henc real money sinc howev reciproc oblig balanc inter bank transact whole fraction real money ha around overal circul titl money

TEXT:  Backhaus 2011), can be distinguished from this traditional version (b). Without wanting to suppress the differences among them, I would formulate what is common among these latter strands as follows: Money or monetary forms are attributed a key position in modern society or in capitalist economy, whereas in the traditional Marxist interpretation, they are often regarded as a kind of appendage of the (labor-value theoretical, production-centered) so-called real economy., NR: 1273, Book ID: Society After Money Dialogue, Processed Text: distinguish tradit version without want suppress differ among would formul common among latter strand money monetari form key posit modern societi capitalist economi wherea tradit interpret often kind appendag labor valu theoret product center real economi
TEXT:  In the form-critical interpretations, money—or, more exactly, generalized monetary circulation—is attributed a specific logic.

TEXT:  In the case of the conceptualization of money as medium, the situation is also relatively complex.

TEXT:  For the “money as medium” nexus, I would, to start with, distinguish at least three different discursive lines: On the one hand, there is the association of a medium with the idea of neutrality (c).

TEXT:  If one thinks of money in this way as a medium, then one finds oneself in direct proximity to neoclassical economics, in which there is also the idea (which is deeply embedded in the corresponding theoretical structure of equilibrium theory) that money is only a veil and, ultimately, economically neutral., NR: 1277, Book ID: Society After Money Dialogue, Processed Text: one think money way medium one find oneself direct proxim econom also idea deepli correspond theoret structur equilibrium theori money veil ultim econom neutral
TEXT:  From the latter, we can distinguish, firstly, the sociological discourse about money as a symbolically-generalized medium of communication (Luhmann [1988] 1994: 230–271; Luhmann refers to Talcott Parsons, who already early on described money as a medium) (d)., NR: 1278, Book ID: Society After Money Dialogue, Processed Text: latter distinguish firstli sociolog discours money symbol gener medium commun parson alreadi earli money medium

TEXT:  On the other hand, there is hardly any treatment of money coming from these quarters—at least, there is little of which I am aware. Perhaps we can proceed as follows: Ernst first gives us a couple of bars on the Marxian conception of money as the commodity that has been set apart from other commodities and Jens gives us a couple on the agenda of media theory?

TEXT:  This is, however, incompatible with the prevailing conception of money in economics. In the case of the neoclassical theory that sets the tone, this is immediately obvious.

TEXT:  The question of what gives money its character as an autonomous social power cannot even be formulated on this basis. It has already been defined away in the monetary-theoretical premises. If one takes off the traditional Marxian glasses in considering the Marxian critique of political economy and takes its fetishism-critical direction seriously, then the core points about the significance of money read like a counter-program to the dominant technicist-functionalist money concept., NR: 1288, Book ID: Society After Money Dialogue, Processed Text: question give money charact autonom social power cannot even basi ha alreadi defin away monetari theoret premis one take tradit glass consid critiqu polit economi take fetish critic direct serious core point signific money read like counter program domin technicist functionalist money concept
TEXT:  As “true power and the sole end” (Marx 1964: 155), money, on the basis of the capitalist mode of production, represents a social absolute for Marx.

TEXT:  1. Introduction: The Unclear Theoretical Situation Firstly: In standard works in monetary theory (e.g. Ingham 2005: xiii–xvi), the definition of money as a sort of commodity is attributed to both neoclassical and Marxist theory and is opposed to other definitions of money as either (a) based on debt/credit or (b) on the state or (c) as unit of account., NR: 1325, Book ID: Society After Money Dialogue, Processed Text: introduct unclear theoret situat firstli standard work monetari theori definit money sort commod theori oppos definit money either base debt credit state unit account
TEXT:  The dichotomy that Ernst draws between money as a neutral medium in neoclassical economics (“veil of money”) and as “actual community,” as autonomous social power (perhaps as the “automatic subject” of society), in Marxian theory presupposes a specific, as Hanno says, form-critical (value-critical) reading of Marxian theory, which hardly plays any role in debates in monetary theory., NR: 1326, Book ID: Society After Money Dialogue, Processed Text: dichotomi draw money neutral medium econom veil money actual commun autonom social power perhap automat subject societi theori specif say form critic valu critic read theori hardli play role debat monetari theori
TEXT:  This is not a criticism. It is, for the moment, merely intended to show how unclear the theoretical situation is.

TEXT:  Confusingly, however, it does so precisely in the presentation of those approaches in which “money takes its properties from its status as a commodity” (Ingham 2005: xi). This means that for Ingham, the definition of money as medium of exchange goes together precisely with that of money as commodity—which is indeed supported by Ernst’s observation that Marx describes money as a commodity, but also expressis verbis as “the physical medium into which exchange values are dipped” (Marx 1973: 167)., NR: 1328, Book ID: Society After Money Dialogue, Processed Text: confusingli howev doe precis present approach money take properti statu commod mean definit money medium exchang go togeth precis money commod inde observ money commod also physic medium exchang valu dip

TEXT:  (I will come back to this point.) Thirdly: In media theory—to the extent that it is at all possible to come to agreement about what is included in it and what is not—there are, as Hanno correctly notes, at least two camps that can be distinguished: on the one hand, the sociological media theories in which money since at least the 1960s has been understood as medium—in Luhmann ([1988] 1994) then as “symbolically generalized medium of communication”—and which are taken up by authors like Norbert Bolz (2008: 90–100); and, on the other—for lack of more precise concepts—all the rest., NR: 1330, Book ID: Society After Money Dialogue, Processed Text: come back point thirdli medium theori extent possibl come agreement includ correctli note least two camp distinguish one hand sociolog medium theori money sinc least ha understood medium symbol gener medium commun taken author like lack precis concept rest
TEXT:  In McLuhan, there is already in 1964 a somewhat strange chapter on money in his classical media-theoretical book Understanding Media; later, Winkler (2004: 36–49), Krämer (2005) and Seitter (2002: 179–196) write a couple of pages on money here and there; Hörisch (1996, 2004, 2011, 2013) even writes a few books on the subject., NR: 1331, Book ID: Society After Money Dialogue, Processed Text: alreadi somewhat strang chapter money classic medium theoret book understand medium later write coupl page money even book subject

TEXT:  Firstly: Ernst cites Marx: “In this sense every commodity is a symbol, since, as value, it is only the material shell of the human labor expended on it” (Marx 1976: 185), and he reads this passage as proof that Marx rejected the symbol theory of money as “illusionary., NR: 1339, Book ID: Society After Money Dialogue, Processed Text: firstli cite sens everi commod symbol sinc valu materi shell human labor read passag proof symbol theori money illusionari
TEXT: ” For Marx continues: “But if it is declared that the social characteristics assumed by material objects, or the material characteristics assumed by the social determinations of labor on the basis of a definite mode of production, are mere symbols, then it is also declared, at the same time, that these characteristics are the arbitrary product of human reflection” (Marx 1976: 185–186)., NR: 1340, Book ID: Society After Money Dialogue, Processed Text: declar social characterist assum materi object materi characterist assum social determin labor basi definit mode product mere symbol also declar time characterist arbitrari product human reflect
TEXT:  I interpret this passage as follows: Marx is right (perhaps without wanting to be so2): Every commodity is a symbol. The apple on the tree is not,3 but as a commodity, it “has” the “value” of “0.99 euros,” inasmuch as a sign that is somehow associated with it presents this price., NR: 1341, Book ID: Society After Money Dialogue, Processed Text: interpret passag right perhap without want everi commod symbol appl tree commod ha valu inasmuch sign somehow associ present price
TEXT:  Having an exchange-value means referring to this exchange-value in one way or another (even if it is just a matter of someone saying, “It costs 0.99 euros”). Being a commodity means being connected to a symbol for a certain exchange-value., NR: 1342, Book ID: Society After Money Dialogue, Processed Text: exchang valu mean exchang valu one way anoth even matter someon say cost commod mean connect symbol certain exchang valu
TEXT:  A commodity is an object with a use-value that has been made into a medium of exchange-value (or was already produced as such). Ernst is thus right when he criticizes the, as he puts it, “habitual” idea (which perhaps also characterizes neoclassical economics) that only money is symbolic and commodities or “goods” are the “real values” (whatever that is supposed to mean4)—an idea from out of which there also arises the idea that the “unreal,” “purely symbolic” financial industry distorts the “real economy” by being superimposed upon it., NR: 1343, Book ID: Society After Money Dialogue, Processed Text: commod object use valu ha made medium exchang valu wa alreadi produc thu right put habitu idea perhap also econom money symbol commod good real valu whatev suppos mean idea also idea unreal pure symbol financi industri real economi superimpos upon
TEXT: 5 Secondly: But this actually has nothing to do with the fact of being a “mere symbol” or an “arbitrary product of human reflection.” As a buyer, it is, namely, difficult for me to change the associated price as I please6 and even resellers have only a limited scope., NR: 1344, Book ID: Society After Money Dialogue, Processed Text: secondli actual ha noth fact mere symbol arbitrari product human reflect buyer name difficult chang associ price pleas even limit scope
TEXT:  This is just as difficult as inventing a new word for objects as one pleases (i.e. if I still want to be understood).

TEXT:  But such practices are not only hindered by the material constitution of current price tags (they get ruined), but also by the laws, which are imposed by force, if necessary.

TEXT:  This is why being the bearer of a symbol does not mean being a “mere symbol,” since the price is a symbol that is stabilized with extreme violence. Hence, to describe money as a symbolic system does not necessarily mean “mystifying it as a non-commodity,” as Ernst claims—it can also mean formulating more precisely what actually connects commodity and money., NR: 1349, Book ID: Society After Money Dialogue, Processed Text: bearer symbol doe mean mere symbol sinc price symbol extrem violenc henc describ money symbol system doe necessarili mean non commod claim also mean precis actual commod money

TEXT:  It can do this, because the value is precisely not in the apple—“not an atom,” as Marx says: Every moment, in calculating, accounting etc., that we transform commodities into value symbols, we fix them as mere exchange values, making abstraction from the matter they are composed of and all their natural qualities., NR: 1352, Book ID: Society After Money Dialogue, Processed Text: valu precis appl atom say everi moment calcul account transform commod valu symbol fix mere exchang valu make abstract matter compos natur qualiti
TEXT:  On paper, in the head, this metamorphosis proceeds by means of mere abstraction; but in the real exchange process a real mediation is required, a means to accomplish this abstraction.

TEXT:  Symbols cannot exist without material bearers—a basic assumption of media theory. Thus, “value symbols” historically have different and changing material bearers: from gold coins to bitcoins.8 Or as Marx put it, in media-theoretical terms: “If a symbol is not to be arbitrary, certain conditions are demanded of the material in which it is represented” (Marx 1973: 145)., NR: 1354, Book ID: Society After Money Dialogue, Processed Text: symbol cannot exist without materi bearer basic assumpt medium theori thu valu symbol histor differ materi bearer gold coin put medium theoret term symbol arbitrari certain condit materi

TEXT:  I would like here to take up one of Ernst’s formulations: “In certain functions—for instance, in that of means of circulation—money, the ‘independent value shape of commodities’ (Marx [1867] 1983: 76), can ‘be replaced by mere symbols of itself’ (Marx 1976: 185)., NR: 1356, Book ID: Society After Money Dialogue, Processed Text: would like take one formul certain function instanc mean circul money independ valu shape commod mere symbol

TEXT:  If money can be replaced by “mere symbols,” then it must already have been symbolic before.9 This also applies for gold and the forms it takes: for example, as coins.

TEXT:  I would, however, like to suggest that gold too was never and is not valuable “in itself” and also does not have any intrinsic value due to the fact that it is so difficult to mine, etc.10 The point is that it combines sufficient scarcity with properties like divisibility, countability and, above all, durability., NR: 1359, Book ID: Society After Money Dialogue, Processed Text: would howev like suggest gold wa never valuabl also doe intrins valu due fact difficult mine point combin suffici scarciti properti like divis durabl
TEXT:  As Ernst once put it, it is suitable as “bearer of value,” because a precious metal is chemically relatively stable—the very idea of a currency based on soap bubbles is absurd. Medial stability is evidently not extraneous to money, Gold coins are thus not “intrinsic” money that—as Ernst puts it—“in certain functions, for instance, in that of means of circulation, can ‘be replaced by mere symbols of itself’”—but rather they are a type of symbol that can be translated into another., NR: 1360, Book ID: Society After Money Dialogue, Processed Text: put suitabl bearer valu preciou metal chemic rel stabl idea currenc base soap bubbl absurd medial stabil evid extran money gold coin thu intrins money put certain function instanc mean circul mere symbol rather type symbol anoth

TEXT:  Today, the scarcity and stability mechanisms are of a different sort (counterfeiting protection, etc.); and in light of the massive infrastructure in fiber optics, server farms, etc., that is needed for electronic monetary transactions, it is difficult to claim that money has become more “immaterial., NR: 1362, Book ID: Society After Money Dialogue, Processed Text: today scarciti stabil mechan differ sort protect light massiv infrastructur fiber optic server farm electron monetari transact difficult claim money ha becom immateri
TEXT: ” Hence, one can conclude that there is no contradiction at all between the description of money as “general commodity” and as “medium”—on the contrary: One can only explain the setting apart of money, by basing it on the symbolic character of commodity and money., NR: 1363, Book ID: Society After Money Dialogue, Processed Text: henc one conclud contradict descript money gener commod medium contrari one explain set apart money symbol charact commod money
TEXT:  4. Autonomization Ernst writes: “In money, the social relations of people take on an autonomous objective shape,” and he cites Marx: “The individual carries his social power, as well as his bond with society, in his pocket” (Marx 1973: 157)., NR: 1364, Book ID: Society After Money Dialogue, Processed Text: money social relat peopl take autonom object shape cite individu carri social power well bond societi pocket

TEXT:  The point here is that “social relations” take on an autonomous form. Money is not simply a means to an end, but rather its increase (M–C–M’) becomes the main end.

TEXT:  To this extent, Marx’s thesis that money is not only a “cleverly devised expedient,”11 but rather, as Ernst puts it, an “autonomous social power” is very close to the positions of media theory12 (as, in any case, much in Marx reads like media theory avant la lettre)., NR: 1370, Book ID: Society After Money Dialogue, Processed Text: extent thesi money cleverli expedi rather put autonom social power close posit medium theori case much read like medium theori
TEXT:  But Marx—as Ernst indicates—rejected precisely the comparison between language and money (cf. Marx 1973: 162–163). Above all, he emphasizes the following difference. Whereas an abstract concept like “the animal” only exists in thought and speech—and does not really exist alongside particular animals—precisely this is supposed to be the case for the “real abstraction,” money: “the animal” is supposed, so to say, really to exist alongside the concrete animals., NR: 1371, Book ID: Society After Money Dialogue, Processed Text: precis comparison languag money follow differ wherea abstract concept like anim thought speech doe realli exist alongsid particular anim precis suppos case real abstract money anim suppos say realli exist alongsid concret anim

TEXT:  It is the act of exchange—i.e. of comparing the symbols on price tags and bills, of “comparison with money” (Marx 1973: 190)—that first creates value as equivalent.

TEXT:  It exists in a performative manner. This can undoubtedly be criticized as a “circulation-ideological” reduction of value—but nobody is saying that such processes only occur in exchange on markets.

TEXT:  (1) I think it is important to recall what explanatory function value theory is supposed to perform. By way of his thesis of a necessary connection between commodities and money, Marx attempts to capture a basic motor activity of capitalist synthesis, with the aim of being able to “derive” conclusions about the development of modern capitalism that are as definitive as possible., NR: 1395, Book ID: Society After Money Dialogue, Processed Text: think import recal explanatori function valu theori suppos perform way thesi necessari connect commod money attempt captur basic motor activ capitalist synthesi aim abl deriv conclus develop modern capit definit possibl

TEXT:  As an analytical point of departure, I think that the Marxian conception is unrivaled. For me, the resulting mode of research is another question.

TEXT:  He there conjectures: It would have been too much to expect Marx to have foreseen that the very ontology of the physical world was also experiencing metamorphosis in his lifetime, and yet, it can be argued that the scientific community’s transition from substance to field had some influence on his understanding of the labor theory of value, in that there ended up being not one but two Marxian labor theories of value: the first rooted in the older substance tradition, the other sporting resemblances to nascent field theories in physics., NR: 1406, Book ID: Society After Money Dialogue, Processed Text: conjectur would much expect ontolog physic world wa also metamorphosi lifetim yet scientif commun transit substanc field influenc understand labor theori valu end one two labor theori valu first root older substanc tradit sport resembl nascent field theori physic
TEXT:  Mirowski 1999: 177 It follows that one would have further to discuss the question of the coherence of the Marxian position.

TEXT:  Faßler speaks of a second-order sociality that is set in motion with abstract figures, signs, calculations, symbols, and representation and is reproduced by way of the inheritance of systems of abstraction, plans, writings, sketches, instructions, and that is more and more strongly influencing the modes of socio-cultural development (Faßler 2014: 79)., NR: 1414, Book ID: Society After Money Dialogue, Processed Text: second order social set motion abstract figur sign calcul symbol represent way inherit system abstract plan write sketch instruct strongli mode cultur develop

TEXT:  Jens has already noted that money has been hardly addressed in media-theoretical research: at least in the line of research that descends from Kittler. This is perhaps due to Kittler’s (political or theoretical-political) stance of taking the greatest possible distance from Marx and from the Frankfurt School., NR: 1416, Book ID: Society After Money Dialogue, Processed Text: ha alreadi note money ha hardli medium theoret research least line research perhap due polit theoret polit stanc take possibl distanc school

TEXT:  For what Kittler identifies as the blind spots of the humanities and of (Marxist) sociology—viz. the focus of the one on “meaning” and of the other on “labor,” whereby the (medial) conditions of possibility of meaning and labor are hidden from view—has a clear proximity to the Marxian critique of political economy (or, today, of mainstream economics): Marx’s criticism, intended for Smith and Ricardo, that, “entirely under the influence of material interests,” they overlooked the form-aspects of economic categories in a way that is analogous to how “before Hegel, professional logicians … overlooked the formal content of the types of judgments and syllogisms” (Marx [1867] 1983: 32) has at least an entirely analogous structure., NR: 1418, Book ID: Society After Money Dialogue, Processed Text: blind spot human sociolog focu one mean labor wherebi medial condit possibl mean labor hidden view ha clear proxim critiqu polit economi today econom critic intend smith entir influenc materi interest form aspect econom categori way analog profession logician formal content type judgment syllog ha least entir analog structur

TEXT:  This may be too schematically constructed, and, of course, matters prove to be more complex, when one brings in concrete historical studies.

TEXT:  Ernst Lohoff 1. What We Are Arguing About In my initial contribution, I sketched out the Marxian concept of money as general commodity (that has been set apart from other commodities) on the background of a fetishism-critical interpretation of the critique of political economy; and, in this context, I posed the question of what relation this concept has to attempts to draw on media-theoretical approaches to solve the riddle of money., NR: 1422, Book ID: Society After Money Dialogue, Processed Text: initi contribut concept money gener commod ha set apart commod background fetish critic interpret critiqu polit economi context question relat concept ha attempt draw medium theoret approach solv riddl money
TEXT:  Jens seems to have interpreted my reflections as if they led to declaring the two approaches to be incompatible. I feel that I have been a bit misunderstood. For me, the question is not so much “whether money is to be understood as ‘commodity that has been set apart from other commodities’ or as ‘medium’” (Jens), but rather how we can concretely conceive of these two definitions., NR: 1423, Book ID: Society After Money Dialogue, Processed Text: reflect led two approach incompat feel bit misunderstood question much whether money understood commod ha set apart commod medium rather concret conceiv two definit

TEXT:  When money appears as social symbol in the Grundrisse, this is because for Marx as critic of fetishism all commodities, without exception, represent social symbols or social ciphers—and hence, of course, so too does the general commodity., NR: 1430, Book ID: Society After Money Dialogue, Processed Text: money social symbol critic fetish commod without except repres social symbol social cipher henc cours doe gener commod
TEXT:  On the basis of the Marxian critique of fetishism, being a social symbol and having value objectivity is not a contradiction, but rather one and the same thing. But Marx was completely alone in this. Already at the time, in all other theoretical contexts, ascribing a symbolic character to money meant declaring it to be in essence a non-commodity and denying its value objectivity., NR: 1431, Book ID: Society After Money Dialogue, Processed Text: basi critiqu fetish social symbol valu object contradict rather one thing wa complet alon alreadi time theoret context symbol charact money meant essenc non commod valu object
TEXT:  Marx took his distance from this view, when he rejected the conception of money as mere symbol. In our time, however, the position that Marx combated is more than ever the consensus. In light of the foregoing, it is absolutely indispensable consistently to hold the front against the idea that money, in contrast to commodities, has a symbolic character., NR: 1432, Book ID: Society After Money Dialogue, Processed Text: took distanc view concept money mere symbol time howev posit ever consensu light forego absolut indispens consist hold front idea money contrast commod ha symbol charact
TEXT:  A very similar problem is posed by the media concept. That money is a social mediator is obvious. It would be absurd to deny its status as medium.

TEXT:  It is the “externalized expression of the form of social mediation that constitutes capitalist society” (Postone 1993: 265).

TEXT:  This already points to the fact that the depth dimension of the Marxian analysis vanishes in such an exchange-centered argumentation. But another aspect is more important for our topic. As I already emphasized in my first statement, Marx grasps money as the externalization of the inner contradiction of the commodity, inasmuch as it, on the one hand, represents abstract exchange-value and, on the other, has a particular use-value., NR: 1445, Book ID: Society After Money Dialogue, Processed Text: alreadi point fact depth dimens analysi exchang center argument anoth aspect import topic alreadi first statement grasp money extern inner contradict commod inasmuch one hand abstract exchang valu ha particular use valu

TEXT:  Money no longer derives from the dual character of the commodity, as in Marx, but rather it is only meeting up with money in the act of exchange that first converts simple things into commodities.

TEXT:  He thus derived the character of the product as commodity directly from the transformation of the production of wealth into private labor. 4. Thought Abstraction and Real Abstraction This logical status of money as the necessarily objectified form of appearance of basic social mediation via private labor and the products of private labor does not negate its own medial character, but it does make money a medium sui generis., NR: 1453, Book ID: Society After Money Dialogue, Processed Text: thu deriv charact product commod directli transform product wealth privat labor thought abstract real abstract logic statu money necessarili form appear basic social mediat via privat labor product privat labor doe negat medial charact doe make money medium
TEXT:  Above all, money exhibits a peculiarity to which, as far as I know, there is no parallel among other media. For the money commodity as derivative medium to confront the cosmos of many particular commodities as “the absolute existence of exchange-value” (Marx [1857–1858] 1953: 919) and general commodity, it must itself represent capitalist wealth., NR: 1454, Book ID: Society After Money Dialogue, Processed Text: money exhibit peculiar far know parallel among medium money commod deriv medium confront cosmo mani particular commod absolut exist exchang valu gener commod must repres capitalist wealth

TEXT:  The general commodity thus has the same content as that which it mediates. Marx essentially sets out from this substantive equivalence, when he grasps money as real abstraction, and, in order to elucidate the comparison with the animal kingdom that I have cited, notes: “It is as if next to and apart from lions, tigers, hares and all other really existing animals …, there existed also the animal, the individual incarnation of the whole animal kingdom., NR: 1456, Book ID: Society After Money Dialogue, Processed Text: gener commod thu ha content essenti set substant equival grasp money real abstract order elucid comparison anim kingdom note next apart lion tiger hare realli anim also anim individu incarn whole anim kingdom
TEXT:  Such an individual, which in itself comprises all really existent sorts of the same thing, is a universal: like animal, God, etc.” (Marx [1867] 1983: 37). Jens does not consider the inner connection between private labor and the commodity character of human products., NR: 1457, Book ID: Society After Money Dialogue, Processed Text: individu realli exist sort thing univers like anim god doe consid inner connect privat labor commod charact human product
TEXT:  Thus the equivalence between commodity and money appears as a process of abstraction that is, as it were, externally imposed on products of labor in exchange. The substantive identity between the money commodity, as the general representative of the system of private labor, and particular commodities, which each represent a particular form of private labor, is thus made invisible., NR: 1458, Book ID: Society After Money Dialogue, Processed Text: thu equival commod money process abstract extern product labor exchang substant ident money commod gener repres system privat labor particular commod repres particular form privat labor thu made invis
TEXT:  This is why Jens rejects the view that there is a fundamental difference between the money medium and other media, such as language, for instance. Jen first summarizes the Marxian argument: Whereas an abstract concept like “the animal” only exists in thought and speech—and does not really exist alongside particular animals—precisely this is supposed to be the case for the “real abstraction,” money: “the animal” is supposed, so to say, really to exist alongside the concrete animals., NR: 1459, Book ID: Society After Money Dialogue, Processed Text: reject view fundament differ money medium medium languag instanc first argument wherea abstract concept like anim thought speech doe realli exist alongsid particular anim precis suppos case real abstract money anim suppos say realli exist alongsid concret anim
TEXT:  And this would be a fundamental difference. But it is not. It is an entirely ordinary observation that orders of signs exist parallel to orders of things and mutually relate to one another.

TEXT:  Thus, although I only used an arbitrary sign for the apple, the real apple is changed (here its position, etc.). A few lines further on, Jens draws his conclusion: “Language is not only descriptive and/or abstractive, but also performative., NR: 1461, Book ID: Society After Money Dialogue, Processed Text: thu although use arbitrari sign appl real appl posit line draw conclus languag descript abstract also perform
TEXT:  It is not always only ‘mere symbol,’ which passively represents something real, but it can also intervene as symbol and change the real.” There is no question about it: Jen’s assessment of language is entirely correct., NR: 1462, Book ID: Society After Money Dialogue, Processed Text: alway mere symbol passiv someth real also interven symbol chang real question assess languag entir correct
TEXT:  Language undoubtedly has a performative character and, like all media, it affects that which it mediates. But Marx’s core argument is not at all that language only passively reflects reality. What is at issue for him in the distinction between thought abstraction and real abstraction is rather the specific character of the process of abstraction for which money stands., NR: 1463, Book ID: Society After Money Dialogue, Processed Text: languag undoubtedli ha perform charact like medium affect core argument languag passiv realiti issu distinct thought abstract real abstract rather specif charact process abstract money stand
TEXT:  Even if language changes extra-linguistic reality, it always remains a system of signs in a reality that is not only linguistic.

TEXT:  It is otherwise in the case of money. In the general commodity, the exchange-value of particular commodities takes on an independent absolute form of existence. 5.

TEXT:  This is because we are each operating with different concepts of the categories of commodity and value. This is not only evident in the case of particular commodities.

TEXT:  I insist on the fact that every monetary system is based on a money commodity, which provides backing for the legal means of payment.

TEXT:  The possessions of the central banks constitute the foundation of the monetary system. Precious metals stored in the vaults of the central banks occupied this key position in the era of gold-backing.

TEXT:  It is also compatible with the common practice in economics of defining money by way of its functions.

TEXT:  The monetary system is differentiated. From this point of view, the hundred euro bill is not a commodity at all, but rather, as a worthless piece of paper, it merely refers to the general commodity.

TEXT:  Banknotes of a central bank that, as “equivalent” for the issued central bank money, only had claims in the books that need to be written off would not be worth the paper on which they are printed.

TEXT:  Despite his wanting to think about the character of money as general commodity with a symbolic character, it is hard to distinguish his train of thought from this common interpretative model.

TEXT:  This is why being the bearer of a symbol does not mean being a ‘mere symbol,’ since the price is a symbol that is stabilized with extreme violence.” It is undoubtedly correct that the state imposes the bourgeois property order with its legal code and its monopoly of violence; but this is something other than securing the social validity of money and “monetary stability” (i., NR: 1481, Book ID: Society After Money Dialogue, Processed Text: bearer symbol doe mean mere symbol sinc price symbol extrem violenc undoubtedli correct state bourgeoi properti order legal code monopoli violenc someth social valid money monetari stabil

TEXT:  On the one hand—which Ernst, unfortunately, does not thematize—Marx says that “not an atom of matter enters into the objectivity of commodities as values” (Marx 1976: 138) and, on the other (if, in part, critically), that commodities themselves can be understood as symbols—which Ernst also affirms: “Being a social symbol and having value objectivity is not a contradiction, but rather one and the same thing., NR: 1494, Book ID: Society After Money Dialogue, Processed Text: one hand unfortun doe say atom matter object commod valu part critic commod understood symbol also social symbol valu object contradict rather one thing

TEXT:  Ernst argues, however, that the peculiar character of money lies in the fact that money is a different type of medium and has a different type of ontology (which raises the questions of whether it is, then, a medium at all): “Even if my use of the word ‘apple’ can bring a real apple into my possession, the word as such never becomes a real apple., NR: 1508, Book ID: Society After Money Dialogue, Processed Text: howev peculiar charact money lie fact money differ type medium ha differ type ontolog rais question whether medium even use word appl bring real appl possess word never becom real appl

TEXT:  Ernst Lohoff In his contribution, Hanno cites Philip Mirowski (1999: 177) and his suggestion that there are “not one but two Marxian labor theories of value,” and he adds: “It follows that one would have again to discuss the question of the coherence of the Marxian position., NR: 1520, Book ID: Society After Money Dialogue, Processed Text: contribut cite suggest one two labor theori valu add one would discu question coher posit
TEXT: ” I can only join him in calling for such a discussion. Precisely as concerns the foundation of his critique of political economy, Marx left behind a theory that is anything but self-contained and free of contradiction., NR: 1521, Book ID: Society After Money Dialogue, Processed Text: join call discuss precis concern foundat critiqu polit economi left behind theori anyth self free contradict
TEXT:  This is all the more the case, inasmuch as a deeper fissure runs through the Marxian value concept than that which Mirowski took as the occasion to speak of “two Marxian theories of value.” Even if the value concept of classical political economy and the physiological concept of labor, which emerged decades later and borrowed from the physical conception of “energy expenditure,” are not identical, they are related as variants of a trans-historical and positive concept of labor value., NR: 1522, Book ID: Society After Money Dialogue, Processed Text: case inasmuch fissur run valu concept took occas speak two theori valu even valu concept classic polit economi physiolog concept labor decad later physic concept energi expenditur ident relat variant histor posit concept labor valu
TEXT:  By contrast, the Marxian critique of fetishism involves a value concept that is diametrically opposed to the positive labor theory of value.

TEXT:  To the extent that Marx reverts to the standpoint of a positive labor theory of value, his position fits into the theoretical debates of his time; on the other hand, his fetishism-analytical value concept, such as forms the basis, above all, for the presentation in Capital, represents an erratic block in the scientific landscape—and it does so up to today., NR: 1524, Book ID: Society After Money Dialogue, Processed Text: extent standpoint posit labor theori valu posit fit theoret debat time hand fetish analyt valu concept form basi present capit errat block scientif landscap doe today

TEXT: ” The value-critical approach that I advocate does not even try to bridge over this contradiction, in order to salvage the unity of Marxian theory. Instead, it abides by the following paradigm. A Marxism that adheres to a positive, naturalizing labor theory of value, participates in the basic errors of classical political economy and its heir, mainstream economics, and is, in the last analysis, condemned to run into the same dead-ends as the latter., NR: 1527, Book ID: Society After Money Dialogue, Processed Text: valu critic approach advoc doe even tri bridg contradict order salvag uniti theori instead follow paradigm posit labor theori valu basic error classic polit economi heir econom last analysi condemn run dead end latter
TEXT:  In the Marxian critique of fetishism, on the other hand, is to be found the key to the solution of the economic riddles that have brought about the failure of the dominant economic theory. Only on the basis of a concept of value that is consistently oriented to the critique of fetishism, and hence has been freed from the eggshells of a positive, naturalizing conception of labor value, is it possible further to develop the critique of political economy and to make it useful for the analysis of contemporary capitalism? Understood in this way, the theorem of the “two Marxes” has far-reaching implications for the question Hanno has raised concerning the theoretical status of the Marxian value concept., NR: 1528, Book ID: Society After Money Dialogue, Processed Text: critiqu fetish hand found key solut econom riddl brought failur domin econom theori basi concept valu consist critiqu fetish henc ha freed eggshel posit concept labor valu possibl develop critiqu polit economi make use analysi contemporari capit understood way theorem two ha far reach implic question ha rais concern theoret statu valu concept

TEXT: ” As concerns the Marx who is pulled along in the wake of the positive labor theory of value, this assessment is surely justified.

TEXT: ” Reformulated in terms of the critique of fetishism, the Marxian concept of value does not only substantively represent an erratic block in the scientific landscape, it is also methodologically conceived in a way for which it is difficult to find parallels in the categorial understanding of the scientific enterprise., NR: 1531, Book ID: Society After Money Dialogue, Processed Text: term critiqu fetish concept valu doe substant repres errat block scientif landscap also way difficult find parallel categori understand scientif enterpris
TEXT:  Massive problems of compatibility arise, above all, from a peculiarity of Marxian category formation.

TEXT:  The theorist tries to apply thought abstractions that are as appropriate as possible to the complex reality, such as to provide order to the latter in his or her mind. As against this, the Marxian critique of fetishism grasps value as, above all, a process of abstraction that takes place within the social reality., NR: 1533, Book ID: Society After Money Dialogue, Processed Text: theorist tri appli thought abstract appropri possibl complex realiti provid order latter mind critiqu fetish grasp valu process abstract take place within social realiti
TEXT:  In capitalism, society is subjected to an abstract social form of relationship, and the category of value allows us logically to grasp this subjection. In the usual understanding of science, abstraction processes take place exclusively in the human brain., NR: 1534, Book ID: Society After Money Dialogue, Processed Text: capit societi subject abstract social form relationship categori valu logic grasp subject usual understand scienc abstract process take place exclus human brain
TEXT:  Abstract categories are merely an instrument with the help of which the theorist explains reality. By contrast, the critique of fetishism sees an objective process of abstraction at work, which structures capitalist reality, and it interprets value as real abstraction., NR: 1535, Book ID: Society After Money Dialogue, Processed Text: abstract categori mere instrument help theorist realiti contrast critiqu fetish see object process abstract work structur capitalist realiti valu real abstract
TEXT:  The intellectual accomplishment of the theorist consists in deciphering this real process of abstraction. As is well known, Marx did not claim to be opposing a new political economy to classical political economy, but rather to be formulating a critique of political economy., NR: 1536, Book ID: Society After Money Dialogue, Processed Text: intellectu accomplish theorist real process abstract well known claim oppos new polit economi classic polit economi rather critiqu polit economi
TEXT:  This self-understanding points directly to the peculiar logical status of categories, such as that of value in the critique of fetishism. Marx by no means discards traditional value theories, in order to replace them with a new, positive value theory; rather, “value” as object of knowledge is simultaneously itself the object of criticism., NR: 1537, Book ID: Society After Money Dialogue, Processed Text: self understand point directli peculiar logic statu categori valu critiqu fetish mean discard tradit valu theori order replac new posit valu theori rather valu object knowledg simultan object critic
TEXT:  For Marx, value is not a neutral-analytical concept, but rather itself, as real abstraction, a crazy reality, which can only be theoretically penetrated from a negating standpoint. The little word “critique” means here something more than taking an ethically motivated decision against the prevailing form of socialization; it refers to the inner contradictoriness and, in the final analysis, untenability of value as real category., NR: 1538, Book ID: Society After Money Dialogue, Processed Text: valu neutral analyt concept rather real abstract crazi realiti theoret standpoint littl word critiqu mean someth take ethic decis form social inner final analysi unten valu real categori
TEXT:  This leads, however, to a second fundamental feature of the value concept, per the fetishism critique, that makes it stand out from the crowd of value theories: Value is also a category sui generis as a result of its thoroughly historical character., NR: 1539, Book ID: Society After Money Dialogue, Processed Text: lead howev second fundament featur valu concept per fetish critiqu make stand crowd valu theori valu also categori result thoroughli histor charact
TEXT:  As a rule, the usual value theories have value emerging from the social division of labor per se and, consequently, treat it as a category that is suitable for every sort of economy based on the division of labor., NR: 1540, Book ID: Society After Money Dialogue, Processed Text: rule usual valu theori valu social divis labor per consequ treat categori suitabl everi sort economi base divis labor
TEXT:  Marx, by contrast, emphasized that commodities only represent value as the form of presentation of separate acts of private labor. With its tendency to apotheosize labor, traditional Marxism has, as a rule, interpreted these remarks as if Marx’s point were to celebrate labor as the only source of social wealth and hence too of value., NR: 1541, Book ID: Society After Money Dialogue, Processed Text: contrast commod repres valu form present separ act privat labor tendenc apotheos labor tradit ha rule remark point celebr labor sourc social wealth henc valu
TEXT:  In so doing, Marxism has reproduced the usual conception of value as a trans-historical category. But the Marx of the critique of fetishism is thus erased and the main point of his argumentation is stood on its head., NR: 1542, Book ID: Society After Money Dialogue, Processed Text: ha usual concept valu histor categori critiqu fetish thu eras main point argument stood head
TEXT:  By deriving the constitution of value from private labor, Marx tied the formation of value to a specific social form of productive activity that first emerged along with capitalism. If the foundation of value, viz., NR: 1543, Book ID: Society After Money Dialogue, Processed Text: constitut valu privat labor tie format valu specif social form product activ first along capit foundat valu
TEXT:  the dissolution of society into separate private producers, is to be grasped as a historically specific phenomenon, then it follows that this is also the case for the category of value itself. Value is thus, in the first place, something deeply historical, as the category is to be reserved for the capitalist mode of production., NR: 1544, Book ID: Society After Money Dialogue, Processed Text: dissolut societi separ privat produc histor specif phenomenon also case categori valu valu thu first place someth deepli histor categori reserv capitalist mode product
TEXT:  Its historicity, however, also has a second dimension, which is at least as important for our questions, if not more so.

TEXT:  Whereas the value concept has a static character in other value theories, the critique of political economy grasps value as a dynamic category, inasmuch as its relation to material wealth evolves in a very particular direction., NR: 1546, Book ID: Society After Money Dialogue, Processed Text: wherea valu concept ha static charact valu theori critiqu polit economi grasp valu dynam categori inasmuch relat materi wealth particular direct
TEXT:  On the basis of the capitalist mode of production, whether and to what extent material production can be represented as value is subject to a particular historical trend of development. This concerns, in the first place, the level of individual commodities: As a result of the development of productivity, the labor-time necessary for the production of every individual commodity is constantly falling in all existing branches of social production., NR: 1547, Book ID: Society After Money Dialogue, Processed Text: basi capitalist mode product whether extent materi product valu subject particular histor trend develop concern first place level individu commod result develop product labor time necessari product everi individu commod constantli fall branch social product

TEXT:  But a clear tendency is also observable on the level of society as a whole. The increasing socialization of material production alters the composition of the aggregate social labor to the detriment of separate private labor and thus ultimately undermines the transformation of material wealth into value-wealth., NR: 1549, Book ID: Society After Money Dialogue, Processed Text: clear tendenc also observ level societi whole increas social materi product composit aggreg social labor detriment separ privat labor thu ultim transform materi wealth valu wealth
TEXT:  As sketched out by Marx in the “Fragment on Machines” in the Grundrisse, this process reaches a critical threshold when the application of science replaces isolated individual labor as the main force of production., NR: 1550, Book ID: Society After Money Dialogue, Processed Text: fragment machin process reach critic threshold applic scienc isol individu labor main forc product
TEXT:  Precisely as concerns the historicity of the value category, the presentation in the Grundrisse can certainly also serve as proof of the existence of “two Marxes.” On the one hand, the founder of the critique of political economy here thematizes the internal history of value particularly clearly and shows that the increasingly scientific character of production can ultimately only lead to one thing: “With that, production based on exchange value breaks down” (Marx 1973: 705)., NR: 1551, Book ID: Society After Money Dialogue, Processed Text: precis concern histor valu categori present certainli also serv proof exist two one hand founder critiqu polit economi intern histori valu particularli clearli show increasingli scientif charact product ultim lead one thing product base exchang valu break
TEXT:  On the other hand, in his treatment of the prehistory of capitalism, Marx reverts to the usual standpoint of other value theories and ascribes something like a pre-capitalist existence to value. Hanno’s reflections on a “higher-level or general theory of socio-cultural development” have also to be seen on this background., NR: 1552, Book ID: Society After Money Dialogue, Processed Text: hand treatment prehistori capit usual standpoint valu theori someth like capitalist exist valu reflect higher level gener theori cultur develop also seen background
TEXT:  Hanno refers to the changes in the orientation of Marx’s critical economic writings, and he writes: “Originally, Marx had in mind the elaboration of a general theory of socio-cultural development (the ‘materialist conception of history’), in order then, on the basis of it, to elaborate a specific theory of the capitalist economy as the presumed center of modern society., NR: 1553, Book ID: Society After Money Dialogue, Processed Text: chang orient critic econom write origin mind elabor gener theori cultur develop materialist concept histori order basi elabor specif theori capitalist economi center modern societi

TEXT: ” There was, however, a good reason for the shift away from the original plan and the narrow focus on the capitalist mode of production. Since, while working on Capital, Marx recognized value as a category that is proper only to the capitalist mode of production, he would have had to have founded a new type of general theory of socio-cultural development: a general theory that is not based on mystifying value as a trans-historical category., NR: 1555, Book ID: Society After Money Dialogue, Processed Text: wa howev good reason shift away origin plan narrow focu capitalist mode product sinc work capit valu categori proper capitalist mode product would new type gener theori cultur develop gener theori base valu histor categori
TEXT:  As little as there is to be said, in principle, against the desire to have a higher-level theory of socio-cultural development, it should not result in an elimination of Marx’s critique of fetishism.

TEXT:  Hanno Pahl It is not easy to provide a concise summary of our trialogue.

TEXT:  But the difficulties with which one could be confronted in doing so will also have been made plain. Ernst rightly notes that Marxian value theory represents an “erratic block in the scientific landscape” and that its methodological peculiarities give rise to “massive compatibility problems” in all attempts to bring it into relation with other, newer theoretical formats., NR: 1558, Book ID: Society After Money Dialogue, Processed Text: difficulti one could also made plain rightli note valu theori errat block scientif landscap methodolog peculiar give rise massiv compat problem attempt bring relat theoret format

TEXT:  With regard to our initial question on “money as medium or as commodity (set apart from the rest)?,” Jens’s inputs, in particular, have identified some possibilities. We can perhaps bring together these intentions into the fundamental question of whether we can go beyond the “semantics of mediation” deployed by Marx, in order to present the insights that it contains differently and, perhaps, more precisely (and to encourage debate about them)., NR: 1561, Book ID: Society After Money Dialogue, Processed Text: regard initi question money medium commod set apart rest input particular possibl perhap bring togeth intent fundament question whether beyond semant mediat order present insight differ perhap precis encourag debat

TEXT:  1Let us abstract here from the question concerning the relation between value and price, which leads directly into the depths of the so-called transformation problem. 2But Ernst also alludes to the fact that in the Grundrisse, Marx indeed writes explicitly that the “commodity achieves a double existence, not only a natural but also a purely economic existence, in which latter it is a mere symbol, a cipher for a relation of production, a mere symbol for its own value” (Marx 1973: 141)., NR: 1585, Book ID: Society After Money Dialogue, Processed Text: let abstract question concern relat valu price lead directli depth transform problem also fact inde explicitli commod doubl exist natur also pure econom exist latter mere symbol cipher relat product mere symbol valu

TEXT:  Money facilitates direct exchange of two goods as a measure of value for both goods and enables the involved parties to store value over time. Today’s mainstream economists explain the emergence of money in the same vein, implying that money increased the efficiency of markets, is as such neutral, and does not affect production, circulation or consumption of economic values (compare Graeber 2011, Brodbeck 2012 or Wäckerle 2013)., NR: 1627, Book ID: Society After Money Dialogue, Processed Text: money direct exchang two good measur valu good involv parti store valu time today economist explain emerg money vein money effici market neutral doe affect product circul consumpt econom valu compar

TEXT:  Monies in these theories thus address and (re)route debt between agents put in place by powerful actors more or less legitimately. Finally, monies have also been used to compensate for losses, as for example in the case of Wodani people, where a clan receives monies when it loses a member due to murder or marriage (Breton 1999, 2000 and Cartelier 2006); or today in the case of a fine that expresses responsibility and recognizes debt in the case, for example, environmental damage (Kallis et al., NR: 1632, Book ID: Society After Money Dialogue, Processed Text: theori thu address rout debt agent put place power actor less legitim final also use compens loss exampl case peopl clan member due murder marriag today case fine express respons debt case exampl environment damag

TEXT:  In an act of purchase, both parties assume money as a means of measurement. Hence money is one of the two exchanged commodities, and create equivalence or commensurability between the two goods. Repeated acts of purchase finally establish money in a society, as money is “reproduced through being again and again reciprocally recognized by the involved parties who use it” (Brodbeck 2012: 363)., NR: 1635, Book ID: Society After Money Dialogue, Processed Text: act purchas parti assum money mean measur henc money one two commod creat equival two good repeat act purchas final establish money societi money reciproc involv parti use

As Brenner and Glick (1991: 59) note: How else are we to understand Marx’s analysis of “Machinofacture” in Capital (published in 1867), which theorizes already-accomplished (though necessarily incomplete) processes of destruction of handicraft labor, subordination of workers to machines, and intensification of labor that were the consequence of the introduction of cost-cutting machinery and were every bit as spectacular as—and in many respects quite analogous to—the processes that occurred under the impetus of Taylorism-Fordism?

TEXT:  Bratton (2015: 260–265) argues that we are currently dealing with two types for both non-human and human users: the “overindividuated” user and the “hive user.” Both are products of economic imperialism where atomized individualization and homogeneity is a core axiom., NR: 1733, Book ID: Society After Money Dialogue, Processed Text: current deal two type non human human user user hive user product econom imperi homogen core axiom

TEXT:  The decisive question put forward by Bratton (2015: 263) is: “What kind of User can be designed instead?” The rather simple answer relates to “subtraction” and “design by absence.” Bratton (2015: 263) argues that the modern user lost its agency due to overdetermination of the self and the only meaningful reply to this black hole of self-quantification is “removal as design strategy., NR: 1736, Book ID: Society After Money Dialogue, Processed Text: decis question put forward kind user design instead rather simpl answer subtract design absenc modern user lost agenc due self meaning repli black hole self quantif remov design strategi
TEXT: ” In particular the author suggests to focus on a “plurality of users” instead of “one single user” or “one singular mass/hive of users.” Bratton (2015) is right in this regard, because step-wise removal will reveal real qualitative multiplicities of individual subjects/objects and will thereby show the heterogeneity and diversity of users in contrast to its simplified homogeneity of quantified multiplicities., NR: 1737, Book ID: Society After Money Dialogue, Processed Text: particular author focu plural user instead one singl user one singular mass hive user right regard step wise remov reveal real qualit multipl individu subject object therebi show heterogen divers user contrast simplifi homogen multipl

TEXT:  Since ownership and control of capital-money (…) is crucial to maintaining populations bonded to the current power relation, how can we turn financial money into the money of the common?

TEXT:  What kind of relationship can be established between the algorithms of money-creation and “a constituent practice which affirms other criteria for the measurement of wealth, valorizing new and old collective needs outside the logic of finance”? Terranova 2014: 391 We think that Terranova (2014) is addressing the right questions in this matter, by shifting the attention to the modalities of money as a symbolic carrier system of social values, and highlighting the potential of money as a common and not a capital good., NR: 1754, Book ID: Society After Money Dialogue, Processed Text: kind relationship establish algorithm money creation constitu practic criterion measur wealth new old collect need outsid logic financ think right question matter shift attent modal money symbol carrier system social valu potenti money common capit good

TEXT:  With regard to the latter, Bitcoin founders and advocates praise Bitcoin for properties that have been used to uphold the Gold Standard about 100 years ago. Arguments that resemble a form of “digital metallism” are not only found in the language used to describe Bitcoin (Bitcoins are “mined” like gold), but also the regulatory framing of the algorithm, which curbs the mining of Bitcoins and limits them to in total 21 million (see e., NR: 1757, Book ID: Society After Money Dialogue, Processed Text: regard latter founder advoc prais properti use uphold gold standard year ago argument resembl form digit metal found languag use describ like gold also regulatori frame algorithm curb mine limit total million see

TEXT:  Since the system relies on a decentralized validation, when more than 50 percent of the miners agree to betray the system, the validity of the system fails.

TEXT:  Jappe 2011 For most of us, there appears to be no alternative to economic activity with money. The land of milk and honey is a fairytale. But perhaps there is something more serious to be found in fantasy or utopian novels, or in works of science fiction? Money is a scarce commodity in such works, not because money has been abolished in all these fictional visions of the future, but because the subject of money hardly features at all., NR: 1823, Book ID: Society After Money Dialogue, Processed Text: altern econom activ money land milk honey perhap someth seriou found fantasi utopian novel work scienc fiction money scarc commod work money ha fiction vision futur subject money hardli featur

TEXT:  If this does occur it is most often in texts that construct an ideal city or state.

TEXT: ). In science fiction, in contrast, the “future world is shown via the plot” (ibid.: 11), and there is no coherent depiction of the economic foundation.

TEXT:  Utopias, on the other hand, are mainly concerned with human relationships, to which science and technology are subordinated.

TEXT:  In his text The Laws (around 345 BC), Plato (428/427–348/347 BC) argued that, because of the need for stability, money must only be used “for purposes of … daily exchange,” but that there should also be a law “which forbids any private person to possess any gold or silver” (Plato, Laws: 371)., NR: 1836, Book ID: Society After Money Dialogue, Processed Text: text law around need stabil money must use purpos daili exchang also law privat person possess gold silver law

Visions of the Future in the Industrial Society Still traveling hopefully toward the revolution, August Bebel (1840–1913) gave concrete form to ideas of a socialist future after the revolution in his 1872 text Die Frau und der Sozialismus (Woman and Socialism)., NR: 1849, Book ID: Society After Money Dialogue, Processed Text: vision futur industri societi still travel hope toward revolut august gave concret form idea socialist futur revolut text die woman social

TEXT: … Any kind of certificate, a printed piece of paper, gold or tin, enables the holder to exchange same for various kinds of commodities” (Bebel [1872] 1910: 398). These labor certificates are not money, because “We should like to know how a member of socialistic society could ‘hoard’ his gold working certificate or could even loan it on interest, when all the others also own what the one offers and—on which he lives” (ibid., NR: 1852, Book ID: Society After Money Dialogue, Processed Text: kind certif print piec paper gold tin holder exchang variou kind commod labor certif money like know member socialist societi could hoard gold work certif could even loan interest also one offer life ibid

In his two utopian books, Red Star (1907) and Engineer Menni (1912), he outlined, among other things, a mechanism for the organization of labor: “a self-organizing supersystem without that fatal wasting of energy which was an unavoidable consequence of all lower stages of development” (Rollberg 1988: 294)., NR: 1856, Book ID: Society After Money Dialogue, Processed Text: also made extrem import contribut futur social two utopian book red star engin outlin among thing mechan organ labor self supersystem without fatal wast energi wa unavoid consequ lower stage develop

TEXT:  The well-known early modern utopias of More and Campanella sought to establish the basis for a stable state, because of the historical upheavals the authors had experienced. In the course of the sixteenth century, the individual was “increasingly seen as driven by destructive passions” (Sonntag 1999: 103) and thus as disruptive to the desired order., NR: 1947, Book ID: Society After Money Dialogue, Processed Text: well known earli modern utopia sought establish basi stabl state histor upheav author experienc cours sixteenth centuri individu wa increasingli seen driven destruct passion thu disrupt desir order
TEXT:  This explains why the utopias of More and Campanella try to ensure that humans are regarded as essentially the same, and that this is reflected, for example, in their clothing. Rigid, stabilizing structures of order do not allow any of the emancipatory individuality we expect today, and so we can no longer identify with these utopias., NR: 1948, Book ID: Society After Money Dialogue, Processed Text: utopia tri ensur human essenti reflect exampl cloth rigid structur order allow emancipatori individu expect today longer identifi utopia
TEXT:  But there was one small exception even then. In Gargantua by François Rabelais (1494–1553), the Abbey of Thélème is depicted. The people described here, “who are free, well bred, and conversant with honorable company, have by nature an instinct—a goad—which always pricks then towards virtuous acts and withdraws them from vice., NR: 1949, Book ID: Society After Money Dialogue, Processed Text: wa one small except even abbey peopl free well bred convers honor compani natur instinct goad alway prick toward virtuou act vice
TEXT:  They called it Honour” (Rabelais [1542] 2006: 373). The rule governing this elite order is “Do what thou wilt” (ibid.), and it goes without saying that money is not needed. Many other utopias stipulate that people must be educated in such a way that they can live sensibly in this utopia., NR: 1950, Book ID: Society After Money Dialogue, Processed Text: rule govern elit order thou wilt ibid go without say money mani utopia stipul peopl must educ way live sensibl utopia
TEXT:  At the same time the notion is considered, e.g. by Robert Owen, that upbringing, education, and circumstances determine human behavior, and that the latter must therefore be arranged accordingly. In Huxley’s Island, the culture is based on Buddhist-influenced practices and ideas, and the people follow a “road that leads towards happiness from the inside out, through health, through awareness, through a change in one’s attitude towards the world; not towards the mirage of happiness from the outside in, through toys and pills and non-stop distractions” (Huxley [1962] 2005: 207)., NR: 1951, Book ID: Society After Money Dialogue, Processed Text: time notion consid educ circumst determin human behavior latter must therefor accordingli island cultur base practic idea peopl follow road lead toward happi insid health awar chang one attitud toward world toward mirag happi outsid toy pill non stop distract

TEXT:  There is never any shortage of voluntary labor—work is a natural need for the mature members of our society, and all overt or disguised compulsion is quite superfluous’ ” (Bogdanov [1912] 1984: 66). A similar argument is found in del Antonio’s novel: “Anyone who does nothing is ill … There is no such thing as a healthy person who does not engage in any activity., NR: 1956, Book ID: Society After Money Dialogue, Processed Text: never shortag voluntari labor work natur need matur member societi overt disguis compuls quit superflu similar argument found novel anyon doe noth ill thing healthi person doe engag activ

TEXT:  The father is still characterized by isolation and coldness (Bogdanov [1912] 1984: 193)—it is only in the son that the personality can develop in the person (ibid.: 205). This leads to the emergence of a “qualitatively new type of interpersonal relationship—“cooperative collaboration”—, [which] is characterized by the generation of rational norms, by individual freedom, personal responsibility, equal rights, and discursive, collective problem-solving” (Soboleva 2008: 4)., NR: 1959, Book ID: Society After Money Dialogue, Processed Text: father still isol cold son person develop person ibid lead emerg qualit new type interperson relationship collabor gener ration norm individu freedom person respons equal right discurs collect problem
TEXT:  Of course human relationships will not be conflict-free even with other structures of ownership, as emphasized by Kim Stanley Robinson in the anthology of short stories Martians (1999). He writes: “people are still people; argue, resent, hate, are selfish, will share only with kin or those they know, if that is what you mean by ‘human nature’; but are now in an economic framework where they are roughly equal to those they despise, and cannot grossly oppress or be oppressed by them, financially” (Robinson 1999: 201)., NR: 1960, Book ID: Society After Money Dialogue, Processed Text: cours human relationship conflict free even structur ownership kim antholog short stori peopl still peopl argu resent hate selfish share kin know mean human natur econom framework roughli equal despis cannot grossli oppress oppress financi

TEXT:  But in the novel Accelerando, by Charles Stross, the algorithms are already “superior,” and the term 2.0 in “Economics 2.0” stands for the fact that humans can no longer understand it (Stross 2005: ch., NR: 1963, Book ID: Society After Money Dialogue, Processed Text: novel accelerando algorithm alreadi superior term econom stand fact human longer understand
TEXT:  8), that is, humans are “just barely intelligent tool users .… sadly deficient in smarts” (ibid.: ch. 7). Not Everything Is Better Without Money If it is not possible to develop a higher form of society, then dispensing with money can also have disadvantages, as Marx already knew: “Strike out money, and one would thereby either be thrown back to a lower stage of production (corresponding to that of auxiliary barter), or one would proceed to a higher stage, in which exchange value would no longer be the principal aspect of the commodity, because social labor, whose representative it is, would no longer appear merely as socially mediated private labor” (Marx [1939] 1973: 214)., NR: 1964, Book ID: Society After Money Dialogue, Processed Text: human bare intellig tool user sadli defici smart ibid everyth better without money possibl develop higher form societi money also disadvantag alreadi knew strike money one would therebi either thrown back lower stage product correspond auxiliari barter one would proceed higher stage exchang valu would longer princip aspect commod social labor whose repres would longer appear mere social privat labor
TEXT:  This situation is depicted in Reinmar Cunis’s (1933–1989) novel Wenn der Krebsbaum blüht [When the Crabtree Blooms, 1987]. After substantial refugee and migration movements caused by global environmental disasters, new communities come together, in which a few “independent small feudal systems” (Cunis 1987: 443) develop, whose economic dealings with each other are once again based on contributions in kind., NR: 1965, Book ID: Society After Money Dialogue, Processed Text: situat novel bloom substanti refuge migrat movement global environment disast new commun come togeth independ small feudal system develop whose econom deal base contribut kind
TEXT:  In other utopias without money, social control is used to regulate work and consumption, as in the story of “Idle Jack” in Russell’s “And Then There Were None.” So if new social structures of mediation are to replace the mediating function of money, they must on the one hand be able to deal with restrictions on the available goods, possibly arising for ecological reasons, and on the other hand avoid surrendering the regulation of highly complex and global process chains to new fetish-like structures in the form of digital algorithms., NR: 1966, Book ID: Society After Money Dialogue, Processed Text: utopia without money social control use regul work consumpt stori idl jack none new social structur mediat replac mediat function money must one hand abl deal restrict avail good possibl ecolog reason hand avoid regul highli complex global process chain new fetish like structur form digit algorithm

TEXT:  Only Ernest Callenbach and Ursula le Guin raised the possibility of limiting the volume of production for ecological reasons. Since the turn of the millennium, two trends have been clearly moving apart: on the one hand texts developing alternative utopias based on political movements, texts that seek to persuade more by arguments than by entertainment, and on the other hand action-packed science fiction novels which increasingly also touch on economic themes., NR: 1971, Book ID: Society After Money Dialogue, Processed Text: rais possibl limit volum product ecolog reason sinc turn millennium two trend clearli move apart one hand text altern utopia base polit movement text seek persuad argument entertain hand action scienc fiction novel increasingli also touch econom theme

TEXT:  The reason why money or forms of mediation similar to money are still accepted in many utopias is undoubtedly that not all money is seen as serving to oppress other people. Marx also distinguished between a mere “monetary function” and money as capital, based on the class relations between the owners of the means of production and the doubly free proletarians: “But money appears very early on as a buyer of so-called services, without its being transformed into money capital, and without any revolution in the general character of the economy” (Marx [1867] 1978: 114)., NR: 1973, Book ID: Society After Money Dialogue, Processed Text: reason money form mediat similar money still accept mani utopia undoubtedli money seen serv oppress peopl also distinguish mere monetari function money capit base class relat owner mean product doubli free proletarian money earli buyer servic without money capit without revolut gener charact economi

TEXT:  If we are thinking about a “society after X,” then, the first thing we need to clarify is what exactly we mean by X, and the second is why and in what circumstances we expect X to disappear one day. To answer the concrete question of what might be meant by money, it is helpful to begin by consulting a standard reference work such as the Gabler Wirtschaftslexikon (2017): “Money is the generally recognized means of exchange and payment which a society has agreed on., NR: 2019, Book ID: Society After Money Dialogue, Processed Text: think societi first thing need clarifi exactli mean second circumst expect disappear one day answer concret question might meant money help begin consult standard refer work money gener mean exchang payment societi ha agre
TEXT: ” To my mind this definition is good enough to work with. It stipulates that any “generally recognized means of exchange and payment” is money.

TEXT:  The dictionary article quoted above does recognize money as a phenomenon of limited historical duration, but seems to posit exchange as more or less universal: The transition from the barter economy to the monetary economy began with what was initially a local custom: dividing the previously simultaneous exchange of two goods or services into separate processes of buying and selling by agreeing on an intermediary exchange good (Zwischentauschgut)., NR: 2023, Book ID: Society After Money Dialogue, Processed Text: dictionari articl doe recogn money phenomenon limit histor durat posit exchang less univers transit barter economi monetari economi wa initi local custom divid previous simultan exchang two good servic separ process sell agre intermediari exchang good

TEXT:  1.1 Money, Exchange and Markets in Subsistence-Oriented and Peasant Economies The economic anthropologist George Dalton—a student of Polanyi, who can hardly be suspected of an uncritical generalization of capitalist conditions—observes: “[E]very society … has an economy of some sort because personal and community life require the structured provision of material goods and services” (Dalton 1971: 25)., NR: 2027, Book ID: Society After Money Dialogue, Processed Text: money exchang market subsist peasant economi econom anthropologist dalton student hardli suspect uncrit gener capitalist condit societi ha economi sort person commun life requir structur provis materi good servic dalton
TEXT:  This process is never left to chance, because if it worked too poorly (or did not work at all) this could soon lead to hardship and death (ibid. 31). In this sense, then, it makes sense to speak of an “economy” even in relation to pre-capitalist or non-capitalist societies, referring to this structured process of provision for present and future needs., NR: 2028, Book ID: Society After Money Dialogue, Processed Text: process never left chanc work poorli work could soon lead hardship death ibid sens make sens speak economi even relat capitalist non capitalist societi structur process provis present futur need
TEXT:  The process exists in every society, but it is only in capitalism that it takes the particular form of a multitude of private, competing firms, aiming to maximize their profits. Dalton (1971: 31f.) also notes that not all but most economies have external trade, markets, certain forms of money, and some kind of accounting devices—so much for the idea of money as a specifically capitalist phenomenon., NR: 2029, Book ID: Society After Money Dialogue, Processed Text: process everi societi capit take particular form multitud privat firm aim maxim profit dalton also note economi extern trade market certain form money kind account devic much idea money specif capitalist phenomenon

TEXT:  While there are clear differences between different modes of production, these are more subtle than we might think. One difference is that in subsistence-oriented economies external trade is only used for the import of goods that are not available locally, while in the capitalist global economy it is based on the principle of cost minimization (the least-cost principle; Dalton 1971: 58)., NR: 2032, Book ID: Society After Money Dialogue, Processed Text: clear differ differ mode product subtl might think one differ subsist economi extern trade use import good avail local capitalist global economi base principl cost minim least cost principl dalton

TEXT:  Most people are not dependent on successful market transactions to secure their livelihood; instead this is ensured by subsistence production in the framework of small groups (ibid.). In capitalism, individuals, households and firms are faced with innumerable choices: which of the countless goods they should buy, what occupation they should specialize in, what kinds of goods they should produce, and what technologies they should use to do so., NR: 2034, Book ID: Society After Money Dialogue, Processed Text: peopl depend success market transact secur livelihood instead subsist product framework small group ibid capit individu household firm face innumer choic countless good buy occup special kind good produc technolog use
TEXT:  Many of these choices take the form of monetary calculations, or these at least play a certain part (Dalton 1971: 78). In subsistence economies, on the other hand, the choices are much more limited—because people mainly produce for their own use, and because the existing ecological and technological conditions, with a low level of technological development, often present few options., NR: 2035, Book ID: Society After Money Dialogue, Processed Text: mani choic take form monetari calcul least play certain part dalton subsist economi hand choic much limit peopl mainli produc use ecolog technolog condit low level technolog develop often present option
TEXT:  But even if alternatives are imaginable, they are usually not explored, because there are precise conventions about what is customary, from which individuals do not deviate.

TEXT:  Most families work their own land and make many of their tools themselves; wage labor exists, but most people are not wage laborers.

TEXT:  This land can be lent but not sold; if the household gives it up, it reverts to the community. The right to the labor of others is not usually gained by employing wage laborers, but by way of kinship (family members join in the work) and reciprocity (for big projects, all the families work together; Dalton 1971: 127f., NR: 2045, Book ID: Society After Money Dialogue, Processed Text: land lent sold household give commun right labor usual wage labor way kinship famili member join work reciproc big project famili work togeth dalton
TEXT: ). Traditionally, markets were only of secondary importance in Africa; the majority of production was organized by means of reciprocity and redistribution (Dalton 1971: 134). This distinction between different principles of production has its origins in the work of the economic historian Karl Polanyi ([1944] 2001), who differentiates between market exchange, redistribution, and reciprocity., NR: 2046, Book ID: Society After Money Dialogue, Processed Text: tradit market secondari import major product wa organ mean reciproc redistribut dalton distinct differ principl product ha origin work econom historian market exchang redistribut reciproc
TEXT:  Redistribution means that a central political authority demands certain contributions, and then distributes the resources gathered in this way in accordance with political decisions.

TEXT:  Here reciprocity must not be confused with “voluntariness”; instead it is based on clear social rules (Dalton 1971: 27, 53). Even today, if someone has given us a birthday present, it is difficult to imagine going to their next birthday party empty-handed, or if someone has helped us move to a new house we cannot refuse to help with their next move, unless there is a good reason., NR: 2049, Book ID: Society After Money Dialogue, Processed Text: reciproc must confus voluntari instead base clear social rule dalton even today someon ha given birthday present difficult imagin go next birthday parti empti hand someon ha move new hous cannot refus help next move unless good reason
TEXT:  As there were markets for certain products in many societies, without market exchange being the socially dominant principle, Dalton (1971: 144) distinguishes between market places on the one hand, and the market principle or market mechanism on the other., NR: 2050, Book ID: Society After Money Dialogue, Processed Text: market certain product mani societi without market exchang social domin principl dalton market place one hand market principl market mechan

TEXT:  While a weekly market is a specific place, the “labor market” is a social institution.

TEXT:  In general the vassal had a lifelong right to farm the land, as long as he paid the contributions demanded, and he could hand this right down, but not sell it.

TEXT:  Occasionally day laborers were hired, but this tended to be the exception (ibid.: 226f.). Nonetheless, market places can be very important for buyers even in societies where the market principle plays only a secondary role, because there are some goods they can only acquire on the market (Dalton 1971: 150)., NR: 2055, Book ID: Society After Money Dialogue, Processed Text: occasion day labor hire except ibid nonetheless market place import buyer even societi market principl play secondari role good acquir market dalton

TEXT:  A statement such as “anyone who wants to overcome capitalism (and its brutality) must also renounce money and markets” creates a false dilemma, and conflicts with the real diversity of possible means of production which can be imagined, or have appeared in the course of history., NR: 2072, Book ID: Society After Money Dialogue, Processed Text: statement anyon want overcom capit brutal must also renounc money market fals dilemma conflict real divers possibl mean product cours histori
TEXT:  Critiques of money-based economic activity are also often premised on the idea that things which were possible in the past could work again in the future. Thomas Herzig (2011) declares, for example: “For a start, the moneyless society is not a utopia., NR: 2073, Book ID: Society After Money Dialogue, Processed Text: critiqu money base econom activ also often idea thing possibl past could work futur exampl start moneyless societi utopia

TEXT:  For example, the population density used to be much lower. True, capitalism today is not able to provide “sustainably” for seven billion people: many lack the bare necessities, while at the same time the earth is being systematically overexploited., NR: 2075, Book ID: Society After Money Dialogue, Processed Text: exampl popul densiti use much lower true capit today abl provid seven billion peopl mani lack bare necess time earth systemat
TEXT:  But earlier societies, especially the hunter-gatherer cultures which were in fact money-free, needed many times more land per person than the amount that is now available. So a direct return to pre-capitalist modes of production is unthinkable, since the seven billion people are not simply going to disappear., NR: 2076, Book ID: Society After Money Dialogue, Processed Text: societi especi gather cultur fact money free mani time land per person amount avail direct return capitalist mode product unthink sinc seven billion peopl simpli go disappear
TEXT:  Another substantial difference is the vastly increased complexity emphasized by Dalton (1971).

TEXT:  On the other hand, it includes the highly differentiated division of labor, which has brought forth a multitude of different occupations. Today this complexity is mediated by money: everyone can decide for themselves what they will consume, but only as long as they are able to pay for it—money is the primary means of distribution., NR: 2078, Book ID: Society After Money Dialogue, Processed Text: hand highli divis labor ha brought forth multitud differ occup today complex money everyon decid consum long abl pay money primari mean distribut
TEXT:  At the same time, money plays an essential role in the production process: firms produce in order to make profits, that is, to turn money into more money, and people go to work in return for payment. Despite all the ideological glorification of work as something that gives meaning to life, most people are probably aware that they mainly work in order to earn money., NR: 2079, Book ID: Society After Money Dialogue, Processed Text: time money play essenti role product process firm produc order make profit turn money money peopl work return payment despit ideolog glorif work someth give mean life peopl probabl awar mainli work order earn money
TEXT:  In a money-free society, production and distribution would have to be organized in completely different ways. But how could this work, and what would be the consequences?

TEXT:  2. Distribution Without Money? Today the distribution of many goods works via money. If we want to acquire a good we pay the price set for it and gain access to it in return. Sometimes we acquire full property rights, including the right to sell on the good to others as we see fit, at a freely negotiable price; sometimes we only secure limited rights of use., NR: 2082, Book ID: Society After Money Dialogue, Processed Text: distribut without money today distribut mani good work via money want acquir good pay price set gain access return sometim acquir full properti right right sell good see fit freeli negoti price sometim secur limit right use
TEXT:  How could all this work without payment? One possibility is “taking what you need”; here there are two alternatives, depending on how “need” is defined. Does every person decide subjectively, as he or she sees fit, or is need defined by social institutions, according to objectively formulated criteria? In the latter case, this is distribution according to socially defined need., NR: 2083, Book ID: Society After Money Dialogue, Processed Text: could work without payment one possibl take need two altern depend need defin doe everi person decid subject see fit need defin social institut accord object criterion latter case distribut accord social defin need
TEXT:  Today, for example, statutory health insurance in Germany and other European states mainly works this way. Medically necessary treatment which has been prescribed by a doctor is paid for by the health insurance fund, and thus the cost is shared by all those insured; the person receiving the treatment pays little or nothing., NR: 2084, Book ID: Society After Money Dialogue, Processed Text: today exampl statutori health insur state mainli work way medic necessari treatment ha doctor health insur fund thu cost insur person treatment pay littl noth
TEXT:  If, instead, everyone can make their own subjective choices, then the prevailing principle is “help yourself” or “take what you want.” Today, for example, access to public parks and streets works in this way., NR: 2085, Book ID: Society After Money Dialogue, Processed Text: instead everyon make subject choic principl help take want today exampl access public park street work way
TEXT:  This model sounds ideal from a “communist” perspective, but has the obvious disadvantage that it only works if there is enough of the good in question to satisfy everyone’s need for it.

TEXT:  But regardless of the concrete mode of production, it should be clear that in the case of material goods and services it would probably not be possible to avoid a demand surplus at least in some cases (a demand surplus arises when the number of people wanting to use a particular good, made available at a price of zero, exceeds the quantity of the commodity that is available)., NR: 2087, Book ID: Society After Money Dialogue, Processed Text: regardless concret mode product clear case materi good servic would probabl possibl avoid demand surplu least case demand surplu number peopl want use particular good made avail price zero quantiti commod avail
TEXT:  The finite nature of the earth and its resources makes this a given.

TEXT:  Thus the “help yourself” principle appears to be the appropriate mode of distribution for information products, though admittedly this does not answer the question of how they are to be produced. But how can material goods and services be distributed if there is a demand surplus? One possible way to solve this is to leave it to the producers to decide who will have the available goods., NR: 2089, Book ID: Society After Money Dialogue, Processed Text: thu help principl appropri mode distribut inform product though admittedli doe answer question produc materi good servic distribut demand surplu one possibl way solv leav produc decid avail good

TEXT:  Another option would be for the producers to produce mainly for themselves, for their collective personal use. Only if something is left after this is it distributed to others. This would be a return to subsistence production., NR: 2091, Book ID: Society After Money Dialogue, Processed Text: anoth option would produc produc mainli collect person use someth left distribut would return subsist product

TEXT:  I therefore refer to it as “high-tech subsistence” (cf. Kratzwald 2014: 122). While in traditional subsistence production the main things produced were food, clothing and housing, high-tech subsistence production would also be able to produce many other goods, thanks to modern production methods such as 3D printing., NR: 2093, Book ID: Society After Money Dialogue, Processed Text: therefor refer high tech subsist tradit subsist product main thing produc food cloth hous high tech subsist product would also abl produc mani good thank modern product method print

TEXT:  Of course it is possible that such a scenario may come about (whether desired or not), if the highly networked and extremely complex capitalist mode of production experiences a catastrophic collapse, and small groups of “survivors” have no choice but to fall back on their own, local resources and skills., NR: 2095, Book ID: Society After Money Dialogue, Processed Text: cours possibl scenario may come whether desir highli extrem complex capitalist mode product experi catastroph collaps small group survivor choic fall back local resourc skill
TEXT:  Whether there would then still be computers and reliable sources of power, the essential prerequisites for high-tech solutions such as 3D printers, is doubtful: a “post-collapse society” (Heimrath 2012) would probably be forced to return to low-tech subsistence., NR: 2096, Book ID: Society After Money Dialogue, Processed Text: whether would still comput reliabl sourc power essenti prerequisit high tech solut printer doubt post collaps societi would probabl forc return low tech subsist
TEXT:  But even if high-tech subsistence were still an option, production in small groups—which can organize themselves spontaneously and without money—would probably leave much to be desired. And in the case of cooperation in large groups, the question that again arises is: “How does the division of tasks and goods function without money, compulsion, or excessive bureaucracy?”—a question that is still relatively easy to resolve in small-scale subsistence production., NR: 2097, Book ID: Society After Money Dialogue, Processed Text: even high tech subsist still option product small group organ spontan without money would probabl leav much desir case larg group question doe divis task good function without money compuls excess bureaucraci question still rel easi resolv small scale subsist product

TEXT:  When products are needed in greater quantities, industrial mass production is still the more efficient option. Thus the subsistence perspective, even in its high-tech version, seems set to remain a “second-choice” way of life: anyone who is still able to find a reasonably well-paid job in capitalism is likely to see the great range of cheaply manufactured mass-produced goods as more attractive., NR: 2101, Book ID: Society After Money Dialogue, Processed Text: product greater quantiti industri mass product still effici option thu subsist perspect even high tech version set remain second choic way life anyon still abl find reason well job capit like see great rang cheapli mass produc good attract

TEXT:  Which brings us back to the question of the “money-free” distribution of the remaining goods.

TEXT:  Just as a reminder, we are only talking about how a demand surplus is dealt with: those cases where somebody would end up empty-handed if everyone were simply to help themselves. Various “money-free” solutions to this problem could be found, for example: •First come, first served (FCFS): everyone can help themselves to all available products; but if the shelves are empty, you are out of luck., NR: 2108, Book ID: Society After Money Dialogue, Processed Text: remind talk demand surplu dealt case somebodi would end empti hand everyon simpli help variou money free solut problem could found exampl first come first everyon help avail product shelf empti luck
TEXT:  •Distribution by lot: anyone who wants to have a particular kind of product puts their name on a list; lots are then drawn to distribute the available goods among those on the list. •Rationing: for each scarce product category, those responsible determine exactly who is allowed to consume how much of it, so ideally no one ends up empty-handed., NR: 2109, Book ID: Society After Money Dialogue, Processed Text: distribut lot anyon want particular kind product put name list lot drawn distribut avail good among list scarc product categori respons determin exactli consum much ideal one end empti hand
TEXT:  Although all these methods are fundamentally fair, none of them is altogether convincing.

TEXT:  It is possible to increase one’s own chances by asking friends to apply for the desired good as well, and to pass it on if they win.

TEXT:  Furthermore, all three methods would probably lead to the emergence of a black market, via which people who have received one of the scarce commodities would sell it on to those who received nothing. Even if there is officially no money, a suitable reward or return gift would no doubt be found, leading to barter trade, or one of the scarce goods would take on the role of a black-market currency., NR: 2113, Book ID: Society After Money Dialogue, Processed Text: furthermor three method would probabl lead emerg black market via peopl receiv one scarc commod would sell receiv noth even offici money suitabl reward return gift would doubt found lead barter trade one scarc good would take role black market currenc

TEXT:  But as stated above, a universally affluent society is not a realistic prospect for the foreseeable future, at least as long as humanity remains on earth, with its finite resources. So perhaps a price system is not a bad idea, at least for some of the goods that are not available in abundance?

TEXT:  3. Moneyless Production I understand production in a broad sense, as in Dalton’s definition (1971: 25), encompassing the provision of necessary and desired activities and goods.

TEXT: 6 From a historical perspective, this mode of production was dominant in subsistence-oriented economies: subsistence production is production in fairly small groups for collective personal use, which can certainly be understood as production for (extended) personal use, since the group ensures that there are at least loose relationships between all of its members., NR: 2131, Book ID: Society After Money Dialogue, Processed Text: histor perspect mode product wa domin subsist economi subsist product product fairli small group collect person use certainli understood product extend person use sinc group least loos relationship member
TEXT:  3.1 The Dunbar Limit Of course this is the limitation of subsistence production, as mentioned above: since it is based on personal relationships, it mainly works on a small scale. I will refer to this as the “Dunbar limit,” after the “Dunbar number” identified by the anthropologist Robin Dunbar, which indicates the number of people with whom someone can maintain personal relationships., NR: 2132, Book ID: Society After Money Dialogue, Processed Text: limit cours limit subsist product sinc base person relationship mainli work small scale refer limit number anthropologist robin number peopl someon maintain person relationship

But of course these huge teams do not come out of nowhere: they consist of programmers who would probably, for the most part, not be sufficiently motivated to work on the software for many years voluntarily and without pay; the salary paid to them (which is ultimately funded by the users) provides the necessary motivation., NR: 2209, Book ID: Society After Money Dialogue, Processed Text: extent differ due fact proprietari compani huge develop team small team volunt cannot compet work cours huge team come nowher consist programm would probabl part suffici work mani year voluntarili without pay salari ultim fund user necessari motiv

TEXT:  4. Money and Explicitly Agreed Reciprocity Cannot Easily Be Rendered Superfluous Overall, it can be said that there are many arguments against money, and especially against its “autonomization” in capitalism, and the way it dominates all other relationships as a compulsion or drive to maximize profit., NR: 2214, Book ID: Society After Money Dialogue, Processed Text: money explicitli agre reciproc cannot easili superflu overal said mani argument money especi capit way relationship compuls drive maxim profit

TEXT:  Most notably, no systematic tendency towards profit maximization can be observed in places where there are markets but no market principle—where products are traded, but not land or labor. Moreover, the analysis shows that explicitly agreed reciprocity along the lines of “I give so that you may give/do” is an option for human interaction which can hardly be replaced completely and without losses by other options, at least in “large-scale” contexts that exceed the Dunbar limit., NR: 2216, Book ID: Society After Money Dialogue, Processed Text: notabl systemat tendenc toward profit maxim place market market principl product land labor moreov analysi show explicitli agre reciproc along line give may give option human interact hardli complet without loss option least larg scale context exceed limit

TEXT:  Money is an essential factor of social coherence, and the incipient global financial crises show what happens when the creation of coherence no longer works.

TEXT:  This task is much bigger than just finding a “substitute” for money as means of mediation—indeed, this view reproduces the predominant neoclassical economic theory’s assumption of the “neutrality of money” or of the “monetary veil” that lies over all real transactions (Romer 2012; cf., NR: 2236, Book ID: Society After Money Dialogue, Processed Text: task much bigger find substitut money mean mediat inde view predomin econom theori assumpt neutral money monetari veil lie real transact
TEXT:  also Lohoff in the present volume). In fact, what is at issue is an entirely new mode of reproduction,1 in which money can no longer have any societal function. Instead of dichotomously opposing “real” and “monetary” processes, like in the neoclassical economic paradigm, I start from the assumption of their identity: here in the sense of an identity that can comprehend the interrelationship of that which is different., NR: 2237, Book ID: Society After Money Dialogue, Processed Text: also present volum fact issu entir new mode reproduct money longer societ function instead dichotom oppos real monetari process like econom paradigm start assumpt ident sens ident comprehend differ
TEXT:  Accordingly, what has to be explained is why a social process of reproduction—the process for creating and maintaining all conditions of life—gets split into “real” and “monetary” processes at all and why its moments then also gain independence vis-à-vis one another, even though they are only what they are in their unity and can also only be grasped in this way., NR: 2238, Book ID: Society After Money Dialogue, Processed Text: accordingli ha social process reproduct process condit life get split real monetari process moment also gain independ one anoth even though uniti also way
TEXT:  It is only on this basis that we can first develop the question of whether and how it is possible to depict a total social system of reproduction that does not give rise to the dichotomization of the real, because social mediation takes place in a qualitatively different fashion., NR: 2239, Book ID: Society After Money Dialogue, Processed Text: basi first develop question whether possibl depict total social system reproduct doe give rise dichotom real social mediat take place qualit differ fashion

TEXT:  Thus, for instance, “communism” is this sort of image, which has been shaped by way of historical experiences with formerly really-existing socialism.

TEXT:  Thus, capitalism is undeniably a human society; but, with the monetary mediation that is proper to it, it does not necessarily represent an, as it were, “natural-ideal” form of social organization.

TEXT:  Mediation The concept of mediation has hitherto been used without explanation. We want now to provide a more precise definition, since the concept is key for the argument to follow.

TEXT:  It makes no difference who concretely makes these contributions; they have simply to be made by someone.

TEXT:  What appears from the point of view of society as transpersonal necessities, are for individuals merely (inter-)personal action possibilities.2 If purposes and modes of functioning are inscribed into the societal infrastructures and hence have objective character, then these purposes on the level of necessities can come into conflict with subjective needs on the level of possibilities., NR: 2253, Book ID: Society After Money Dialogue, Processed Text: point view societi transperson necess individu mere inter person action possibl purpos mode societ infrastructur henc object charact purpos level necess come conflict subject need level possibl

TEXT:  Even if the dual mediation depicted above could take place in a post-capitalist and hence a post-monetary society (which has still to be shown), the question remains whether social obligations—hence, non-monetary relations of debt—will, then, become obsolete or if they possess a supra-historical character and hence will look for other forms of expression., NR: 2257, Book ID: Society After Money Dialogue, Processed Text: even dual mediat could take place post capitalist henc post monetari societi ha still shown question remain whether social oblig henc non monetari relat debt becom obsolet possess histor charact henc look form express

TEXT: 4 The question for a post-monetary society is hence whether and for what domains (inter-individual, collective, societal) such unconditional reciprocity relations can be adopted.

TEXT:  This fact has now to be taken into account. Elementary Form: Commodity The dual mediation depicted above is also reflected in individual reproductive actions. These have to be doubly functional: hence, at the same time, to secure one’s own existence and to reproduce the systemic context in which the actions possess their functionality., NR: 2261, Book ID: Society After Money Dialogue, Processed Text: fact ha taken account elementari form commod dual mediat also reflect individu reproduct action doubli function henc time secur one exist reproduc system context action possess function

TEXT:  The commodity is thus the elementary form (cf. Marx 1976: 125) that generates the totality of the system of capitalism and, at the same time, is generated by the latter and only within it possesses the function of elementary form (cf., NR: 2263, Book ID: Society After Money Dialogue, Processed Text: commod thu elementari form total system capit time latter within function elementari form
TEXT:  footnote 3). On this understanding, the commodity is not a neutral thing, but rather a social form, in which special “things” and “services”—products for sale—are produced.

TEXT: 5 In all societies, production is—to a varying extent—production for general others. The particularity of capitalism is the production for others on the basis of private property. Private production by entities that are separate from one another requires after-the-fact (“ex post”) that there be exchange for the purpose of mediating between producers of goods and those who need them (and have the money to buy them)., NR: 2265, Book ID: Society After Money Dialogue, Processed Text: societi product extent product gener particular capit product basi privat properti privat product entiti separ one anoth fact post exchang purpos mediat produc good need money buy
TEXT:  The market is the generalized instance of this ex post mediation.6 The universality of market mediation leads, in turn, to a number of far-reaching consequences. Some of the aspects that are relevant to the context of the current presentation will be discussed here: duplication, equivalence, competition, inversion, valorization, externalization, and logic of exclusion., NR: 2266, Book ID: Society After Money Dialogue, Processed Text: market gener instanc post mediat univers market mediat lead turn number far reach consequ aspect relev context current present duplic equival competit invers valor extern logic exclus
TEXT:  Duplication The commodity “duplicates” itself, because its two moments of usefulness and mediation develop in opposition to one another.7 The commodity is physically useful for those who want to obtain it, in order to satisfy needs: in other words, for the buyer, but not for the seller., NR: 2267, Book ID: Society After Money Dialogue, Processed Text: duplic commod duplic two moment use mediat develop opposit one anoth commod physic use want obtain order satisfi need word buyer seller

TEXT: 8 A societal relation with all productive outlay is thereby formed. This relation is value.

TEXT:  In order to be quantitatively operational, value must be depicted in a fixed objective or symbolic entity. This entity exists in the form of money.

TEXT:  Colloquially expressed: The commodity has a price that has to be paid to obtain it—and, ultimately, to use it. Although the satisfaction of needs provides the original impetus for production, value has priority., NR: 2272, Book ID: Society After Money Dialogue, Processed Text: colloqui express commod ha price ha obtain ultim use although satisfact need origin impetu product valu ha prioriti
TEXT:  Equivalence The generality of value comparisons, cutting across all differences in individual acts of exchange, provides for equivalence. On average, consequently, equal values always exchange: hence equal societal production outlays., NR: 2273, Book ID: Society After Money Dialogue, Processed Text: equival gener valu comparison cut across differ individu act exchang equival averag consequ equal valu alway exchang henc equal societ product outlay
TEXT:  It is important here that usefulness is irrelevant for mediation. Only the property of representing value—as expressed in money—is taken into account for the mediation.

TEXT:  In the opposition between usefulness and mediation, mediation plays the determining role.

TEXT:  Since all producers (must) do this, but the market is limited, the social relationship into which private producers are forced is that of competition.9 Inversion Active producers can always freely decide about their production, but the standard by which their action has to be oriented is given: It is sellability or, in other words, the compulsion to produce commodities at their societally current value or preferably below it., NR: 2279, Book ID: Society After Money Dialogue, Processed Text: sinc produc must market limit social relationship privat produc forc competit invers activ produc alway freeli decid product standard action ha given word compuls produc commod societ current valu prefer

TEXT:  The commodities tell the producers what is to be done.

TEXT:  This fetishism is not mere appearance, but rather real objective compulsion, to which producers in competition must yield, in order to remain in business.

TEXT:  An ineluctable logic of things10 determines what can be socially organized and how—and what cannot be.11 Put pointedly: Instead of a conscious social movement of things for sensory-concrete purposes (needs), what arises is an unconscious objectively driven movement of the social for alien abstract aims (increasing money)., NR: 2283, Book ID: Society After Money Dialogue, Processed Text: ineluct logic thing social organ cannot put pointedli instead consciou social movement thing sensori concret purpos need unconsci object driven movement social alien abstract aim increas money
TEXT:  In this process, money as objective-quantitative value relation is the means of (individual or collective) assignment of social obligations (“debts”). Money decides, and it has no morals.12 Valorization Competition and inversion, as well as the primacy of mediation, lead to a compulsion to valorize in production., NR: 2284, Book ID: Society After Money Dialogue, Processed Text: process money object quantit valu relat mean individu collect assign social oblig debt money ha moral valor competit invers well primaci mediat lead compuls valor product

TEXT:  Externalization The constant pressure to lower the price of commodities leads tendentially to the externalization of outlays (= costs) that do not contribute to the sellability of commodities. Externalized aspects can then be re-internalized again, if they raise sellability in a given segment (for instance, organic and fair-trade products) and satisfy additional needs (“good conscience,” etc., NR: 2288, Book ID: Society After Money Dialogue, Processed Text: extern constant pressur lower price commod lead extern outlay cost contribut commod aspect rais given segment instanc organ fair trade product satisfi addit need good conscienc

TEXT:  By virtue of duplication, competition, and the compulsion to (self-)valorization, people are placed in a structural relation of exclusion.

TEXT:  The opposition between the dimensions of use and mediation of the commodity is manifest as opposed interests in social interaction.

TEXT:  Nonetheless, the relative share of unpaid activities—such as caring for children and the sick or disabled, relaxation, education, and volunteering—has fallen in the last decade (Schäfer 2004).

TEXT: ) Mediation As the concept already suggests, systemic self-mediation is connected to the moment of mediation of commodities: their value shape. This means that self-mediation, as supra-historical property of all societies, is realized in capitalism in the form of value-mediation or, reified, of monetary mediation., NR: 2304, Book ID: Society After Money Dialogue, Processed Text: mediat concept alreadi system self mediat connect moment mediat commod valu shape mean self mediat histor properti societi capit form valu mediat monetari mediat

TEXT:  This point has now to be developed. Intermediate Methodological Consideration: Distinguishing between Discourses We can now develop the categorial preconditions for discussing the question whether there can be a post-monetary society and what forms of social mediation can take shape that are not based on individual obligations (“debt”)., NR: 2311, Book ID: Society After Money Dialogue, Processed Text: point ha intermedi methodolog consider distinguish discours develop categori precondit question whether post monetari societi form social mediat take shape base individu oblig debt

What could new non-monetary forms of mediation look like? What could this mean for social relations of mediation and obligation?

Elementary Form: Commons What element-totality interrelationship creates the preconditions for the development of a post-monetary society? Or, to put it differently: As basic matrix of action, what element produces the totality of the new post-monetary societal system and is, at the same time, produced by it?

TEXT:  The commons can be identified as this micro-form.

TEXT:  For whether the potential for need satisfaction is also realized is only to be found out after production (ex post), if mediation, i.e. sale, actually succeeds and the commodity is consumed. This leads to the production of a gigantic collection of commodities, existing side-by-side, whose potential for satisfying needs has not been mediated among each other, since the mediation takes place not via the dimension of usefulness, but rather via the social comparison of outlay, viz., NR: 2329, Book ID: Society After Money Dialogue, Processed Text: whether potenti need satisfact also found product post mediat sale actual commod lead product gigant collect commod side side whose potenti satisfi need ha among sinc mediat take place via dimens use rather via social comparison outlay
TEXT:  value. This has as consequence, in turn, that producers are (and must be) decisively oriented toward minimizing outlay or, in other words, cost reduction. In competition, the pressure is great to externalize all aspects of need that do not promote sellability, in order to lower costs., NR: 2330, Book ID: Society After Money Dialogue, Processed Text: valu ha consequ turn produc must decis toward outlay word cost reduct competit pressur great extern aspect need promot order lower cost
TEXT:  From the point of view of the consumer, different needs come into competition with each other: What cheapens one commodity, and thus makes the need satisfaction it provides more easily accessible, leads, on the other hand, to an impairment of needs (for instance, in production by virtue of poor working conditions or low wages)., NR: 2331, Book ID: Society After Money Dialogue, Processed Text: point view consum differ need come competit one commod thu make need satisfact easili access lead hand impair need instanc product virtu poor work condit low wage
TEXT:  The logic of exclusion on the level of social relations, which was described above, finds its counterpart on the level of the objective satisfaction of needs.

TEXT:  The relation between usefulness and mediation takes a completely different form in the case of the commons.

TEXT:  The needs that are connected to the usefulness are thereby directly and tendentially placed in a relationship before reproduction (ex ante).

TEXT: 20 Commons thus tend to internalize other needs: i.e. to find solutions that can satisfy the primary need without this occurring at the cost of secondary needs.

TEXT:  We can briefly mention the following features of commoning (features of commodity production are given in parentheses to bring out the contrast): •Freedom from domination and voluntariness (objective compulsion and personal command): Since, as a rule, there are structurally no instruments of power in commons, no one can be made to do something that he or she does not want to do, but rather participation occurs, in principle, on a voluntary basis., NR: 2349, Book ID: Society After Money Dialogue, Processed Text: briefli mention follow featur featur commod product given parenthesi bring contrast freedom domin voluntari object compuls person command sinc rule structur instrument power common one made someth doe want rather particip principl voluntari basi
TEXT:  •Contributions (exchange): Interpersonal reciprocity is, in principle, unconditional (see above), so that no social obligation exists on the micro level. The motivation for such uncoupled contributions comes from the productive urge to want to take part in disposition over the collective (and hence societal) process, which is the precondition for securing individual existence., NR: 2350, Book ID: Society After Money Dialogue, Processed Text: contribut exchang interperson reciproc principl uncondit see social oblig micro level motiv uncoupl contribut come product urg want take part disposit collect henc societ process precondit individu exist

The commons society is, then, the transpersonal aggregate network of all socially cooperating mediated commons nodes and represents the level of objective necessities., NR: 2359, Book ID: Society After Money Dialogue, Processed Text: node individu common turn network directli peopl level inter subject possibl see common societi transperson aggreg network social common node level object necess
TEXT:  Interpersonal and transpersonal relationships are depicted as edges and are based on the same qualitative-concrete mode of mediation (on which, more later). A society is, therefore, a layered transpersonal network of personal networks., NR: 2360, Book ID: Society After Money Dialogue, Processed Text: interperson transperson relationship edg base qualit concret mode mediat later societi therefor layer transperson network person network
TEXT:  The topology of such a social network of mediation is characteristic for a specific social form, and hence this is also the case for the commons society. Topologically, the network of a commons society can be described as polycentric and scale-free, and the concept of stigmergy (to be explained below) is suitable for grasping the substantive quality of the mediation., NR: 2361, Book ID: Society After Money Dialogue, Processed Text: topolog social network mediat characterist specif social form henc also case common societi network common societi polycentr scale free concept suitabl grasp substant qualiti mediat
TEXT:  In commons research, polycentricity is used, above all, to describe “self-organized … complex adaptive systems” (Ostrom and Ostrom 2009: 156), such as I have grasped them here as networks. When network systems grow, they do so not only through the emergence of new nodes and edges, but also by virtue of the fact that the network is permanently renovating itself structurally., NR: 2362, Book ID: Society After Money Dialogue, Processed Text: common research use describ self organ complex adapt system network network system grow emerg new node edg also virtu fact network perman structur
TEXT:  A system is described as polycentric when it comprises several dispersed centers that take on governance functions. Certain nodes are increasingly assigned meta-tasks or, in other words, tasks involved in creating the preconditions for the functioning of the other nodes: for instance, developing infrastructure., NR: 2363, Book ID: Society After Money Dialogue, Processed Text: system polycentr sever dispers center take govern function certain node increasingli assign meta task word task involv precondit node instanc infrastructur
TEXT:  Such poly-centers or meta-nodes (here: meta-commons) are also called hubs, and they draw numerous linkages to themselves. With increasingly non-hierarchical distribution of coordinating tasks across several nodes, I speak of distributed self-planning in the network., NR: 2364, Book ID: Society After Money Dialogue, Processed Text: poli center meta node meta common also hub draw numer linkag increasingli non hierarch distribut task across sever node speak distribut self network
TEXT: 24 Along with the continuing inner polycentric differentiation of a large complex network, a scale-free distribution of the network density (or, in other words, of the incoming and outgoing edges) of the nodes is formed., NR: 2365, Book ID: Society After Money Dialogue, Processed Text: along inner polycentr differenti larg complex network scale free distribut network densiti word incom outgo edg node form
TEXT:  This means that the topology is largely self-similar and hence the properties of the network are largely scale-independent: Sections of the network behave like the network as a whole. The ideality of the theory—networks that obey a power law are scale-invariant—has, however, a lower limit in reality: Partial networks that are too small no longer function like the network as a whole., NR: 2366, Book ID: Society After Money Dialogue, Processed Text: mean topolog larg self similar henc properti network larg scale independ section network behav like network whole ideal theori network obey power law scale invari ha howev lower limit realiti partial network small longer function like network whole
TEXT:  Nonetheless, partial scale-independence is an essential property of social organization, since it secures a high degree of robustness vis-à-vis node failures or, in other words, partial damage to the networking (such as occurs, say, during disasters)., NR: 2367, Book ID: Society After Money Dialogue, Processed Text: nonetheless partial scale independ essenti properti social organ sinc high degre robust node failur word partial damag say disast

TEXT:  Stigmergy The concept of stigmergy is derived from the Greek words stigma (στιγμα) for marking and ergon (εργον) for labor. It was coined by the French biologist Pierre-Paul Grassé (1959), who studied the emerging behavior of termites., NR: 2369, Book ID: Society After Money Dialogue, Processed Text: concept deriv word stigma mark ergon labor wa biologist studi behavior termit
TEXT:  In general terms, localized signs indicate subsequent follow-up activities or desired new activities.

TEXT:  Stigmergy is not a novel form of mediation that is limited to a possible commons society, but rather an aspect of every society. The market can, thus, be grasped as a stigmergic system.

TEXT:  In what follows, we present these considerations and discuss them with respect to the following aspects: decisions, conflicts, information, bandwidth, coordination, and planning. Decisions Collective provision for society as a whole requires that decisions be made about what will be done and how., NR: 2372, Book ID: Society After Money Dialogue, Processed Text: present consider discu respect follow aspect decis conflict inform decis collect provis societi whole decis made done
TEXT:  Nowadays, hierarchical procedures are usually employed, in which decision-making power increases the higher one goes in the hierarchy. To this end, field information has to be aggregated upwards, condensed into a decision, and allocated downwards again in the form of process instructions., NR: 2373, Book ID: Society After Money Dialogue, Processed Text: nowaday hierarch procedur usual employ decis make power increas higher one go hierarchi end field inform ha upward condens decis form process instruct
TEXT:  This is meant to ensure that processes involving a division of activity lead to a consistent result. Marx criticized the separation of decision and execution as the “enslaving subordination of individuals under the division of labor” (Marx 1938: 10)., NR: 2374, Book ID: Society After Money Dialogue, Processed Text: meant ensur process divis activ lead consist result separ decis execut subordin individu divis labor
TEXT:  By virtue of this separation, as well as the lack of transparency and limitation of individual opportunity for development that come about when there are many hierarchical levels and a high degree of subdivision into particular steps, a considerable loss of motivation can occur, and external rewards (e., NR: 2375, Book ID: Society After Money Dialogue, Processed Text: virtu separ well lack transpar limit individu opportun develop come mani hierarch level high degre subdivis particular step consider loss motiv occur extern reward
TEXT: g. monetary gratification) are not able to compensate for it (cf. Deci et al. 1999). The flattening of hierarchies and the creation of areas of individual initiative reduces the discrepancy, but cannot offer a fundamental solution to the problem of motivation., NR: 2376, Book ID: Society After Money Dialogue, Processed Text: monetari gratif abl compens flatten hierarchi creation area individu initi discrep cannot offer fundament solut problem motiv
TEXT: 26 This is all the more the case, inasmuch as under conditions of commodity production, the incentives for production are not need-based, but rather value-based. Different variants of majority decision and consensus are often mentioned and applied as alternatives to hierarchical decision-making processes., NR: 2377, Book ID: Society After Money Dialogue, Processed Text: case inasmuch condit commod product incent product need base rather valu base differ variant major decis consensu often appli altern hierarch decis make process
TEXT:  It is claimed that, above all, consensual procedures involve all parties and thus lead to greater motivation than, say, majority decisions. But even consensual procedures have their limits. A consensus is not based on the full agreement of all parties, but rather on a collective process of coming to a decision with which all parties can live and to which, in the end, they can all submit in the interest of common action., NR: 2378, Book ID: Society After Money Dialogue, Processed Text: consensu procedur involv parti thu lead greater motiv say major decis even consensu procedur limit consensu base full agreement parti rather collect process come decis parti live end submit interest common action
TEXT:  The decision and the information that is relevant to it are transparent for the parties; nonetheless—or precisely for this reason—it is often the case that a decision needs to be discussed at great length., NR: 2379, Book ID: Society After Money Dialogue, Processed Text: decis inform relev transpar parti nonetheless precis reason often case decis need great length
TEXT:  The mere fact that a consensus is brought about does not automatically create motivation for all parties. For it can happen that some subordinate their individual views and needs, in the interest of reaching a decision, and this can adversely affect their motivation., NR: 2380, Book ID: Society After Money Dialogue, Processed Text: mere fact consensu brought doe automat creat motiv parti happen subordin individu view need interest reach decis advers affect motiv
TEXT:  If outside factors impact the decision-making process—say, the necessity of taking external economic constraints into account—the difference between one’s own wishes and the externally influenced compulsion can have further negative effects., NR: 2381, Book ID: Society After Money Dialogue, Processed Text: outsid factor impact decis make process say necess take extern econom constraint account differ one wish extern compuls neg effect
TEXT:  Self-selection inverts the direction of the decision: Instead of needing to bring a—whether hierarchically or consensually made—decision to people (with whatever degree of (internalized) pressure), people themselves seek out the decision that is right for them., NR: 2382, Book ID: Society After Money Dialogue, Processed Text: self select direct decis instead need bring whether hierarch consensu made decis peopl whatev degre pressur peopl seek decis right

TEXT:  In a commons society, moreover, it is not counteracted by external pressures (to valorize or the like).27 There thus arises a kind of “do-ocracy” (Habermann 2009: 140f.), in which actors take responsibility for the process and own it., NR: 2384, Book ID: Society After Money Dialogue, Processed Text: common societi moreov extern pressur valor like thu kind ocraci actor take respons process

TEXT:  On the one hand, the infrastructural preconditions for amassing power (the state, property, repressive instances, etc.) are lacking. On the other hand, the organization of interests for the purpose of realizing needs at the expense of others is off-putting and reduces the willingness to cooperate., NR: 2386, Book ID: Society After Money Dialogue, Processed Text: one hand precondit power state properti repress instanc hand organ interest purpos realiz need expens willing
TEXT:  Just as under the conditions of an exclusionary logic, where good reasons exist to prevail, by way of the effective organization of interests, at the expense of others, under the conditions of an inclusionary logic, there are good reasons for everyone continually to win over others as partners for realizing their own respective needs., NR: 2387, Book ID: Society After Money Dialogue, Processed Text: condit exclusionari logic good reason exist prevail way effect organ interest expens condit logic good reason everyon continu win partner realiz respect need
TEXT:  What is more: It becomes increasingly evident, both emotionally and cognitively, that the needs of others are fundamentally included in my needs—not in every individual case, but on average. This means that by satisfying the needs of others, I can also satisfy my own needs., NR: 2388, Book ID: Society After Money Dialogue, Processed Text: becom increasingli evid emot cognit need fundament includ need everi individu case averag mean satisfi need also satisfi need
TEXT:  In a certain way, this also gives rise to competition: not, however, in the old exclusive sense, but rather in the sense of an inclusive winning over of others for the purpose of cooperation. Conflicts that, nonetheless, arise in the process (due, say, to limited possibilities for realization) can likewise only be resolved in a cooperative fashion: by prioritizing implementation, by the search for alternative solutions and, finally, also by individually (or also collectively) seeking out cooperative contexts that are better suited to satisfying one’s needs (per the principle of self-selection)., NR: 2389, Book ID: Society After Money Dialogue, Processed Text: certain way also give rise competit howev old exclus sens rather sens inclus win purpos conflict nonetheless aris process due say limit possibl realiz likewis resolv fashion implement search altern solut final also individu also collect seek context better satisfi one need per principl self select

TEXT: 28 Information The information that mediates processes and decisions can have two sources: Direct process information—also called “sematectonic”29 information—emerges in and along with the activity; indirect or marker-based information is information that accompanies the activity and serves for planning and coordination., NR: 2391, Book ID: Society After Money Dialogue, Processed Text: inform inform process decis two sourc direct process inform also inform along activ indirect marker base inform inform activ serf

TEXT: 31 The idea of an essentially static equilibrium (such as also predominates in the tradition of neoclassical theory formation) is erroneous, since all parameters (needs, procedures, resources, etc.) are continuously changing, such that the guiding concept is rather systemic self-adaptation on the basis of collective intelligence., NR: 2400, Book ID: Society After Money Dialogue, Processed Text: idea essenti static equilibrium also tradit theori format erron sinc paramet need procedur resourc continu concept rather system self adapt basi collect intellig
TEXT:  What drives the emerging coherence is not, however, an abstraction—like value in the case of the market—which indirectly mediates needs, but rather needs themselves. Planning Stigmergic emergence means that—like the “invisible hand” (Adam Smith) in the case of market mediation—social coherence is produced “behind the backs” (Karl Marx) of actors, but that this does not occur blindly, but rather with complete transparency., NR: 2401, Book ID: Society After Money Dialogue, Processed Text: drive coher howev abstract like valu case market indirectli need rather need emerg mean like invis hand smith case market mediat social coher produc behind back actor doe occur blindli rather complet transpar

TEXT:  Knowledge and Capacity for Action Is commons-based stigmergy another way of solving the Hayekian problem of knowledge (cf. Kathöfer and Schröter in the present volume)?

TEXT:  In order to achieve capacity for action, he argued, it is necessary to reduce divided knowledge to manageable quantities and to subject it to a self-mediation.

Do not these social obligations catch up with us and, in the end, find their operative expression in the form of money, after all?

TEXT:  Strictly speaking, every development of individual possibilities in each unique form of human being is a contribution to this mode of life.

TEXT:  But what has been socially acquired can just as well be unacquired again. What is decisive for the argumentation presented here, however, is that the unlearning of social relations of obligation on the inter-individual level of reciprocity is not a categorial precondition for unconditional relations of mediation on supra-individual levels., NR: 2435, Book ID: Society After Money Dialogue, Processed Text: ha social acquir well unacquir decis argument howev unlearn social relat oblig inter individu level reciproc categori precondit uncondit relat mediat individu level

TEXT:  One of these authors is the world’s best-known futurologist, the economist Jeremy Rifkin.

TEXT: ” In the book, Rifkin describes how technological developments are bringing about the gradual demise of capitalism. The main reason he cites is that production costs for every additional output unit will be reduced to (nearly) zero as a result of a “third industrial revolution,” as is currently taking place in the areas of communication, energy, logistics, and 3D printing., NR: 2519, Book ID: Society After Money Dialogue, Processed Text: book technolog develop gradual demis capit main reason cite product cost everi addit output unit reduc nearli zero result third industri revolut current take place area commun energi logist print

TEXT:  Of course “feminist economics” is a broad concept: there are many feminisms and many orientations within economic theory, and theoretically any combination of the two is possible. But what is meant here is neither games-theory-based reflections from a woman’s perspective, as are sometimes to be found in the International Association for Feminist Economics, nor Keynes-inspired reflections on the (entirely reasonable) notion of “gender budgeting,” that is, the practice of taking into consideration gender-specific inequalities in budgetary policy., NR: 2535, Book ID: Society After Money Dialogue, Processed Text: cours feminist econom broad concept mani femin mani orient within econom theori theoret combin two possibl meant neither game theori base reflect woman perspect sometim found intern associ feminist econom inspir reflect entir reason notion gender practic take consider gender specif inequ budgetari polici
TEXT:  In the German-speaking countries, since the 1980s, “feminist economics” has largely stood for analyses, mainly from an eco-feminist perspective, of the exploitation of nature, traditional women’s or reproductive work, and the (post-)colonial North-South relationship—all of this combined with the positive vision of a “subsistence” society, free of money and the logic of exchange., NR: 2536, Book ID: Society After Money Dialogue, Processed Text: german speak countri sinc feminist econom ha larg stood analysi mainli feminist perspect exploit natur tradit woman reproduct work post coloni north south relationship combin posit vision subsist societi free money logic exchang

TEXT:  This was an extremely valuable contribution: building on Rosa Luxemburg’s analysis, it shows that the aim of capitalism is not to permeate the world with capitalism, i.e. not to transform every kind of work into wage labor, but that on the contrary a vital element for the survival of capitalism is its imperialistic ability to exploit resources produced in a non-capitalist manner., NR: 2538, Book ID: Society After Money Dialogue, Processed Text: wa extrem valuabl contribut build analysi show aim capit permeat world capit transform everi kind work wage labor contrari vital element surviv capit imperialist abil exploit resourc produc non capitalist manner

Yet even today there is a systematic tendency to overlook reproductive or care activities, and therefore the prerequisites for what is generally understood as the “economy”. “It really is unfathomable,” as Carola Möller noted twenty years ago, “why it has so far been possible to make unpaid work appear, in the public consciousness, as non-existent and without value” (1998: 471)., NR: 2542, Book ID: Society After Money Dialogue, Processed Text: yet even today systemat tendenc overlook reproduct care activ therefor prerequisit gener understood economi realli unfathom note twenti year ago ha far possibl make unpaid work appear public conscious non exist without valu

TEXT:  Claudia von Werlhof raises the question of whether capitalism is so incapable that it has not yet succeeded in integrating these masses into exploitation, into its system. According to her, the answer to the riddle is very simple: “everything is the reverse of what it seemed: the pillars of accumulation and growth are not the 10 percent free wage laborers, but the 90 percent unfree nonwage laborers; they are the truly exploited, the real ‘producers,’ the ‘norm,’ the general condition of the human being under capitalism” (Werlhof 1984: 257)., NR: 2544, Book ID: Society After Money Dialogue, Processed Text: rais question whether capit incap ha yet mass exploit system accord answer riddl simpl everyth revers pillar accumul growth percent free wage labor percent unfre labor truli real produc norm gener condit human capit

TEXT:  After all, not only products but also the means of production should be in the possession of those who need (and use) them. The increasing decentralization and thus democratization of production opportunities means—and this is Rifkin’s central thesis—“that anyone and eventually everyone can access the means of production, making the question of who should own and control the means of production irrelevant, and capitalism with it” (2014: 112)., NR: 2570, Book ID: Society After Money Dialogue, Processed Text: product also mean product possess need use increas thu democrat product opportun mean central thesi anyon eventu everyon access mean product make question control mean product irrelev capit

TEXT:  It is no coincidence that it is predominantly feminist theorists who, based on the recognition of a lifelong mutual dependency, emphasize this broad spectrum of motivations. Brigitte Kratzwald (2014) sums it up with the phrase “between pleasure and necessity,” while the theologian Ina Praetorius, who lives in Switzerland, describes such motivations for action as the “rediscovery of what has been taken for granted” (Wiederentdeckung des Selbstverständlichen): the fact that most of us become active as a matter of course when we see the necessity for it., NR: 2573, Book ID: Society After Money Dialogue, Processed Text: coincid predominantli feminist theorist base recognit lifelong mutual depend emphas broad spectrum motiv sum phrase pleasur necess theologian life motiv action rediscoveri ha taken de fact becom activ matter cours see necess
TEXT:  “It can be taken for granted that humans, as creatures who are free in relatedness, want to increase more than their personal benefits” (2015: 54). This should not be confused with altruism.

TEXT:  And, as studies of time use prove, this leads almost seamlessly—as ever—to an increase in women’s work. The limited rationalizability and therefore the limited profit in care work has always meant, in capitalism, that this is outsourced to underprivileged segments of the population, be it women in general, or (as in the past) black slaves, or (as is increasingly the case today) migrants in global care chains—though it is well known that in these cases too such activities are mainly left to women., NR: 2590, Book ID: Society After Money Dialogue, Processed Text: studi time use prove lead almost seamlessli ever increas woman work limit therefor limit profit care work ha alway meant capit underprivileg segment popul woman gener past black slave increasingli case today migrant global care chain though well known case activ mainli left woman

TEXT:  At the same time, in keeping with the idea of care or concern, the different attitude to nature can be seen as another thing that care and commons share. Both approaches are strongly linked to an understanding of nature such as that expressed by the indigenous concept of “Pachamama” (Mother Earth): nature is not seen as separate from humans, and as an exploitable resource; instead humans are to be understood as a part of nature; in this sense the original indigenous expressions for buen vivir—generally rendered as “good living”—can perhaps be better translated as “good living together., NR: 2594, Book ID: Society After Money Dialogue, Processed Text: time keep idea care concern differ attitud natur seen anoth thing care common share approach strongli link understand natur express indigen concept mother earth natur seen separ human exploit resourc instead human understood part natur sens origin indigen express gener good live perhap better good live togeth
TEXT: ” Care activities are focused on the well-being of others, and therefore do not lend themselves to profitable exploitation. Thus those who work in this area, mostly women, often have fewer problems overcoming the logic of exchange, because the logic of care allows a different way of looking at economic activity as a whole: if giving food to a sick person is care, why should growing the food not be care? If putting a child to bed is care, why should producing the bed not be care? Furthermore, the area of reproductive work, or more precisely care work, highlights something that is true of any form of activity: that it inevitably becomes alienated as long as it is carried out in exchange for food (German: Lebensmittel, literally “the means of life”), and therefore under compulsion., NR: 2595, Book ID: Society After Money Dialogue, Processed Text: care activ well therefor lend profit exploit thu work area mostli woman often problem logic exchang logic care differ way look econom activ whole give food sick person care grow food care child bed care bed care furthermor area reproduct work precis care work highlight someth true form activ inevit becom long carri exchang food german liter mean life therefor compuls

TEXT:  Moreover, if we are to avoid constructing people as inferior in order to be able to impose the less profitable reproductive tasks on them, then the necessary prerequisite is a society in which the logic of exchange is overcome, and with it the discrepancy (caused by the compulsion to pursue profit) between the evaluation of “productive” and “reproductive” activities., NR: 2598, Book ID: Society After Money Dialogue, Processed Text: moreov avoid peopl inferior order abl impos less profit reproduct task necessari prerequisit societi logic exchang overcom discrep compuls pursu profit evalu product reproduct activ
TEXT:  The word “construct” (“constructing people as inferior”) is deliberately chosen here, since from a queer feminist perspective this is about more than the mere distribution of jobs to men and women, white and black people, or Germans and migrants: in every society, what women are, what black people are etc., NR: 2599, Book ID: Society After Money Dialogue, Processed Text: word construct peopl inferior deliber chosen sinc queer feminist perspect mere distribut job men woman white black peopl german migrant everi societi woman black peopl

TEXT:  It also means that it is not capitalism per se that causes racism, sexism etc., but that it “only” gives structural support for dividing people into identity categories.

TEXT:  Point (1) is important, since otherwise one leaves one’s public or interlocutor confused and frustrated.

TEXT:  I do not want only to call for this, but also to provide it. From a feminist and anti-racist perspective, the fact that human beings are always part of their society is a platitude. For why was it so difficult in the nineteenth century to argue that women or black people are not less intelligent than white men?

TEXT:  When it is a matter of breaking up the view of human nature as being driven by egoism, this does not imply that in a “good” society, people would exclusively honor altruism and total self-sacrifice. But it obviously makes a difference whether we live in a society in which the asocial qualities receive the greatest recognition (because they represent the absolute precondition for success) or we live in a society in which these conceptualizations would be recognized as false oppositions and overcome, because only very few activities are covered by them and (re)production is accordingly organized in such a way that they have hardly any significance in day-to-day life., NR: 2656, Book ID: Society After Money Dialogue, Processed Text: matter break view human natur driven egoism doe impli good societi peopl would exclus honor altruism total self sacrific obvious make differ whether live societi asoci qualiti receiv recognit repres absolut precondit success live societi would fals opposit overcom activ cover product accordingli organ way hardli signific day day life

TEXT:  So, if it is not social structures that could steer behavior in the socially desirable direction, what is it then? One possible, partial answer is the reference to the variety of human interests and desires to act, which in Stefan’s contribution is called the Stigmergic Law: “Given enough people and commons, a person or commons will be found for every task that has to be done., NR: 2686, Book ID: Society After Money Dialogue, Processed Text: social structur could steer behavior social desir direct one possibl partial answer refer varieti human interest desir act contribut law given enough peopl common person common found everi task ha done

It is not clear from the original Stigmergic Law which formulation is intended, but this makes a huge difference with regard to the underlying concept of human being., NR: 2688, Book ID: Society After Money Dialogue, Processed Text: mayb instead enough interest say rather may interest task take anyway due insight social necessari clear origin law formul intend make huge differ regard underli concept human
TEXT:  If it is a matter of interest in doing something, then what underlies this is the conception of a humanity that disposes, as a whole, over a gigantic potential for different interests and desires to act: more than enough so that for all tasks—even for those that from an individual perspective seem most boring or thankless—a sufficient number of people are available that find them highly interesting and motivating., NR: 2689, Book ID: Society After Money Dialogue, Processed Text: matter interest someth concept human whole gigant potenti differ interest desir act enough task even individu perspect seem bore thankless suffici number peopl avail find highli interest

This is an argument that, for good reason, is well known to us from contemporary neo-liberal discourse: Extorting good behavior and sanctioning are elementary components of commodity production—as is, for instance, explained to us on a daily basis in the context of the German “Hartz 4” welfare benefit regime., NR: 2697, Book ID: Society After Money Dialogue, Processed Text: thu would like sanction attach cost excess provid degre harm argument good reason well known contemporari neo liber discours good behavior elementari compon commod product instanc daili basi context german welfar benefit regim

TEXT:  I provide an experimental description of how this can occur on the categorial level in my contribution to this book. Stigmergy plays a key role in the mediation here. But mediation implies that there can be no steering of the process in accordance with external standards (like in the case of the commodity, whereby the ability to valorize serves as external standard), but rather stigmergy is a means for self-organization and self-planning., NR: 2705, Book ID: Society After Money Dialogue, Processed Text: provid experiment descript occur categori level contribut book play key role mediat mediat steer process accord extern standard like case commod wherebi abil valor serf extern standard rather mean self organ self

TEXT:  (7) Do Not Demonize Exchange Christian Siefkes Stefan, you are emotionalizing our debate by using ethically highly charged concepts like “extortion.” Everyone knows that extortion is reprehensible. When one speaks, as you do, of “extortion and sanctions” always as a pair, this suggests that applying sanction is just as reprehensible—even that sanctions are hardly to be distinguished from extortion., NR: 2729, Book ID: Society After Money Dialogue, Processed Text: demon exchang debat ethic highli concept like extort everyon know extort reprehens one extort sanction alway pair sanction reprehens even sanction hardli distinguish extort
TEXT:  And in the case of exchange, you say explicitly that you regard it as a “form of reciprocal extortion” and hence cannot accept it as “foundation for human interrelationships.” But at least as regards exchange, the picture is skewed, since extortion requires an active role: I threaten someone else with negative consequences, in case he or she fails to meet my demands., NR: 2730, Book ID: Society After Money Dialogue, Processed Text: case exchang say explicitli regard form reciproc extort henc cannot accept foundat human least regard exchang pictur skew sinc extort activ role threaten someon els neg consequ case meet demand

TEXT:  But your claim sounds more general: Every sort of sanction is to be rejected.

It is possible that findings deriving from the view of human nature, or concept of human being, could allay the fear that in a production-driven society (in which potential producers decide how and where to get involved as they see fit), the consumer perspective would be neglected (because consumers cannot do anything more than to provide indications of their needs and wishes and then to hope for the best)., NR: 2749, Book ID: Society After Money Dialogue, Processed Text: one key question book exchang contribut wa produc side consum side possibl find view human natur concept human could allay fear product driven societi potenti produc decid get involv see fit consum perspect would consum cannot anyth provid indic need wish hope best

TEXT:  Even in the absence of structural sanctions, will there still, nonetheless, be sanctions on an interpersonal level? Must there be for a free society to function? Similarly as in the case of post-exchange, I would answer the question of post-sanctions as follows: Such sanctions may exist, but they no longer have any socially constitutive function., NR: 2772, Book ID: Society After Money Dialogue, Processed Text: even absenc structur sanction still nonetheless sanction interperson level must free societi function similarli case post exchang would answer question post sanction sanction may exist longer social constitut function
TEXT:  Unlike you, Christian, I do not think that rules have necessarily to be linked to sanctions, in order to be effective.

TEXT:  But this is part of the conflict resolution that, from my point of view, will acquire considerably greater significance as compared to today.

TEXT:  Exchange, extortion and sanctions are to be abolished as structural relations and to be brought back as conflict resolution in the interpersonal domain.

But once I bring also my favorite activities onto the market—and possibly have to learn that they are “of no value” in the competition with other activities—can I really, then, still take pleasure in contributing them? Or if, on the contrary, I see that my activities are treated as valuable, perhaps because others cannot replace them, will I not, then, start to hold back on them, instead of taking pleasure in my contributions? You already called attention to one aspect, Stefan, but it is so important to me that I would like briefly to repeat it: Currently, thousands upon thousands are starving around the world, precisely because they have nothing to exchange., NR: 2783, Book ID: Society After Money Dialogue, Processed Text: cours never case activ popular bring also favorit activ onto market possibl learn valu competit activ realli still take pleasur contrari see activ valuabl perhap cannot replac start hold back instead take pleasur contribut alreadi attent one aspect import would like briefli repeat current thousand upon thousand around world precis noth exchang
TEXT:  They can leave behind as many signs and wishes as they like, and they can continue hoping until the end.

Even if I would argue that the crying of the baby is more than a stigmergic signal, the example could also have gone as follows: “When an oven signals that the rolls in the oven are ready, we would also turn it off when we are not paid for doing so and even when it is not at all clear that the rolls are for us., NR: 2789, Book ID: Society After Money Dialogue, Processed Text: reflect fact everi quot point passag even would argu cri babi signal exampl could also gone oven signal roll oven readi would also turn even clear roll

TEXT:  What, above all, comes into play, however, is that we have learned to be guided exclusively by money and self-interest outside the family—and hence the so-called gummy bear effect: namely, all those experiments that show that people cease to act helpfully or responsibly when money—or, in the case of children, gummy bears, for instance—comes into play., NR: 2791, Book ID: Society After Money Dialogue, Processed Text: come play howev learn exclus money self interest outsid famili henc gummi bear effect name experi show peopl ceas act help respons money case child gummi bear instanc come play
TEXT:  It is also for this reason that Ina Praetorius (2015) speaks of the “rediscovery of the self-evident.” People do not always think so much in terms of their self-interest.

For example, there are fewer and fewer market-related economic reasons to cultivate organic foods. I use this example, because I wonder if you see capitalism—which in some parts of the USA, which are known as “food deserts,” does not provide any more fresh food—as the outcome of free consumer choices?

TEXT:  2012: 59). This would be one possible form of self-evidence in a society without money. Yes, Christian and also Stefan, empirically existing commons are often connected to sanctions. But Elinor Ostrom found that these seldom amount to more than a fraction of the monetary value that a violation of the rules would yield (cf., NR: 2799, Book ID: Society After Money Dialogue, Processed Text: would one possibl form self evid societi without money ye also common often connect sanction found seldom amount fraction monetari valu violat rule would yield
TEXT:  Ostrom 1990: 59). In other words, following the rules was economically irrational despite the sanctions. Nonetheless, they were hardly violated. So, what is the use of the sanctions?

TEXT:  Since, however, the latter do not create any value, their expansion signifies a tendency to transcend value and, thereby, surplus-value, profit, and money. 1. Promises More than two thousand years ago, Aristotle already described his dream of the end of slaveholder society: Tools may be animate as well as inanimate; for instance, a ship’s captain uses a lifeless rudder, but a living man for watch … So any piece of property can be regarded as a tool enabling a man to live, and his property is an assemblage of such tools; a slave is a sort of living piece of property; and like any other servant is a tool in charge of other tools., NR: 2822, Book ID: Society After Money Dialogue, Processed Text: sinc howev latter creat valu expans tendenc transcend valu therebi surplu valu profit money promis two thousand year ago alreadi dream end slavehold societi tool may anim well inanim instanc ship captain us lifeless rudder live man watch piec properti tool man live properti assemblag tool slave sort live piec properti like servant tool charg tool

TEXT:  Aristotle, Politics, I, iv, 1253b1 Karl Marx took up this dream, concretized it and modernized it, and he thereby gave a new perspective to economics: But to the degree that large industry develops, the creation of real wealth comes to depend less on labor time and on the amount of labor employed than … on the general state of science and on the progress of technology, or the application of this science to production … With that, production based on exchange value breaks down … The measure of wealth is then not any longer, in any way, labor time, but rather disposable time., NR: 2824, Book ID: Society After Money Dialogue, Processed Text: polit took dream therebi gave new perspect econom degre larg industri creation real wealth come depend less labor time amount labor employ gener state scienc progress technolog applic scienc product product base exchang valu break measur wealth longer way labor time rather dispos time

TEXT:  Input-output analysis shows the interdependencies of an economy on the level of economic sectors or industries and answers the questions: “What industry supplies goods to what industry in what quantity?” and “What goods are acquired in what quantity for producing the goods of an industry?” Input-output analysis corresponds to the Marxian concepts of use-value and exchange-value., NR: 2875, Book ID: Society After Money Dialogue, Processed Text: input output analysi show economi level econom sector industri answer question industri suppli good industri quantiti good acquir quantiti good industri input output analysi concept use valu exchang valu
TEXT:  The duality of the commodity, which is already emphasized at the beginning of the first volume of Capital, is thematized in Leontief’s input-output analysis as “primal” and “dual” problem.7 The primal problem deals with use-values (measured in quantities or units of measurement or weight, e., NR: 2876, Book ID: Society After Money Dialogue, Processed Text: dualiti commod alreadi begin first volum capit input output analysi primal dual problem primal problem deal use valu measur quantiti unit measur weight

TEXT:  The point of departure here is equation (2), Leontief’s dual problem, which defines unit prices. If instead of the value created per unit, q, the living labor per unit, n, is used in the formula, the unit values, w, of commodities from the equation wA + n = w (3) can be determined as w = n (E-A)−1 (4) n symbolizes the row vector of living labor-time per unit; A, as above, is the matrix of technical coefficients., NR: 2899, Book ID: Society After Money Dialogue, Processed Text: point departur equat dual problem unit price instead valu per unit live labor per unit use formula unit valu commod equat determin row vector live labor time per unit matrix technic coeffici

In recent decades, it has become ever more important to answer this question, since services (both personal and economic services) already represent two-thirds to three-quarters of gross domestic product in the EU., NR: 2907, Book ID: Society After Money Dialogue, Processed Text: consum articl everi moment time alongsid consum articl form good quantiti consum articl form servic role servic play theori valu recent decad ha becom ever import answer question sinc servic person econom servic alreadi repres two third three quarter gross domest product
TEXT:  Our current society is hence described by some as a “service society.” 4.1 Characteristics of Services Drawing on the above Marx quote, the author has formulated the following characteristics of services in the calculation of value., NR: 2908, Book ID: Society After Money Dialogue, Processed Text: current societi henc servic societi characterist servic draw quot author ha follow characterist servic calcul valu
TEXT:  These observations are only valid on the abstract level of the creation of value: 1.Although, as a rule, services possess no material form, they have a use-value.

TEXT:  2.As such, a service can neither be re-sold nor stored or accumulated, since it is consumed (e.g. the hearing of a concert or a transport service provided by a taxi). 3.A service makes no direct contribution either to the economic surplus product or to surplus-value., NR: 2910, Book ID: Society After Money Dialogue, Processed Text: servic neither sold sinc hear concert transport servic provid taxi servic make direct contribut either econom surplu product surplu valu
TEXT:  4.Due to their production costs, services possess an exchange-value on the abstract level of value creation. Like in commodity production, the production costs are composed of the depreciation of constant capital and of circulating capital and variable capital., NR: 2911, Book ID: Society After Money Dialogue, Processed Text: due product cost servic possess exchang valu abstract level valu creation like commod product product cost compos depreci constant capit capit variabl capit
TEXT:  In the case of services, however, a surplus-value as a component of living labor does not exist, nor does a surplus product.

TEXT:  4.2 Exchange of Equivalents The above-mentioned assumptions ensure that exchange of equivalents is present: i.e. that on the abstract level, a commodity can be “fairly” exchanged for another commodity (without one of the partners in the exchange taking advantage of the other)., NR: 2913, Book ID: Society After Money Dialogue, Processed Text: exchang equival assumpt ensur exchang equival present abstract level commod fairli anoth commod without one partner exchang take advantag

If this was not possible on the basis of the assumptions, a contradiction would be present., NR: 2914, Book ID: Society After Money Dialogue, Processed Text: alway case amount social necessari labor time two bundl good equal wa possibl basi assumpt contradict would present
TEXT:  The first chapters of Capital examine the capitalist economy on the following presupposition: “The value of a commodity is related to the value of any other commodity as the labor-time necessary for the production of the one is related to the labor-time necessary for the production of the other” (Marx 1976: 130)., NR: 2915, Book ID: Society After Money Dialogue, Processed Text: first chapter capit examin capitalist economi follow presupposit valu commod relat valu commod labor time necessari product one relat labor time necessari product

TEXT:  4.3 Value Modifications In the third volume of Capital, Marx shows, among other things, that the exchange of equivalents, which for small commodity producers still had its justification on the abstract level, no longer applies with the transition to capitalism., NR: 2917, Book ID: Society After Money Dialogue, Processed Text: valu modif third volum capit show among thing exchang equival small commod produc still justif abstract level longer transit capit
TEXT:  The hunt for maximum profit rates leads to the shifting of constant capital into those branches that promise higher profits than one’s own industry. The values of commodities now no longer follow the amount of labor-time expended, but rather are transformed into prices of production, which, in ideal-typical terms, are determined (also, of course, for services) by the application of the average rate of profit to the cost price (Marx 1981: 264ff., NR: 2918, Book ID: Society After Money Dialogue, Processed Text: hunt maximum profit rate lead shift constant capit branch promis higher profit one industri valu commod longer follow amount labor time rather price product ideal typic term determin also cours servic applic averag rate profit cost price
TEXT: ). Under the heading of the “transformation problem,” this step of concretization has been debated for over a hundred years.

TEXT:  In this connection, the question arises of what variables actually bring about the different value modifications in the Leontief model. In a closed economy with several sectors, but without foreign trade and without money, an easy answer can be given: It depends on how the surplus product is distributed among the different economic branches., NR: 2922, Book ID: Society After Money Dialogue, Processed Text: connect question variabl actual bring differ valu modif model close economi sever sector without foreign trade without money easi answer given surplu product distribut among differ econom branch
TEXT:  If the economy is to remain in equilibrium (such that all markets can be cleared), the respective unit prices will have to change. With constant technical conditions (the same technical coefficients and the same productivity of labor) and the same consumption by wage-earners, all possible value modifications (and hence too the prices proportional to the value modifications) can be generated by way of different allocations of the surplus product., NR: 2923, Book ID: Society After Money Dialogue, Processed Text: economi remain equilibrium market respect unit price chang constant technic condit technic coeffici product labor consumpt wage earner possibl valu modif henc price proport valu modif way differ alloc surplu product

TEXT:  Figure 7 The economy—an evolving social construct. 4.4 Productive/Unproductive and Value-Producing/Value-Consuming Labor Under the heading of “productive and unproductive labor,” the question of services was already considered by Adam Smith and Karl Marx., NR: 2925, Book ID: Society After Money Dialogue, Processed Text: figur economi social construct product unproduct valu valu consum labor head product unproduct labor question servic wa alreadi consid smith
TEXT:  For Marx, who was looking to discover the laws of motion of capitalism, two different definitions of productive labor are conflated in Smith. He only treats the first one as correct: “Only labor which produces capital is productive labor” (Marx 1963: 156)., NR: 2926, Book ID: Society After Money Dialogue, Processed Text: wa look discov law motion capit two differ definit product labor conflat smith treat first one correct labor produc capit product labor
TEXT:  The only labor that is productive is labor that produces a profit for the entrepreneur who uses it. This definition—according to Marx—can completely disregard the content of labor. It does not matter if a business produces commodities or services, so long as a profit is obtained., NR: 2927, Book ID: Society After Money Dialogue, Processed Text: labor product labor produc profit entrepreneur us definit accord complet disregard content labor doe matter busi produc commod servic long profit
TEXT:  The second definition of productive labor that Marx finds in Smith is “labor which in general ‘produces a value’ ” (Marx 1963: 156). What is at issue here is another property of labor: namely, that it is value-creating., NR: 2928, Book ID: Society After Money Dialogue, Processed Text: second definit product labor find smith labor gener produc valu issu anoth properti labor name valu
TEXT:  Hence, in the sense of Adam Smith’s second definition, such labor is unproductive as it creates no value and thus also no surplus-value and thus also no surplus product.

TEXT:  On the assumption of an economy that is in equilibrium, they can be viewed as an approximation of the profits required by the industry for its financing. In equilibrium, such prices must get established so as to allow service industries to have profits that they can invest., NR: 2933, Book ID: Society After Money Dialogue, Processed Text: assumpt economi equilibrium approxim profit industri equilibrium price must get establish allow servic industri profit invest

TEXT:  A business or an industry is productive in Marx’s sense (i.e. the labor imparts value), if the corresponding column entry of the surplus matrix displays positive values: hence, a profit is being made., NR: 2935, Book ID: Society After Money Dialogue, Processed Text: busi industri product sens labor valu correspond column entri surplu matrix display posit valu henc profit made
TEXT:  It is unproductive in Marx’s sense, if the column entry is zero: hence, no profit is obtained. A business is value-creating, if the corresponding row entry is greater than zero, in which case a surplus product and, hence too, a surplus value is being produced., NR: 2936, Book ID: Society After Money Dialogue, Processed Text: unproduct sens column entri zero henc profit busi valu correspond row entri greater zero case surplu product henc surplu valu produc
TEXT:  A business is value-consuming, if the corresponding row entry is zero. It is thus entirely possible to demonstrate both aspects of being productive independently of each other. It should be noted that consumption goods and changes in stock are ignored in the surplus matrix., NR: 2937, Book ID: Society After Money Dialogue, Processed Text: busi valu consum correspond row entri zero thu entir possibl demonstr aspect product independ note consumpt good chang stock surplu matrix

TEXT:  Why would we want to get rid of money? The medium of money has three functions: payment, valuation, and storage. In every economy based on money, storage tends to dominate over the other functions.

TEXT:  The design for a non-money economy would be that of a fundamental utopia, and it would stand in opposition to an economy based on money. A non-money economy would do away with the possibility of storing values and assets; it would replace the functions of valuation and payment with a system that distributes things and activities using algorithms., NR: 2999, Book ID: Society After Money Dialogue, Processed Text: design non money economi would fundament utopia would stand opposit economi base money non money economi would away possibl valu asset would replac function valuat payment system thing activ algorithm
TEXT:  This is already possible, technically speaking, because we keep digital records of every transaction, and we can crunch enough data to replace the market’s information function. In this sense, the concept of a non-money economy represents a radical, leftist utopia: an economy that would strive toward equal distribution and that would do so by changing the current system in a fundamental way, based on money’s role as a medium., NR: 3000, Book ID: Society After Money Dialogue, Processed Text: alreadi possibl technic speak keep digit record everi transact crunch enough data replac market inform function sens concept non money economi radic leftist utopia economi would strive toward equal distribut would current system fundament way base money role medium

TEXT:  Today, almost the entire economy operates under the regime of money. But this doesn’t mean we’ve reached the end of the story.

TEXT:  Rather than labor, the act of giving—the essential transaction—should serve as the basis for the economy. That’s for the simple reason that it’s possible to work without being part of the economy, for example by working entirely for one’s own sake and without having an effect on others., NR: 3011, Book ID: Society After Money Dialogue, Processed Text: rather labor act give essenti transact serv basi economi simpl reason possibl work without part economi exampl work entir one sake without effect
TEXT:  In contrast, a transaction always creates a social relationship of some kind. As a result, division—not labor—is the primary act involved in the creation of an economy built on the division of labor.

TEXT:  The notion of labor is intrinsic to money economies in the form of paid, productive activity. In the absence of money, the economic value of an activity is determined by whether and how it is shared. Every format and structure both of giving and of exchange—payments, prices, values, buyers, consumption, supply, demand, and markets—can be traced back to simple acts of giving., NR: 3013, Book ID: Society After Money Dialogue, Processed Text: notion labor intrins money economi form product activ absenc money econom valu activ determin whether everi format structur give exchang payment price valu buyer consumpt suppli demand market back simpl act give

TEXT:  With the shift from a centralized system of inscription to a decentralized one, namely money, forgiving debts went out of fashion.

TEXT:  First, people gave, they helped, they lent. The concept of property did not exist.

Matching Matching is the most important process in a non-money economy., NR: 3041, Book ID: Society After Money Dialogue, Processed Text: economi base money abl plan emerg nich obscur corner network spread match match import process non money economi

But do we really need to save the job of truck driver? What about that of the launderer, who used to wash clothes by hand in the river, and whose job was made obsolete by washing machines? Why not go back to the time of human “computers,” primarily women, who once worked in large offices doing calculations by hand?

TEXT:  Golumbia 2015; Ortlieb 2014). The objection that one simply does not need any replacement for the coordinating mechanisms, since all coordination could take place in direct (verbal?) communication, is not a realistic response—even leaving aside the fact that direct (verbal?) communication would, then, be the replacement (see below)., NR: 3154, Book ID: Society After Money Dialogue, Processed Text: object one simpli doe need replac mechan sinc could take place direct verbal commun realist respons even leav asid fact direct verbal commun would replac see

Hayek described the coordinating role of the market in terms of knowledge., NR: 3155, Book ID: Society After Money Dialogue, Processed Text: order approach question concern altern form discu august peopl arch liber classic sens tireless defend market role market term knowledg
TEXT:  For Hayek, the special role of the market is to serve as a kind of medium that can actualize and coordinate the dispersed knowledge of society’s members: “The various ways in which the knowledge on which people base their plans is communicated to them is the crucial problem for any theory explaining the economic process” (Hayek [1945] 1948: 78)., NR: 3156, Book ID: Society After Money Dialogue, Processed Text: special role market serv kind medium actual dispers knowledg societi member variou way knowledg peopl base plan crucial problem theori explain econom process
TEXT: 3 But this knowledge is not available to anybody in its entirety; it is distributed. In addition, it is situated, as Hayek never ceases to emphasize. More precisely, he differentiates various forms of knowledge: We can distinguish roughly between global, universal knowledge—like, say, the knowledge of the natural sciences—and the local, situated knowledge that is required for carrying out economic operations., NR: 3157, Book ID: Society After Money Dialogue, Processed Text: knowledg avail anybodi entireti distribut addit situat never ceas emphas precis variou form knowledg distinguish roughli global univers knowledg like say knowledg natur scienc local situat knowledg carri econom oper

TEXT:  This is Hayek’s fundamental argument against every form of central economic planning. Thus, he emphasizes: If we can agree that the economic problem of society is mainly one of rapid adaptation to changes in the particular circumstances of time and place, it would seem to follow that the ultimate decisions must be left to the people who are familiar with these circumstances, who know directly of the relevant changes and of the resources immediately available to meet them., NR: 3159, Book ID: Society After Money Dialogue, Processed Text: fundament argument everi form central econom thu agre econom problem societi mainli one rapid adapt chang particular circumst time place would seem follow ultim decis must left peopl familiar circumst know directli relev chang resourc immedi avail meet
TEXT:  We cannot expect that this problem will be solved by first communicating all this knowledge to a central board which, after integrating all knowledge, issues its orders.

TEXT:  But this answers only part of our problem. We need decentralization because only thus can we insure that the knowledge of the particular circumstances of time and place will be promptly used.

TEXT:  There still remains the problem of communicating to him such further information as he needs to fit his decisions into the whole pattern of changes of the larger economic system. Hayek [1945] 1948: 83–84; emphasis added This “communication of information” already sounds a lot like a medial process: One need only, for example, think of the fact that Friedrich Kittler (1993: 8) defined media as technologies for saving, processing and communicating information., NR: 3162, Book ID: Society After Money Dialogue, Processed Text: still remain problem commun inform need fit decis whole pattern chang econom system emphasi ad commun inform alreadi sound lot like medial process one need exampl think fact defin medium technolog save commun inform

TEXT: 6 The first reason why our project has to deal with Hayek is that a post-monetary society must be able to specify a different mechanism of coordination. And it must, moreover, be one that is not susceptible to the same extent or at all to the problems of money-centered coordination: hence, say, the accumulation of monetary symbols as an end-in-itself, with possible consequences like the destruction of the environment, or the increasing rendering superfluous of people in the production process, with serious economic disturbances as consequence., NR: 3164, Book ID: Society After Money Dialogue, Processed Text: first reason project ha deal post monetari societi must abl specifi differ mechan must moreov one suscept extent problem money center henc say accumul monetari symbol end possibl consequ like destruct environ increas render superflu peopl product process seriou econom disturb consequ

TEXT:  That medial processes are central to Hayek became especially clear during and after the so-called “socialist calculation debate” between Mises, Hayek and their critics.

TEXT:  Indeed, it may be considered as a computing device of the pre-electronic age.”10 So, if the market and its price system are a kind of digital medium (inasmuch as prices are digital—they do not involve any continuum, but only discrete gradations), what, then, does the emergence of digital media in the narrower sense mean? Could the price system not only be disrupted by these digital media, as already discussed, but possibly even, in a positive sense, replaced by them?

TEXT:  This is an important point, to which we will return below.)

TEXT:  He differentiates the market as a kind of computer, in the sense just discussed, from an understanding of the market (following Hayek) as a kind of system of communication. This is underscored by the fact that Hayek ([1945] 1948: 87) described the “price system as a kind of machinery for registering change, or a system of telecommunications”—a description which is reminiscent, say, of the telephone network., NR: 3176, Book ID: Society After Money Dialogue, Processed Text: market kind comput sens understand market follow kind system commun fact price system kind machineri chang system descript reminisc say telephon network

TEXT:  In any case, the following description of the market by Hayek ([1945] 1948: 86) already sounds a lot like a network: “The whole acts as one market, not because any of its members survey the whole field, but because their limited individual fields of vision sufficiently overlap so that through many intermediaries the relevant information is communicated to all., NR: 3183, Book ID: Society After Money Dialogue, Processed Text: case follow descript market alreadi sound lot like network whole act one market member survey whole field limit individu field vision suffici overlap mani intermediari relev inform

TEXT: ) Concerning the market, Lavoie (1990: 78; emphasis added) writes: “This knowledge, as encapsulated in prices, serves in turn to guide the decisions of individual participants.” If knowledge transfer is so important, one could ask whether it would not be far better if the knowledge were not “encapsulated in prices,” but rather directly available (unless one could separately show that this “encapsulation” is indispensable: e., NR: 3187, Book ID: Society After Money Dialogue, Processed Text: concern market emphasi ad knowledg price serf turn guid decis individu particip knowledg transfer import one could ask whether would far better knowledg price rather directli avail unless one could separ show encapsul indispens
TEXT: g. as a kind of reduction of complexity). A decentralized collection, processing and distribution of information could take place using data networks. One should by no means think here only of communication in the sense of exchange in a natural language, but rather one should also consider the possibilities created by the rendering mobile of the internet in the form, for instance, of mobile and GPS-tracked devices., NR: 3188, Book ID: Society After Money Dialogue, Processed Text: kind reduct complex collect distribut inform could take place data network one mean think commun sens exchang natur languag rather one also consid possibl render mobil form instanc mobil track devic
TEXT:  These mobile media are in keeping with the “knowledge of the particular circumstances of time and place” on which Hayek placed so much emphasis. Today, mobile media are essentially situated media. Hence, they can, in principle, depict and process local knowledge and thus connect it with other local knowledge in a network., NR: 3189, Book ID: Society After Money Dialogue, Processed Text: mobil medium keep knowledg particular circumst time place much emphasi today mobil medium essenti situat medium henc principl depict process local knowledg thu connect local knowledg network
TEXT:  There is another aspect to be found in Hayek that is not identical with the question of the spatio-temporal situatedness of knowledge: namely, the question of “tacit knowledge” (cf. Oguz 2010). The thesis is as follows: “The impossibility of conveying tacit knowledge of market participants to a higher authority became central to his defense of decentralization and free market” (Oguz 2010: 146)., NR: 3190, Book ID: Society After Money Dialogue, Processed Text: anoth aspect found ident question tempor knowledg name question tacit knowledg thesi imposs tacit knowledg market particip higher author central defens free market
TEXT: 13 Presumably, this means that the market makes knowledge usable that participants themselves cannot articulate—and hence a central planning cannot make usable. However, the assumption that the price system somehow makes this tacit knowledge available, after all—in a “communicative process,” as Lavoie (1990: 78) writes—shows that it is not entirely incommunicable, since otherwise it could not have any relevance for the market process either., NR: 3191, Book ID: Society After Money Dialogue, Processed Text: presum mean market make knowledg usabl particip cannot articul henc central cannot make usabl howev assumpt price system somehow make tacit knowledg avail commun process show entir incommunic sinc otherwis could relev market process either
TEXT:  Hence, is it not conceivable that non-verbalized knowledge could also be made operational in a different way? And do not the techniques of profiling and tracking that are characteristic of “social media,” as they are tellingly called, do just that? We will return to this point below., NR: 3192, Book ID: Society After Money Dialogue, Processed Text: henc conceiv non knowledg could also made oper differ way techniqu characterist social medium tellingli return point
TEXT:  It is likewise by no means apparent why only the market or competition can function as a discovery procedure—as Hayek ([1968] 2014) argues in another famous essay. Is it not also possible for cooperation to be a discovery procedure, as both developments in the area of software (keyword: open source) and classical large-scale military, scientific and industrial research suggest (cf., NR: 3193, Book ID: Society After Money Dialogue, Processed Text: likewis mean appar market competit function discoveri procedur anoth famou essay also possibl discoveri procedur develop area open sourc classic larg scale militari scientif industri research suggest
TEXT:  Allen and Potts 2016)? In fact, even if the original impulse for it comes from competition, the development of marketable products for the most part presupposes extensive cooperative processes: processes that are being expanded and fostered by the use of networked computer systems., NR: 3194, Book ID: Society After Money Dialogue, Processed Text: fact even origin impuls come competit develop market product part extens process process expand use comput system
TEXT:  This has led to the formation of a special area of research in so-called “computer-supported cooperative work” (cf. Schüttpelz and Gießmann 2015). It may be of interest to note here that, even if it is centered on the market, Hayek’s emphasis on self-organization was also an important influence on the Bloomington School, out of which, as is well known, Elinor Ostrom’s research grew (cf., NR: 3195, Book ID: Society After Money Dialogue, Processed Text: ha led format special area research comput work may interest note even center market emphasi self organ wa also import influenc school well known research grew
TEXT:  Horn 2013: 228). We can only allude to this aspect here, but in the preface to the German edition of her main work on the commons, in particular, Ostrom emphasizes the key role of communication for coordinating cooperation (cf., NR: 3196, Book ID: Society After Money Dialogue, Processed Text: horn allud aspect prefac german edit main work common particular key role commun
TEXT:  Ostrom 1999: xviii and passim). We can again ask whether the (at least in Western countries) nearly ubiquitous networking of mobile media does not provide a favorable infrastructural precondition for commons “beyond market and state,” as it is called in the subtitle of a well-known book (cf., NR: 3197, Book ID: Society After Money Dialogue, Processed Text: ask whether least western countri nearli ubiquit mobil medium doe provid favor precondit common beyond market state subtitl well known book
TEXT:  Helfrich and Heinrich-Böll-Stiftung 2012). (The German translation (Ostrom 1999) of Ostrom’s Governing the Commons has the same subtitle.) As far as we can see, Hayek’s approach of emphasizing decentralization and self-organization, as well as emphasizing situated and tacit knowledge and the need for discovery procedures, in no way excludes the possibility that there could be ways of organizing production, allocation and distribution other than the market and hence the exchanging of commodities for money., NR: 3198, Book ID: Society After Money Dialogue, Processed Text: boll german translat govern common ha subtitl far see approach self organ well situat tacit knowledg need discoveri procedur way possibl could way product alloc distribut market henc commod money

TEXT:  But the argument that, at least in principle, non-monetary decentralized coordination must also be possible has not only been attacked by neo-Hayekians like Lavoie and Hodgson. As has already been indicated, the whole discussion that has been conducted here can also be attacked from an emancipatory perspective: Is it not simply an attempt to create technical solutions to social problems? Is not the decisive point rather to replace—along with Marx—the organizational form of production that is coordinated ex post by directly communicative ex ante production: or, in other words, to replace the “isolated producers” by a kind of grassroots democratic collective production? Yes, that is the point: It is the only way to get rid of markets and money., NR: 3212, Book ID: Society After Money Dialogue, Processed Text: argument least principl non monetari must also possibl ha neo like ha alreadi whole discuss ha also emancipatori perspect simpli attempt creat technic solut social problem decis point rather replac along organiz form product post directli commun ant product word replac isol produc kind democrat collect product ye point way get rid market money

TEXT:  It is interesting to note that like Hayek—with the sole difference that Hayek does so precisely in a positive sense—the value-critical critic of capitalism, Robert Kurz, also illustrates the indirectness of market- and money-mediated communication using the example of the telephone., NR: 3215, Book ID: Society After Money Dialogue, Processed Text: interest note like sole differ doe precis posit sens valu critic critic capit also indirect market money commun exampl telephon
TEXT:  Kurz (1999: 785) writes that “the money form … is as crazy as if people who live in the same house were only permitted to communicate by satellite telephone.” It remains symptomatic in this example that Kurz mentions “people who live in the same house”: It is obvious that such people could communicate without a “satellite telephone” or, in other words, without indirect mediation., NR: 3216, Book ID: Society After Money Dialogue, Processed Text: money form crazi peopl live hous permit commun satellit telephon remain symptomat exampl mention peopl live hous obviou peopl could commun without satellit telephon word without indirect mediat
TEXT:  But the example remains trapped in the apparatus of a local household. Ex ante coordination among “people who live in the same house” is easy enough to imagine. But what about on the regional or global level? Here, “satellite telephones” (to stay with Kurz’s metaphor) are needed, whereas verbal communication, such as is implied by Kurz’s example, is impossible and pointless., NR: 3217, Book ID: Society After Money Dialogue, Processed Text: exampl remain trap apparatu local household ant among peopl live hous easi enough imagin region global level satellit telephon stay metaphor wherea verbal commun exampl imposs pointless

TEXT:  It connects up with a current discussion that asks what the medial coordinating mechanisms of a post-monetary society could look like. Also taking Hayek as his starting point, Nick Dyer-Witheford (2013: 12–13) has discussed such questions and different technical options at length in his outstanding essay “Red Plenty Platforms”: A society of participatory, informed, democratic and timely collective planning would require fast, varied and interactive communicative platforms where proposals could be circulated, responded to, at length or briefly, trends identified, reputations established, revisions and amendments generated, and so on., NR: 3226, Book ID: Society After Money Dialogue, Processed Text: current discuss medial mechan post monetari societi could look like also take start point nick dyer ha question differ technic option length outstand essay red plenti platform societi participatori inform democrat time collect would requir fast vari interact commun platform propos could length briefli trend reput establish revis amend

TEXT:  So we might speculate further, and suggest that what decentralized collective planning really needs is not just council media but communist agents: communist software agents.… Commercially, software “bidding agents” are able to consistently outperform human agents so that “Humans are on the verge of losing their status as the sole economic species on the planet” (Kephart …)., NR: 3229, Book ID: Society After Money Dialogue, Processed Text: might specul suggest collect realli need council medium communist agent communist agent commerci bid agent abl consist outperform human agent human verg lose statu sole econom speci planet

TEXT:  Other needs aim to increase a person’s well-being. Such needs are shaped by the respective culture in which a person lives.

TEXT: ” One feels the necessity to quell a pseudo-need. Instead of artificially generating such needs, we have to pose the question of what needs really exist. But how can this knowledge be acquired, when neither producers nor consumers can themselves name (to say nothing of predicting) what is needed? In what follows, we would like to pursue this question by examining the previously introduced thesis that tracking technologies, as well as self-tracking in particular, are able, as pervasive mobile media technologies, to feel out tacit knowledge and render it usable., NR: 3237, Book ID: Society After Money Dialogue, Processed Text: one feel necess quell pseudo need instead artifici gener need pose question need realli exist knowledg acquir neither produc consum name say noth would like pursu question examin previous thesi technolog well self particular abl pervas mobil medium technolog feel tacit knowledg render usabl
TEXT:  In order to get closer to an answer to the question, we want first to outline how “knowledge” can be obtained. The distinction between explicit and tacit knowledge is well-known. According to Ikujirō Nonaka and Hirotaka Takeuchi (1995: 8), “explicit knowledge can be expressed in words and numbers, and easily communicated and shared in the form of hard data, scientific formulae, codified procedures, or universal principles., NR: 3238, Book ID: Society After Money Dialogue, Processed Text: order get closer answer question want first outlin knowledg distinct explicit tacit knowledg well known accord explicit knowledg express word number easili form hard data scientif formula procedur univers principl

TEXT:  Nonaka and Takeuchi (1995: 8) distinguish here between two dimensions of tacit knowledge: [T]he technical dimension … encompasses the kind of informal and hard-to-pin-down skills or crafts captured in the term “know-how., NR: 3240, Book ID: Society After Money Dialogue, Processed Text: distinguish two dimens tacit knowledg technic dimens kind inform hard pin skill craft term know
TEXT: ” … At the same time, tacit knowledge contains an important cognitive dimension.

TEXT:  Tacit knowledge represents the larger part of knowledge as a whole. If it is to be made usable, it has to be converted into understandable words or codes.

TEXT:  Kabir and Carayannis 2013: 56), since tacit knowledge consists, after all, of information.

TEXT: ” By means of analogies or vivid language, an individual understanding could be made a shared one. The tacit knowledge thus becomes communicable and, to a certain degree, explicit.

TEXT:  Nonaka and Takeuchi 1995: 9, 12–13) Hayek too turned his attention to tacit knowledge: The peculiar character of the problems of a rational economic order is determined precisely by the fact that the knowledge of the circumstances of which we must make use never exists in concentrated or integrated form, but solely as the dispersed bits of incomplete and frequently contradictory knowledge which all the separate individuals possess., NR: 3246, Book ID: Society After Money Dialogue, Processed Text: turn attent tacit knowledg peculiar charact problem ration econom order determin precis fact knowledg circumst must make use never concentr form sole dispers bit incomplet frequent contradictori knowledg separ individu possess
TEXT:  The economic problem of society is thus not merely a problem of how to allocate “given” resources … it is a problem of the utilization of knowledge not given to anyone in its totality. Hayek [1945] 1948: 77–78; cited inNonaka and Takeuchi 1995: 33 Now, Nonaka and Takeuchi (1995) argue that Hayek overlooked the possibility of converting tacit and context-specific knowledge into explicit knowledge., NR: 3247, Book ID: Society After Money Dialogue, Processed Text: econom problem societi thu mere problem alloc given resourc problem util knowledg given anyon total argu possibl convert tacit context specif knowledg explicit knowledg
TEXT:  Contrary to his intentions, Hayek’s theory of the market is thus static and solely focuses on the efficient use of available knowledge. As discussed above, the question has to be posed of whether, as against Hayek’s view (as well as that of Hodgson (1998, 2005)), tacit knowledge of needs could not also become explicit., NR: 3248, Book ID: Society After Money Dialogue, Processed Text: contrari intent theori market thu static sole focu effici use avail knowledg question ha whether view well tacit knowledg need could also becom explicit
TEXT:  Thus, one step in finding out what should be produced consists in collecting implicit knowledge: As already mentioned, Big Data represents one possibility in this respect.

TEXT:  Every change in activity and every sort of gap can be detected by the use of self-tracking technologies, and it can be detected—thanks to the shortening of the feedback loop—without any loss of time: “Deviation and feedback are then simultaneous” (Schaupp 2016a: 70)., NR: 3272, Book ID: Society After Money Dialogue, Processed Text: everi chang activ everi sort gap use self technolog thank shorten feedback loop without loss time deviat feedback simultan
TEXT:  Immediate feedback is important for the optimization of a system. Simon Schaupp suggests/advocates using the concept of a homeostat for self-tracking. A homeostat has to have at least three elements: Firstly, a sensor, which gathers data on the system to be regulated; secondly, a data-processing or classification mechanism, which filters and structures the collected data in a way that allows it to become relevant to the functioning of the system (a mere mirroring of all the facts pertaining to the system would not represent any gain in information)., NR: 3273, Book ID: Society After Money Dialogue, Processed Text: immedi feedback import optim system advoc concept self ha least three element firstli sensor gather data system regul secondli data classif mechan filter structur collect data way becom relev system mere fact pertain system would repres gain inform
TEXT:  Thirdly, the homeostat has to have an output mechanism, which feeds the structured data back into the system. This feedback process is supposed to allow the system to adapt automatically to changing conditions: whether in order to maintain a desired state or to develop beyond it., NR: 3274, Book ID: Society After Money Dialogue, Processed Text: thirdli ha output mechan feed structur data back system feedback process suppos allow system adapt automat condit whether order maintain desir state develop beyond
TEXT:  Schaupp 2016a: 91–92 Schaupp shows very precisely that self-tracking technologies resemble the idea of homeostats. They too possess measurement sensors and help the “system” to achieve self-optimization via feedback., NR: 3275, Book ID: Society After Money Dialogue, Processed Text: show precis self technolog resembl idea possess measur sensor help system achiev self optim via feedback
TEXT:  If, now, the system is defined not as a single individual (as is often the case in self-tracking), but rather as a group, then this system too would be able to express its state in data, to make tacit knowledge usable, and to recognize how it can be optimized: to recognize, in other words, what it needs., NR: 3276, Book ID: Society After Money Dialogue, Processed Text: system defin singl individu often case self rather group system would abl express state data make tacit knowledg usabl recogn recogn word need
TEXT:  Tracking thus represents a conceivable option for a form of communication beyond price signals. In the article “Society’s Nervous System: Building Effective Government, Energy, and Public Health Systems” from 2012, Alex Pentland (MIT Human Dynamics Laboratory) asks what potential “pervasive sensing” and “mobile computing” will hold over the next ten years and what challenges are involved, or could be involved, in exploiting this potential (cf., NR: 3277, Book ID: Society After Money Dialogue, Processed Text: thu conceiv option form commun beyond price signal articl societi nervou system build effect govern energi public health system human dynam laboratori potenti pervas mobil hold next ten year challeng involv could involv potenti
TEXT:  Pentland 2012: 39). Right at the start, Pentland makes clear that current social structures do not use the possibilities of digital feedback technologies to the extent that one could, in order to be dynamic and responsive: “Instead of focusing only on access and distribution systems, we need dynamic, networked, self-regulating systems that take into account complex interactions., NR: 3278, Book ID: Society After Money Dialogue, Processed Text: right start make clear current social structur use possibl digit feedback technolog extent one could order dynam respons instead access distribut system need dynam self system take account complex interact
TEXT:  In short, to ensure a sustainable future society, we must use evolving technologies to create a nervous system for humanity that maintains the stability of government, energy, and public health systems around the globe” (Pentland 2012: 39)., NR: 3279, Book ID: Society After Money Dialogue, Processed Text: short ensur sustain futur societi must use technolog creat nervou system human stabil govern energi public health system around globe
TEXT:  In the further course of the article, he especially goes into smartphones as “location-aware sensor platforms” that can be used for self-tracking purposes: in order to understand patterns of human behavior, to monitor surroundings (for example, traffic and increased congestion), and to plan social development., NR: 3280, Book ID: Society After Money Dialogue, Processed Text: cours articl especi go locat awar sensor platform use self purpos order understand pattern human behavior monitor surround exampl traffic congest plan social develop
TEXT:  In order to solve the problem of privacy and control over the data, Pentland suggests introducing laws that grant individuals a constant right to their own data and the use thereof: 1.

TEXT: ” 2. You have the right to full control over the use of your data. The terms of use must be opt-in and clearly explained in plain language.

TEXT:  3. You have the right to dispose of or distribute your data. You have the option to destroy data about you or redeploy it elsewhere.

TEXT:  The possibilities mentioned here merely represent a suggestion. Both Pentland and Schaupp continue to discuss the technologies in connection with markets. As a “cybernetic self-technology,” Schaupp (2016b: 82) sees self-tracking as “in no way just an individual practice,” but rather the “expression of a political-economic shift,” which he describes as “cybernetic capitalism., NR: 3285, Book ID: Society After Money Dialogue, Processed Text: possibl mere repres suggest continu discu technolog connect market cybernet self technolog see self way individu practic rather express polit econom shift cybernet capit
TEXT: ” But in a society after money, the question of tracking technologies as part of capital accumulation no longer arises. If one’s own data is protected, and it is assured that it is only used to generate the information required for the production and distribution of goods, self-tracking offers everyone the opportunity of greater participation in the organization of their own living conditions., NR: 3286, Book ID: Society After Money Dialogue, Processed Text: societi money question technolog part capit accumul longer one data assur use gener inform product distribut good self offer everyon opportun greater particip organ live condit
TEXT:  This extends not only to the domains of existential and individual needs, but also to immaterial needs like, for example, health care, child care and elder care.

TEXT:  From an emancipatory perspective, it is often said that technical solutions cannot be substituted for social ones. It is important here to make clear that this criticism is correct to the degree that, for example, no technology, no matter how advanced, per se creates a post-capitalist form of organization., NR: 3292, Book ID: Society After Money Dialogue, Processed Text: emancipatori perspect often said technic solut cannot substitut social one import make clear critic correct degre exampl technolog matter advanc per post capitalist form organ
TEXT:  (A certain asymmetry is, however, to be observed in this regard: value-critical approaches, for instance, emphasize that there is no automatism that leads to an emancipated, post-capitalist society; but for value criticism, there is indeed an automatism that leads the competition-driven suppression of labor by new technologies up to the “inner limits” of capital., NR: 3293, Book ID: Society After Money Dialogue, Processed Text: certain asymmetri howev regard valu critic approach instanc emphas automat lead post capitalist societi valu critic inde automat lead competit driven suppress labor new technolog inner limit capit

TEXT:  As against Hayek’s conclusion that the preeminent role of situated and tacit knowledge makes central state planning, and indeed any sort of communicative planning, impossible, and the market, and hence exchange for money, indispensable, we could thus say that this conclusion fails to take into account that the indirect communication of situated and tacit knowledge—the possibility of which is, in principle, assumed by the price mechanism—could also take place without money under the conditions of computer networks and mobile sensors (smartphones)., NR: 3296, Book ID: Society After Money Dialogue, Processed Text: conclus role situat tacit knowledg make central state inde sort commun imposs market henc exchang money indispens could thu say conclus take account indirect commun situat tacit knowledg possibl principl assum price mechan could also take place without money condit comput network mobil sensor
TEXT:  Hayek’s emphasis on decentralization and self-organization is undoubtedly correct. But why should the money-centered market be the only or even the last and highest form of such organization? Hayek’s “evolutionary agnosticism,” as Vanberg (1994) once critically termed it, implies the possibility that the market and money are also only temporary forms, which will disappear again, perhaps in conflict with digital technologies, in the course of social evolution., NR: 3297, Book ID: Society After Money Dialogue, Processed Text: emphasi self organ undoubtedli correct money center market even last highest form organ evolutionari agnostic critic possibl market money also temporari form disappear perhap conflict digit technolog cours social evolut

TEXT:  Workers “and consumers/users” thoughts, feelings and conditions are jeopardized by capitalists’ narrow definition of efficiency based on the monetary costs of production. Although Heitmann’s “having much and doing little” money-free utopias and associated guaranteed unconditional minimum income schemes (as in Aufderheide-Kohl, Aigner and Scholz-Wäckerle, and Fleissner this volume) are popular, they float curiously above the material world, seemingly ignoring the urgency of natural regeneration and healing given the very real, and overstepped, limits to earth’s bounty., NR: 3417, Book ID: Society After Money Dialogue, Processed Text: worker consum user thought feel condit capitalist narrow definit effici base monetari cost product although much littl money free utopia associ uncondit minimum incom scheme kohl volum popular float curious materi world seemingli urgenc natur regener heal given real limit earth bounti

TEXT:  Indeed, while Marxist Fleissner (this volume) argues that commodities and money will be fatally disrupted by forthcoming technological developments, and Aufderheide-Kohl (this volume) sees “the collapse of monetary systems in all historical cycles merely a matter of time,” the irrationalities of monetary and financial spheres have attended the entire, triumphant history of capitalism., NR: 3422, Book ID: Society After Money Dialogue, Processed Text: inde volum commod money fatal forthcom technolog develop kohl volum see collaps monetari system histor cycl mere matter time irration monetari financi sphere entir triumphant histori capit
TEXT:  There are various questions for technological utopians. How do the “nuts and bolts” of automation fare as environmental costs? Who makes, monitors and fixes robots? Or, if they care and regenerate themselves, how do we relate to robots, and robots to us? Will our quests for direct democracy and autonomy result, instead, in the creation of an autonomous set of things or beings on which we depend for our existence? How will automation dissolve the Global North and Global South divide, and inequities more generally? How can automated work bear and bring up children who/which we might call “human”? Like Habermann (this volume) I am convinced that people, not technology, have the greatest potential to overthrow this system, which is—after all—of our own making., NR: 3423, Book ID: Society After Money Dialogue, Processed Text: variou question technolog utopian nut bolt fare environment cost make monitor fix robot care regener relat robot robot quest direct democraci autonomi result instead creation autonom set thing depend exist dissolv global north global south divid inequ gener work bear bring child might call human like volum convinc peopl technolog potenti overthrow system make
TEXT:  We need to decide on techniques and technologies that we think are appropriate even if as, say in my utopian sketch above, each locale opts for distinctly different types and combinations. Conclusion This output of the Society After Money project centered on the University of Bonn and funded by the Volkswagen Foundation has fruitfully drawn on scholars from a range of fields, such as heterodox economics, sociology, eco-feminism and commons, cultural, media, political and philosophical studies—to light a further fire in a very timely debate not only on the future of money but also of humanity., NR: 3424, Book ID: Society After Money Dialogue, Processed Text: need decid techniqu technolog think appropri even say utopian sketch local distinctli differ type combin conclus output societi money project center univers fund foundat ha fruit drawn scholar rang field heterodox econom sociolog femin common cultur medium polit philosoph studi light fire time debat futur money also human
