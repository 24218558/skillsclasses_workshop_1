TEXT:  As Tobias Aufderheide-Kohl shows in this volume, the dominant “neoclassical” school of economics (cf.

TEXT: 2 The hypothesis here is that humans have always produced and exchanged separately and privately—and money was only invented as a practical aid. Of course, today’s highly complex market economy presupposes the existence of money, and could probably not function without it—but have people really always produced separately and privately (what about guilds?), and does it have to stay this way forever, particularly at a time when general interconnectedness is on everyone’s lips?

TEXT:  This text offers a critical discussion of whether Hayek’s arguments are really still valid under current media conditions).

TEXT:  What is crucial here is the idea of replacing non-social production, which is isolated and then coordinated via the movement of things (monetary and commodity flows), with social production, which is ultimately communicative (and therefore coordinated with media that are alternatives to money), but not by means of state planning (it is no accident that the subtitle of the German translation of Ostrom’s book situates the commons “beyond market and state”)., LINE: 27, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: crucial idea non social product isol via movement thing monetari commod flow social product ultim commun therefor medium altern money mean state accid subtitl german translat book common beyond market state

TEXT:  Instead this is about overcoming exchange (and thus the market and money) by means of a form of production that is still individual, but is no longer merely partial, but omnipotent. What does this mean? Under market conditions, every producer must exchange in the market (especially those who can only sell their labor), since it is only possible, individually, to produce a certain, small portion of goods (the division of labor is often equated with the principle of exchange, although it would be entirely possible to imagine a division of labor arranged by democratic and communicative means)., LINE: 32, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: instead exchang thu market money mean form product still individu longer mere partial omnipot doe mean market condit everi produc must exchang market especi sell labor sinc possibl individu produc certain small portion good divis labor often principl exchang although would entir possibl imagin divis labor democrat commun mean
TEXT:  But if we had an “ideal machine of fabrication,” which really could produce anything we wanted, on the spot, then we would no longer need to exchange on markets, and would therefore no longer need money—as in the science fiction television series Star Trek: The Next Generation, where just such an ideal production machine, the Replicator, exists (see the chapter by Annette Schlemm in this volume)., LINE: 33, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: ideal machin fabric realli could produc anyth spot would longer need exchang market would therefor longer need money scienc fiction televis seri star trek next gener ideal product machin see chapter volum
TEXT:  Such a machine would virtually cancel out capitalism all on its own, but without requiring a new communicative form and infrastructure, i.e. a social ex ante organization (though it would give rise to new conflicts, for example over the ownership of the data needed for production—if these were to remain private property and scarce, then capitalism based on 3D printers would also be conceivable; the same goes for the necessary energy and raw materials)., LINE: 34, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: machin would virtual cancel capit without new commun form infrastructur social ant organ though would give rise new conflict exampl ownership data product remain privat properti scarc capit base printer would also conceiv go necessari energi raw materi
TEXT:  In this way a machine can overcome the existing form of society—seemingly by itself, and without the effort of political education, debate, struggle, and the reconstruction of subjectivity. This “technological imaginary” may well be the main reason for the popularity of post-capitalist utopias based on 3D printing., LINE: 35, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: way machin overcom form societi seemingli without effort polit educ debat struggl reconstruct subject technolog imaginari may well main reason popular post capitalist utopia base print
TEXT:  For example, Jeremy Rifkin (2014, 7–26) argues that the expansion of 3D printing (and of other technologies such as the “internet of things”) will inevitably lead to the expansion of the “collaborative commons,” and thus to a largely peaceful retreat of capitalism (see also the discussion of Rifkin in the text by Friederike Habermann)., LINE: 36, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: exampl expans print technolog thing inevit lead expans collabor common thu larg peac retreat capit see also discuss text

TEXT:  This is followed by a first part considering money in theoretical and historical terms. Various concepts are discussed (though inevitably not all of them, cf. Ingham 2005)—in particular a process highlighted and criticized by Marx: the naturalization of separate, private production, which makes money seem so indispensable (chapter by Lohoff from the perspective of the critique of value)., LINE: 39, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: first part consid money theoret histor term variou concept though inevit particular process natur separ privat product make money seem indispens chapter perspect critiqu valu

TEXT:  On the other hand, we would then have to ask, self-critically, whether a post-monetary society would not also be a society without obligations—which initially seems difficult to imagine (though the chapter by Stefan Meretz examines this point and outlines an alternative)., LINE: 41, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: hand would ask self critic whether post monetari societi would also societi without oblig initi difficult imagin though chapter point outlin altern
TEXT:  This is followed by a “trialogue,” that is, a deliberately multiperspectival discussion exploring whether money is to be defined as a commodity or as a medium. This question is relevant because it leads to the bigger question of whether and to what extent money can be made superfluous not only by other forms of organization, but perhaps also by alternative technological developments., LINE: 42, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: trialogu deliber discuss explor whether money defin commod medium question relev lead bigger question whether extent money made superflu form organ perhap also altern technolog develop

TEXT:  The chapter by Aigner and Scholz-Wäckerle, which concludes the section on money, examines this technological/institutional nexus of money, with reference to the current debate.

TEXT:  Stefan Meretz then takes up the debate about the commons (cf. Ostrom 2009), examining in detail possible categorial conditions for a commons-based, post-monetary form of production. Next, Friederike Habermann also discusses commons-based peer production, but pays particular attention to the problem of gender asymmetries linked to the relationship between production and re-production (or care)., LINE: 48, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: take debat common examin detail possibl categori condit common base post monetari form product next also common base peer product pay particular attent problem gender asymmetri link relationship product product care

TEXT:  He also discusses studies on new models of economic planning, which build on new computer technologies, promising to make markets—and thus, in principle, money—obsolete. The role of new computer technologies is at the center of the whole last part, which explores the hypothesis that these technological changes do not lead, deterministically, to other and “better,” “post-monetary” conditions, but that they at least shake up the existing conditions (see the endless excited discourses on “Industry 4., LINE: 52, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: also studi new model econom build new comput technolog promis make market thu principl money obsolet role new comput technolog center whole last part hypothesi technolog chang lead better post monetari condit least shake condit see endless excit discours industri

TEXT:  The last chapter in this part revisits the “socialist calculation debate” of the 1920s and 1930s, and, reading certain key texts by Friedrich von Hayek in the light of media theory, Jasmin Kathöfer and Jens Schröter discuss whether the problem of knowledge he outlines—which has been seen as a decisive argument against, at least, central planning—is still valid under the conditions of mobile, distributed, trace-forming media, or whether the accumulation of information might instead constitute the basis for decentralized planning (beyond the market and the state, and thus able to be meaningfully linked with the commons debate from Part 2)., LINE: 54, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: last chapter part socialist calcul debat read certain key text light medium theori discu whether problem knowledg outlin ha seen decis argument least central still valid condit mobil distribut trace form medium whether accumul inform might instead constitut basi beyond market state thu abl meaning link common debat part

TEXT:  Money does not grow on trees, it is not something natural, it has a beginning, and can perhaps also have an end, or at least change its form.

TEXT:  This crisis-prone nature is demonstrated on the one hand by objective facts such as rates of economic growth, or shifts in the relationship between economic and political institutions, discernible from the constant pumping of fresh money into the markets by many central banks, or more generally, from the power of the economy in relation to the political sphere (and thus “society”)., LINE: 76, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: crisi prone natur one hand object fact rate econom growth shift relationship econom polit institut discern constant fresh money market mani central bank gener power economi relat polit sphere thu societi

TEXT: 2 These objective facts and subjective perceptions have given rise to widespread debates about the direction in which society (that is, the economy) should develop in the future. These debates prove, on closer inspection, to be extremely diverse: while on the one hand there is discussion of familiar right-wing, liberal or social-democratic approaches (which all see reform of the existing monetary system as the solution), on the other hand there are approaches that aim at different ways of generating and using money (e., LINE: 79, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: object fact subject percept given rise widespread debat direct societi economi develop futur debat prove closer inspect extrem divers one hand discuss familiar right wing liber social democrat approach see reform monetari system solut hand approach aim differ way gener money

TEXT:  The spectrum of approaches to post-monetary economic activity currently up for discussion proves to be extremely diverse: we find a wide range of approaches such as attempts by individuals or small groups to live without money, based on notions of the “free economy”5 or “self-sufficiency,” and thus linked with very varied concepts of production; anonymized urban “free economies” (of production as well as distribution and use); global “virtual,” “networked” “free economies”; small-scale “subsistence” lifestyles, here again associated with widely differing concepts of production; a “high-tech planned economy” conceived in global terms, leaning toward either democracy or a highly centralized expertocracy or technocracy; technology-oriented “free economies” with highly decentralized but globally integrated concepts of reproduction, and more., LINE: 83, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: spectrum approach post monetari econom activ current discuss prof extrem divers find wide rang approach attempt individu small group live without money base notion free economi self suffici thu link vari concept product urban free economi product well distribut use global virtual free economi small scale subsist associ wide concept product high tech economi global term lean toward either democraci highli technocraci technolog free economi highli global concept reproduct

TEXT:  David Graeber 1.1 Money as a Special Form of Economy In economics and sociology, universalist statements have often been made about the economic life of humans: general assumptions about the rationality of economic behavior (Homo oeconomicus), and assumptions about general forms of economic practice (exchange), and structural or functional principles of the economy (the division of labor, “economy as the communication of scarcity,” or the “adaptation of society to the environment”)., LINE: 96, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: money special form economi econom sociolog universalist statement often made econom life human gener assumpt ration econom behavior homo assumpt gener form econom practic exchang structur function principl economi divis labor economi commun scarciti adapt societi environ
TEXT:  Such universalizations always suggest that economic attitudes and forms of organization which are dominant today are completely “normal,” or even “natural”—and therefore that things cannot actually be different from what they are., LINE: 97, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: alway suggest econom attitud form organ domin today complet normal even natur therefor thing cannot actual differ
TEXT:  Yet such universalizations have been criticized and refuted in various ways in contemporary research, thus raising the possibility that things could be completely different, that people could follow totally different orientations in the reproduction of their lives, and could organize themselves quite differently from the way they do today., LINE: 98, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: yet variou way contemporari research thu rais possibl thing could complet differ peopl could follow total differ orient reproduct life could organ quit differ way today
TEXT: 7 This also applies to money, a central phenomenon in today’s economy, and to the academic study of this phenomenon. These have also been increasingly subjected to critical research, and the critical examination of money has given rise to critical perspectives on the above-mentioned general assumptions about the rationality, organization, and structure of economic activity., LINE: 99, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: also money central phenomenon today economi academ studi phenomenon also increasingli subject critic research critic examin money ha given rise critic perspect gener assumpt ration organ structur econom activ
TEXT:  For example, it was a long-held belief that money had its origins in the exchange of goods for goods, as a way of simplifying this, and that humans had a “natural propensity” for exchange. Today this belief is increasingly being called into question: •Today there are a large number of studies with a focus on economic history which show that money did not develop, historically, from barter, but was constituted under specific social, cultural and psychological conditions as a relation of obligation., LINE: 100, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: exampl wa long belief money origin exchang good good way human natur propens exchang today belief increasingli question today larg number studi focu econom histori show money develop histor barter wa specif social cultur psycholog condit relat oblig
TEXT: 8 Thus money cannot simply be regarded as a “medium” with equalizing or otherwise emancipatory effects, as is often still the case; instead its institutionalization and generalization are always associated with constellations of domination and dependency., LINE: 101, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: thu money cannot simpli medium equal otherwis emancipatori effect often still case instead gener alway associ constel domin depend
TEXT:  •The historically oriented explanations for money and other relevant research on economic history also make it clear that the use of money, especially in its present ubiquitous form, is not a constant of human history; on the contrary, if we look back on the (currently accepted) 160,000 years of development of Homo sapiens, it is a historically recent phenomenon., LINE: 102, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: histor explan money relev research econom histori also make clear use money especi present ubiquit form constant human histori contrari look back current accept year develop homo histor recent phenomenon
TEXT:  The development of money can be roughly outlined as follows.9 Before the emergence of coined money from about 800 BC, various forms of non-monetary exchange existed: ritual exchange, barter, and primitive money or commodity money (these last since the Neolithic period, from about 6000 BC)., LINE: 103, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: develop money roughli outlin emerg money variou form non monetari exchang ritual exchang barter primit money commod money last sinc neolith period
TEXT: 10 In some cases, diverse and extensive relations of exchange did develop in connection with these forms of exchange, but in societies where these forms of exchange occurred, exchange remained, overall, a fairly marginal phenomenon with regard to the reproduction of people or collectives., LINE: 104, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: case divers extens relat exchang develop connect form exchang societi form exchang exchang overal fairli margin phenomenon regard reproduct peopl collect
TEXT:  Or at least: things were not (primarily) produced for exchange, but subsistence remained the basis of these societies. Thus even high cultures that did not yet use coined money generally developed complex relations of exchange, but these were ultimately based on subsistence, contributions in kind, and personal relations of exploitation., LINE: 105, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: least thing primarili produc exchang subsist basi societi thu even high cultur yet use money gener complex relat exchang ultim base subsist contribut kind person relat exploit
TEXT:  Even societies which developed coined money and extensive trade relations (China, Lydia/Greece, Rome) only used this money to a limited extent. Here too, the basis was still subsistence, and most people remained peasants and/or slaves., LINE: 106, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: even societi money extens trade relat china use money limit extent basi wa still subsist peopl peasant slave
TEXT:  With the end of the Roman Empire and the development of the feudal system in Europe, the use of money actually declined, and only gradually expanded again in the course of the Middle Ages.11 Only from the sixteenth century onwards, with the transformation of labor and land into commodities, did extensive money-based economic contexts develop (“capitalism”)., LINE: 107, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: end empir develop feudal system use money actual declin gradual expand cours middl age sixteenth centuri onward transform labor land commod extens money base econom context develop capit
TEXT:  This shows that, historically, the extensive use of money is a very recent phenomenon. The distinctive nature of the money used in this context, however, can be explored not only in historical but also in structural terms., LINE: 108, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: show histor extens use money recent phenomenon distinct natur money use context howev histor also structur term
TEXT:  In social science research on money, for example, the structural difference between pre-capitalist and capitalist money becomes apparent in various ways. •From the perspective of a Marxist critique of political economy, it becomes clear that today’s money, in contrast to all other historically existing forms of money, is not only “obligation” or “debt,” but is always already capital, and that the use of money only occurs in connection with the historically specific social power relation that underlies this use: the exploitation of working non-owners by non-working owners, on the basis of free contracts between formally equal legal entities., LINE: 109, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: social scienc research money exampl structur differ capitalist capitalist money becom appar variou way perspect critiqu polit economi becom clear today money contrast histor form money oblig debt alway alreadi capit use money connect histor specif social power relat use exploit work non owner non work owner basi free contract formal equal legal entiti
TEXT: 12 Here work and production no longer take place for the immediate satisfaction of needs, but for exchange, that is, for purposes of buying or selling. Whether or not they take place depends on whether the purpose of pecuniary gain is fulfilled, and ultimately on whether the sum of money invested as capital becomes more money., LINE: 110, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: work product longer take place immedi satisfact need exchang purpos sell whether take place whether purpos pecuniari gain ultim whether sum money capit becom money
TEXT:  Here money always embodies this underlying production relationship, and the structural social relationship of economic value which it creates. It should be stressed here that it is only under the condition of this specific power relation that money first ceases to play a merely secondary role in the satisfaction of needs, and that the acquisition of money becomes the universal prerequisite for life (Polanyi 2001)., LINE: 111, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: money alway underli product relationship structur social relationship econom valu condit specif power relat money first ceas play mere secondari role satisfact need acquisit money becom univers prerequisit life
TEXT:  It is only now that the economy develops as an overall context in which all individuals relate to each other (via the universal principle of private property, the global division of labor, and universally comparable prices)., LINE: 112, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: economi overal context individu relat via univers principl privat properti global divis labor univers compar price
TEXT: 13 And it is only now that people can and must behave in a thoroughly selfish and calculated way toward each other. •One aspect of (modern) money, defined as capital, is that acts of exchange take place as elements of an overall system of interlocking circulations of capital (Pahl 2008: 15f., LINE: 113, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: peopl must behav thoroughli selfish calcul way toward one aspect modern money defin capit act exchang take place element overal system circul capit
TEXT: , 152). This includes a functional relationship between different forms of capital, with credit as a central component of the system as a whole. Given society’s focus on the acquisition of money, and the linking of this acquisition to the generation of profit, credit inevitably develops into a core element of the functional context of capitalism (Heinrich 2003), even if it is only for fundamental investments or those made for reasons of competition, which cannot be financed from available funds or purely from profits., LINE: 114, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: function relationship differ form capit credit central compon system whole given societi focu acquisit money link acquisit gener profit credit inevit core element function context capit even fundament invest made reason competit cannot avail fund pure profit
TEXT:  •Another aspect of the special, structural power relation arising from this is that “economics” develops an independent existence as a socially objective functional context with its own “dynamics.” The “anarchy of commodity production” (Friedrich Engels) emerging with the development of capitalism brings with it objective monetary phenomena such as inflation, specific growth parameters and crises, phenomena that are not deliberately created by anyone, but are the precondition for all economic actions, and are in turn a reflection of capital’s new, independent existence as an “automatic subject” (Marx)., LINE: 115, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: anoth aspect special structur power relat econom independ exist social object function context dynam anarchi commod product develop capit object monetari phenomenon inflat specif growth paramet crisi phenomenon deliber anyon precondit econom action turn reflect capit new independ exist automat subject
TEXT: 14 This increasing independence is reproduced in and through action.15 •At the same time, this new independent existence of the economic has a specific societal dimension, which is often identified in sociology, and which constitutes a further specific social quality of capitalist society: the economy not only becomes independent in itself, that is, in the form of unintended dynamics resulting from the intentional economic actions of individuals, but at the same time it becomes independent of (or in sociological/functional terms: “differentiated” from) “society” (Habermas 1987; Polanyi 2001)., LINE: 116, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: increas independ action time new independ exist econom ha specif societ dimens often sociolog specif social qualiti capitalist societi economi becom independ form unintend dynam result intent econom action individu time becom independ sociolog function term societi
TEXT:  •This historical process by which the economy acquires independence or is differentiated from society proves to have weighty consequences: with the “institutionalization of the medium of money” (Habermas) and the associated differentiation between the economy and society, society as a whole is “flying blind” in both economic and socio-cultural terms., LINE: 117, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: histor process economi independ societi prof weighti consequ medium money associ differenti economi societi societi whole fli blind econom cultur term
TEXT: 16 Not only does the (systemic) development of the economy determine the economic and political options; the development of social norms and individual identities also ultimately remains bound to the “valorization of value., LINE: 118, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: doe system develop economi determin econom polit option develop social norm individu ident also ultim remain bound valor valu
TEXT: ”17 This “valorization of value” leads, as history has shown, to the often demonstrated dynamics of “marketization” (Ökonomisierung), to the huge ecological, economic, social and individual dislocations that go with it, and so, finally, to the question of possible alternatives., LINE: 119, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: valor valu lead histori ha shown often dynam huge ecolog econom social individu disloc final question possibl altern
TEXT: 18 Capitalist money thus proves to be not only a historically distinct phenomenon, but also a core component of a qualitatively new form of social coexistence. With these insights into the historical and qualitatively new character of money, the question of economic alternatives—a key question for movements critical of capitalism—now presents itself in a specific way: on the one hand, the insight into the historical characteristics of money opens our eyes to many other possible uses and forms of money., LINE: 120, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: capitalist money thu prof histor distinct phenomenon also core compon qualit new form social coexist insight histor qualit new charact money question econom altern key question movement critic capit present specif way one hand insight histor characterist money open eye mani possibl us form money
TEXT:  On the other hand, the structure-oriented perspective on money allows a critical examination of reformist approaches to growth and money (in particular, the reformist ideas focused on ecology and a critique of growth which are prominent today), approaches based on a critique of interest, and approaches aiming at the abolition of deposit money creation., LINE: 121, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: hand structur perspect money critic examin reformist approach growth money particular reformist idea ecolog critiqu growth promin today approach base critiqu interest approach aim abolit deposit money creation
TEXT:  All these approaches retain the idea of money as a general means of exchange, and face, each in their own specific way, a virtually insoluble problem.19 A few key objections (out of many more) are summarized here: •Growth cannot be simply slowed down, let alone stopped: either the economy grows or it shrinks chaotically., LINE: 122, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: approach retain idea money gener mean exchang face specif way virtual insolubl problem key object mani growth cannot simpli let alon stop either economi shrink chaotic
TEXT: 20 •Interest proves to be an essential element if money is to function as a general means of exchange: no interest → no profit → no exchange.21 •In itself, the containment or abolition of deposit money does nothing to change the function of money as capital, and can therefore do little to prevent crises (and inequality)., LINE: 123, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: interest prof essenti element money function gener mean exchang interest profit exchang contain abolit deposit money doe noth chang function money capit therefor littl prevent crisi inequ
TEXT: 22 If we assume that the objections to reformist ideas are justified, then it seems plausible at present to consider a de-monetarization of the economy rather than reforms of the growth model or of the use of money., LINE: 124, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: assum object reformist idea plausibl present consid economi rather reform growth model use money
TEXT:  But in light of the diverse ways of life that exist in today’s developed capitalism, this leads to a further question: What could a de-monetarized, i.e. a post-monetary economy be like? What forms of coordination and social organization can be imagined, under present-day conditions, if money ceases to exist or is reduced to a minor role? Before we turn to the possible answers that are given to this question, I think we first need to consider another aspect of the distinctiveness or limitations of money as a form of economic practice: the “blind flight” described above, driven by monetary considerations and organized along monetary lines, and unique in the history of humanity, must not hide the fact (as often happens in economics and the social sciences) that the imposition and perpetuation of the newly independent “system” has always been attended by a number of non-monetary practices., LINE: 125, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: light divers way life exist today capit lead question could post monetari economi like form social organ present day condit money ceas exist reduc minor role turn possibl answer given question think first need consid anoth aspect distinct limit money form econom practic blind flight driven monetari consider organ along monetari line uniqu histori human must hide fact often econom social scienc imposit perpetu newli independ system ha alway number non monetari practic

TEXT:  This is something we need to explore in greater detail when considering the possible make-up of a post-monetary economy. 1.3 “Subsistence”: A Different “Social Logic”? The “logic” of thought, action and feeling within the context of capitalist reproduction can be discerned in various forms of social relationship and individual orientations: in competitive relationships and strategic attitudes toward other people, in a focus on abstract values (money), in the ideologies and practices of dominion over nature, in the subordination of thought, action and feeling to general “constraints” (often including the experience of powerlessness), and in an indifference toward the economic, ecological, social and sometimes even individual consequences of personal or collective action—going as far as the willingness to use pure force (violent appropriation of spaces and resources, enslavement, war) to achieve one’s goals., LINE: 156, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: someth need explor greater detail consid possibl make post monetari economi subsist differ social logic logic thought action feel within context capitalist reproduct variou form social relationship individu orient competit relationship strateg attitud toward peopl focu abstract valu money ideolog practic dominion natur subordin thought action feel gener constraint often experi powerless indiffer toward econom ecolog social sometim even individu consequ person collect action go far willing use pure forc violent appropri space resourc enslav war achiev one goal

TEXT:  With regard to their social “logic,” these approaches (those where several people are jointly “self-sufficient”) often involve little reflection: established patriarchal identities (which in some cases have already been overcome in emancipatory social movements) and the associated forms of division of labor and decision-making are uncritically adopted., LINE: 203, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: regard social logic approach sever peopl jointli self suffici often involv littl reflect establish patriarch ident case alreadi overcom emancipatori social movement associ form divis labor decis make uncrit adopt

TEXT:  In their view, any form of “high culture” is associated with the emergence of domination: according to this theory, the development of the division of labor during the establishment of arable farming and animal husbandry led to the rise of patriarchal, political, economic, and all other social and cultural forms of domination., LINE: 205, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: view form high cultur associ emerg domin accord theori develop divis labor establish arabl farm anim husbandri led rise patriarch polit econom social cultur form domin
TEXT:  The “industrial society,” finally, constitutes the highest form of the development of dominion over humans and nature.

TEXT:  Politics, ‘the art and science of government,’ is not part of the primitivist project; only a politics of desire, pleasure, mutuality and radical freedom” (Moore [n.d.]).

TEXT: ” Indigenous cultures serve as points of orientation and sources of inspiration, but the notions of future “simple living” go beyond this. At the same time, marked differences can be observed between different proponents: while some see “permaculture” as a good (and practicable) solution, others think (self-)sufficiency should be achieved by hunting and gathering., LINE: 211, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: indigen cultur serv point orient sourc inspir notion futur simpl live beyond time mark differ differ propon see good practic solut think self suffici hunt gather
TEXT:  While some want to hunt and kill animals, others advocate vegetarianism or even veganism.

TEXT:  Sometimes there are substantial differences between these approaches, as in the case of the “Krishna Valley” (1) and “Twin Oaks” (2) communes.

TEXT:  On the lower levels, this organizational structure does not envisage any forms of democratic participation; the only avenue available is to make petitions to the upper levels on a given subject. Democratic elements are only found on the higher levels of the hierarchy, which are in turn embedded in organizational contexts that go beyond the “commune” itself: Management of Krishna-valley is controlled by a board of directors, from which each member is responsible for one directorate controlling a certain aspect of life., LINE: 224, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: lower level organiz structur doe envisag form democrat particip avenu avail make petit upper level given subject democrat element found higher level hierarchi turn organiz context beyond commun manag valley board director member respons one director certain aspect life

TEXT:  This makes it transparent what I am doing. And the “quota,” as the required volume of work is called, is quickly reached in this model. Roth 2011 “Labor sheets” are a core element of the “economy” in this “labor credit system”; “managers” use these to try to reconcile members’ wishes regarding activities and working hours with the tasks that need to be carried out: Each week, every member fills in a labor sheet setting out what work they want to do for the following week., LINE: 240, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: make transpar quota volum work quickli model labor sheet core element economi labor credit system manag use tri reconcil member wish regard activ work hour task need carri week everi member fill labor sheet set work want follow week

TEXT:  Dealing with the “labor sheets” is part of a “planner-manager system,” which not only allocates tasks, but also makes decisions about what is produced and in what quantity. This system of organization is not democratic in the sense of “grassroots democracy,” but instead follows the model of a “flat hierarchy,” and displays a clear structure: Basically, the community has a kind of participatory, rotating system of self-government, in which every decision is made by individuals or small groups on behalf of the larger group., LINE: 243, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: deal labor sheet part planner manag system task also make decis produc quantiti system organ democrat sens democraci instead model flat hierarchi display clear structur basic commun ha kind participatori rotat system self govern everi decis made individu small group behalf group

TEXT:  It is planners and managers who make decisions in Twin Oaks. While these terms are normally associated with positions of power, in this project they are job descriptions that can be taken literally.

TEXT:  Worker/consumer participation in production covers both the individual production facility and macroeconomic planning.

TEXT:  An important element of planning is the “Iteration Facilitation Board” (IFB), a working group which, during the decision-making process, constantly presents the “costs”: the resources, time, and effort required for activities, the effect that producing one thing will have on the opportunity to produce something else (“opportunity costs”)., LINE: 273, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: import element iter facilit board work group decis make process constantli present cost resourc time effort activ effect one thing opportun produc someth els opportun cost
TEXT:  Like other alternative approaches, the “parecon” approach makes the basic assumption that a multitude of activities that are necessary today will no longer be relevant in a post-capitalist society. In general, activities that should be mentioned in this context are arms/defense, administration/the executive, the finance industry, advertising, expenses for the management of crises/“externalities,” and elaborate infrastructure for globalized production, which in some cases proves to be ecologically unacceptable., LINE: 274, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: like altern approach approach make basic assumpt multitud activ necessari today longer relev post capitalist societi gener activ context arm defens administr execut financ industri advertis expens manag crisi extern elabor infrastructur product case prof ecolog unaccept

TEXT: 65 Despite these normative and practical objections (which not only apply to the “parecon” model in particular, but also to approaches to democracy based on workers’ councils and those of “inclusive democracy”), the argument often made against radical approaches to democracy and those based on workers’ councils—that larger social structures are in principle not possible without state organization—can be refuted in the light of relevant research on contemporary stateless societies (mainly in Africa and South-East Asia)., LINE: 288, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: despit norm practic object appli model particular also approach democraci base worker council inclus democraci argument often made radic approach democraci base worker council social structur principl possibl without state organ light relev research contemporari stateless societi mainli south east

TEXT:  Such approaches differ, sometimes quite markedly, when it comes to how a society’s production should be planned, and how the results of the production process should be distributed.

TEXT:  Thus capitalist society, with its focus on work and consumption, is “sublated,” as it were, into a planning-based “system.” The idea is that “wealth” will then be better (and more fairly) distributed, and production will be “more efficient,” “more sustainable,” and above all more democratic., LINE: 295, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: thu capitalist societi focu work consumpt base system idea wealth better fairli distribut product effici sustain democrat

TEXT:  Democratic decisions must be made about their distribution. The combination of the two mechanisms would allow an economy to react very fast.

Moreover, it is uncertain to what extent the approach can do justice to its own aspiration to greater democratization: the principle of majority rule is still in force, the danger of “burocratization” still exists, and the approach still conceives of a global system, based on the division of labor and the intensive use of resources, which raises questions about the possibility of other ways of life than “cybersocialism., LINE: 311, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: capitalist ration exchang equival also remain place moreov uncertain extent approach justic aspir greater democrat principl major rule still forc danger still approach still global system base divis labor intens use resourc rais question possibl way life

TEXT:  Schäfer and Winter 2010: 13f. In this “system,” the “experts” strive for complete automation of the production process.

From this perspective, religion—which merely speaks of a better world—is replaced by a “functional spirituality,” which now becomes a practical reality: When it comes to notions of caring people who work together in mutual respect and harmony, a resource-based economy puts into practice everything that the great religious and philosophical teachers have always talked about since the beginning of time., LINE: 322, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: serf polem counterweight attitud particular religi conscious perspect religion mere better world function spiritu becom practic realiti come notion peopl work togeth mutual respect harmoni resourc base economi put practic everyth great religi philosoph teacher alway sinc begin time

From the point of view of today’s science the opposite must be assumed: that science and technology are always already embedded in society (and therefore political), and that therefore what we need to find are social processes for organizing “resources” and activities, and, linked with this, determining how and to what extent technology is to be used., LINE: 327, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: even specif technolog solut technolog defin problem basi current state scienc polit point view today scienc opposit must assum scienc technolog alway alreadi societi therefor polit therefor need find social process resourc activ link extent technolog use

Is it conceivable that “resources” might be removed from the grasp of industry and made available for other forms of production? What about indigenous people, who (if they are asked) often do not want to participate in the industrial system? And finally, what if, in a “free” and “knowledge-oriented” society, processes of reflection take place which lead to other needs, not only “material,” but also social? What if, for example, many people wanted to produce in a manner that was self-organized, in harmony with nature, and did not involve any exchange? What if they even found ways in which this was possible for everybody? Would the industrial system be capable of transforming itself to meet the changed needs of the (many) people? For another thing, and connected to the above: in view of the “path dependencies” that come with industrial technology, how do these approaches deal with technological “progress,” in the sense of the emergence of “more efficient”/“more sustainable,” and usually non-industrial technologies (keywords: “fabbing,” “permaculture,” “cob building,” “alternative medicine”)?

Quoted in Habermann 2009: 203 This “do-ocracy” can be understood as a form of “social self-organization” which ultimately differs from the idea of “democracy”: “A do-ocracy … is an organizational structure in which individuals choose roles and tasks for themselves and execute them., LINE: 346, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: volunt thing ocraci understood form social self organ ultim idea democraci ocraci organiz structur individu choos role task execut

TEXT:  The idea is then to use this form of organization generally for the organization of production and distribution.88 6.“Commoning” in the framework of “peer-economy networks” allows (last but not least) a different technology in comparison to the “grassroots approach” and to centralist and large-scale approaches: “commoning” is, in principle, technologically open., LINE: 408, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: idea use form organ gener organ product distribut framework peer economi network last least differ technolog comparison approach centralist larg scale approach principl technolog open
TEXT:  The aspiration to a consistent focus on needs gives rise to a single criterion, that the technology must be “adapted,” but this allows a multitude of concrete forms of technology. So it is not a matter of contrasting specific methods, such as “permaculture,” automatic machines and computers, or “fabbers”; instead it is about what people want within the framework of a needs-oriented form of production, and what technologies they create in “commoning., LINE: 409, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: aspir consist focu need give rise singl criterion technolog must multitud concret form technolog matter specif method automat machin comput instead peopl want within framework need form product technolog creat

TEXT: ) Overall, then, we can retain a few key points which set these approaches apart from all the others presented so far: •Cooperation on a voluntary basis •Action based on “intrinsic motivation” (interest in a thing, the natural or “self-evident” human tendency to look after others) •Trust, as manifested in the uncoupling of giving and taking •Trust in people’s ability to cooperate or resolve conflicts while acknowledging their differences •Openness with regard to needs, organizational processes and technologies., LINE: 411, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: overal retain key point set approach apart far voluntari basi action base intrins motiv interest thing natur self evid human tendenc look trust manifest give take trust peopl abil resolv conflict differ open regard need organiz process technolog
TEXT:  Despite its fundamental appeal, and the fact that it “works” in various respects, the approach is (still) likely to cause a certain unease from the present-day viewpoint.

TEXT:  Adorno The preceding remarks have shown that there are currently a large number of different theoretical and practical approaches to post-monetary life.

TEXT: 91 In contrast, “subsistence” (in a wide range of forms), “free economy,” open-source software, “free culture” and so on show that things can be done differently.

TEXT:  The discussion has thus made it very clear that today we no longer have to ask whether moneyless economic activity is possible, but whether it will happen, and if so how and when. With regard to the existing approaches, one fundamental observation to be made is that all of these are literally only approaches: they are first attempts, and not by any means complete “solutions,” since they always take place from within capitalism, and are therefore still influenced by it in various ways., LINE: 420, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: discuss ha thu made clear today longer ask whether moneyless econom activ possibl whether happen regard approach one fundament observ made liter approach first attempt mean complet solut sinc alway take place within capit therefor still variou way

TEXT:  Answering these questions will be an essential part of the journey toward a “society after money.”93 It will have to become clear whether a “society after money” (i.e. after money as capital) will be a society without any means of exchange., LINE: 425, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: question essenti part journey toward societi money becom clear whether societi money money capit societi without mean exchang
TEXT:  Whatever concrete shape a possible “society after money” will take, it is plain that all the approaches in this direction have always been transformatory movements on contested social terrain. Various lines of conflict can be discerned here: •An economic line of conflict runs between the formation and development of “solidarity-based economies” and their appropriation for new strategies of valorization, or between a non-commercial “economy of sharing” and a commercialized “sharing economy” (Metzger 2015; Lobo 2014)., LINE: 426, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: whatev concret shape possibl societi money take plain approach direct alway movement social terrain variou line conflict econom line conflict run format develop solidar base economi appropri new strategi valor non commerci economi economi lobo
TEXT:  Another key area of conflict is the “capitalist permeation of reproduction” (Bauhardt 2012: 7), i.e. the progressive emergence of “care capitalism.” Here the development and implementation of a “different logic” of reproduction is, from a feminist perspective, an attempt to overcome not only economic “exploitation,” but also patriarchal forms of domination (Fraser 2017: 100)., LINE: 427, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: anoth key area conflict capitalist permeat reproduct progress emerg care capit develop implement differ logic reproduct feminist perspect attempt overcom econom exploit also patriarch form domin
TEXT:  •Politically, the conflict is about defending forms of “solidarity-based economy” against the current policies of growth, which are generally held up as being the only possible option. This is about combatting labor-market policies focused solely on integrating people into paid work, containing the progressive “marketization” of resources, cultures and identities, and fighting for the freedom to develop social “testing grounds” (Helfrich and Bollier 2015)., LINE: 428, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: polit conflict form solidar base economi current polici growth gener possibl option labor market polici sole peopl work progress resourc cultur ident fight freedom develop social test ground
TEXT: 94 An essential prerequisite for this is finding a solution to the fundamental economic policy dilemma of present-day politics: parliamentary politics will only be able to support alternative/moneyless economies to a very limited extent, as long as it is primarily obliged to support “growth” as the foundation for its own capacity to act—on the basis of a capitalist economic order which it has institutionalized., LINE: 429, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: essenti prerequisit find solut fundament econom polici dilemma present day polit parliamentari polit abl support altern moneyless economi limit extent long primarili oblig support growth foundat capac act basi capitalist econom order ha
TEXT:  At the same time, this “growth” generates an ever greater subjective and objective need for post-capitalist, alternative/moneyless economic methods. To escape from the “growth spiral” (Binswanger), then, we would need concrete economic policy strategies of orderly contraction., LINE: 430, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: time growth ever greater subject object need post capitalist altern moneyless econom method escap growth spiral would need concret econom polici strategi orderli contract
TEXT:  These, however, do not yet exist (Herrmann 2015b).95 •Another essential prerequisite for any increase in social emancipation is the development of pluralist “civil society” cultures. This means that in social and cultural respects, the conflict is about securing recognition for different ways of life in practical and theoretical contexts, against the spread of exclusionary and discriminatory attitudes., LINE: 431, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: howev yet exist anoth essenti prerequisit increas social emancip develop pluralist civil societi cultur mean social cultur respect conflict recognit differ way life practic theoret context spread exclusionari discriminatori attitud
TEXT:  It is also about preserving and expanding a basic secular and democratic consensus, against authoritarian developments. •Lastly, on an individual level, it is vital that anyone with an alternative or emancipatory economic orientation reflect on their own internal capitalism., LINE: 432, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: also expand basic secular democrat consensu authoritarian develop lastli individu level vital anyon altern emancipatori econom orient reflect intern capit
TEXT:  The history of alternative movements has clearly and repeatedly shown that attempts to break out can fail because of “society,” i.e. because of its various manifest power relations, but also because of the “society” that is in people themselves, i., LINE: 433, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: histori altern movement ha clearli repeatedli shown attempt break fail societi variou manifest power relat also societi peopl
TEXT: e. the internalization of ways of thinking, feeling and perceiving that are shaped by capitalism.96 This last item brings us to what I see as a key point: the emergence of a “society after money” will not in the end be decided on theoretical terrain, but will depend on the successful development, in the here and now, of forms of practice that give people an inner sense of security., LINE: 434, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: intern way think feel perceiv shape capit last item see key point emerg societi money end decid theoret terrain depend success develop form practic give peopl inner sens secur

TEXT:  This view is supported by the fact that objective certainties are being lost, by the critical and socio-psychological self-reflection of society, and by practical experience of social movements.

TEXT:  Marx (1872) speaks of the double freedom of the wage-laborer: the worker is free to enter into contracts, but at the same time also free from the “means of production.” It should be noted here that such a contract is always between a mouse and a lion, so to speak (Adorno): one cannot not enter into a contract, and the contract is always with a powerful “partner., LINE: 603, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: doubl freedom wage labor worker free enter contract time also free mean product note contract alway mous lion speak one cannot enter contract contract alway power partner

TEXT: 1 It ceases to be part of social wealth and instead is juxtaposed with it as a foreign object. The study of economics has undergone many upheavals since the time of Adam Smith.

TEXT:  At the same time, money, defined by its functions, shrivels to an entity that mediates between commodities sold on goods markets. The three functions classically ascribed to money under the generally accepted understanding of what money is (a means of payment, value storage, or a measure of value) always present it as a mere tool for the movement of commodities without any meaning beyond that., LINE: 692, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: time money defin function entiti commod sold good market three function classic money gener accept understand money mean payment valu storag measur valu alway present mere tool movement commod without mean beyond
TEXT:  As a universal means of payment, money multiplies the number of potential exchange partners to include any economic subject.2 Moreover, money’s value-storage function enables it to chronologically separate sale and purchase: thanks to money, the seller need not simultaneously be a buyer and can expand his or her exchange options to include commodities that are not even currently on the market., LINE: 693, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: univers mean payment money number potenti exchang partner includ econom subject moreov money valu storag function chronolog separ sale purchas thank money seller need simultan buyer expand exchang option includ commod even current market
TEXT:  As for money’s function as a unit of accounting or a measure of value, this element is presented as subordinate to the supposed primacy of goods and their use.

TEXT:  Once it is transformed into a commodity, a simple human product becomes a “social thing” (165) and, consequently, a thing that “transcends sensuousness” (163). As the instance that creates this social context in the first place, not only does wealth production consequently have a higher status than any other mode of production under capitalism but the transformation of the products of labor into agents of social mediation also fundamentally alters the content of social wealth., LINE: 708, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: commod simpl human product becom social thing consequ thing sensuous instanc social context first place doe wealth product consequ higher statu mode product capit transform product labor agent social mediat also fundament content social wealth

TEXT:  The production of goods-market commodities and their distribution is only a necessary byproduct of capital circulation, which uses money as its starting and end points.

TEXT:  And because Marx understood capitalist wealth as abstract wealth, for him (contrary to the classical understanding), money forms an integral component of capitalist wealth. 3. Money: The Segregated Universal Commodity In volume I of Capital, Marx explains what he sees as the fundamental difference between his critique of political economy and that of classical economists: It is one of the chief failings of classical economy that it has never succeeded, by means of its analysis of commodities, and in particular of their value, in discovering the form of value which in fact becomes exchange-value., LINE: 716, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: understood capitalist wealth abstract wealth contrari classic understand money form integr compon capitalist wealth money univers commod volum capit see fundament differ critiqu polit economi classic economist one chief fail classic economi ha never mean analysi commod particular valu form valu fact becom exchang valu
TEXT:  Even its best representatives, Adam Smith and Ricardo, treat the form of value as something of indifference, external to the nature of the commodity itself.

TEXT:  It lies deeper. The value-form of the product of labor is the most abstract, but also the most universal form of the bourgeois mode of production; by that fact it stamps the bourgeois mode of production as a particular kind of social production of a historical and transitory character., LINE: 718, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: lie valu form product labor abstract also univers form bourgeoi mode product fact stamp bourgeoi mode product particular kind social product histor transitori charact

TEXT:  This emerges sharply when they deal with banking, where the commonplace definitions of money will no longer hold water.

TEXT:  They and their successors derive money from exchange. According to them, it only exists due to a need for a medium that can facilitate the trading of consumer goods.

TEXT:  From this perspective, commodities’ social dimension consists in their representation of a specific sum of exchange value, or value. To put it another way, social mediation occurs via the products of labor and, consequently, via labor itself (see Postone 1993: 148–157) and it is only with this in mind that there can be any discussion of the fact that abstract labor forms the substance of value., LINE: 728, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: perspect commod social dimens represent specif sum exchang valu valu put anoth way social mediat via product labor consequ via labor see mind discuss fact abstract labor form substanc valu

TEXT:  The fundamental contradiction—that social labor is executed privately and only mediated via the placement of labor’s products in relation to one another—already implies that this mediation can fail.

TEXT:  Yet in its quantitative dimension (i.e. as an expression of a particular value sum), the expenditure of individual labor power is never a priori a value component of the social production of wealth. Social recognition of applied labor time is only determined ex post in the encounter between the various products of discrete private labor on the market: Social labor-time exists in these commodities in a latent state, so to speak, and becomes evident only in the course of their exchange., LINE: 731, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: yet quantit dimens express particular valu sum expenditur individu labor power never valu compon social product wealth social recognit appli labor time determin post encount variou product discret privat labor market social labor time commod latent state speak becom evid cours exchang

TEXT:  Universal social labor is consequently not a ready-made prerequisite but an emerging result. Marx 1970: 45 In order for the latent social labor time that exists within a commodity to be able to manifest itself as value, it must be exchanged for another commodity and its exchange value must be materialized in the use value of the received commodity., LINE: 733, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: univers social labor consequ readi made prerequisit result order latent social labor time within commod abl manifest valu must anoth commod exchang valu must use valu receiv commod

TEXT:  It transforms into the queen of all commodities, the commodity par excellence: it becomes money. Marx summarized the outcome as follows: Thus the contradiction inherent in the commodity as such, namely that of being a particular use value and simultaneously universal equivalent, and hence a use-value for everybody or a universal use-value, has been solved in the case of this one commodity., LINE: 736, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: queen commod commod par excel becom money outcom thu contradict inher commod name particular use valu simultan univers equival henc use valu everybodi univers use valu ha case one commod
TEXT:  Whereas now the exchange-value of all other commodities is in the first place presented in the form of an ideal equation with the commodity that has been set apart, an equation which has still to be realized; the use-value of this commodity, though real, seems in the exchange process to have merely a formal existence which has still to be realized by conversion into actual use-values., LINE: 737, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: wherea exchang valu commod first place form ideal equat commod ha set apart equat ha still use valu commod though real exchang process mere formal exist ha still convers actual use valu

TEXT:  Marx 1970: 48 Marx believed he had solved money’s riddle with his analysis of the sorting out of an absolute commodity.4 His remarks on monetary theory in his critiques of economics focus on this fundamental problem: The principal difficulty in the analysis of money is surmounted as soon as it is understood that the commodity is the origin of money., LINE: 740, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: money riddl analysi absolut commod remark monetari theori critiqu econom focu fundament problem princip difficulti analysi money surmount soon understood commod origin money
TEXT:  After that it is only a question of clearly comprehending the specific form peculiar to it.

TEXT:  That applies all the more to non-Marxists’s perception of Marx. But this perception of Marx’s monetary theory has fatal consequences. The fact that Marx, for the sake of simplicity, began his analysis with gold as the king’s commodity has been used to lump his concept of money together with classical metallism and, for the sake of convenience, to ignore the specific content of his monetary theory., LINE: 745, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: non percept percept monetari theori ha fatal consequ fact sake simplic analysi gold king commod ha use lump concept money togeth classic metal sake conveni ignor specif content monetari theori
TEXT:  A classic text on the history of economic theory thus maintains that, “The thinking behind metallism has been defended by representatives of a wide range of theoretical tendencies. For instance, Marx, under the influence of classical theory, develops a strongly metallist monetary theory in Capital in which he decisively rejects the view that money is merely a sign while also seeking evidence that money, as a commodity, derives its value exclusively from the working hours required for its production” (Stavenhagen 1969: 432)., LINE: 746, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: classic text histori econom theori thu think behind metal ha repres wide rang theoret tendenc instanc influenc classic theori strongli monetari theori capit decis reject view money mere sign also seek evid money commod valu exclus work hour product

TEXT:  By contrast, Marx’s concept of money as a commodity that stands apart also leaves room for a money commodity that is recruited from another part of the world of commodities.

TEXT:  Even if Marx never examined this complicating issue, the internal logic of his argument implies that the money commodity can just as well emanate from commodities traded on capital markets.6 This crucial difference between the classical and Marxian theories arises directly from their respective conceptions of the content of capitalist wealth., LINE: 750, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: even never issu intern logic argument money commod well eman commod capit market crucial differ classic theori directli respect concept content capitalist wealth
TEXT:  As outlined above, Adam Smith, the father of classical economics, regarded use values destined for consumption as actual commodity wealth and treated commodities’ exchange value as subordinate. But to interpret the commodity this way while simultaneously asserting that only commodities can constitute the material expression of money is necessarily to constrict the range of possible candidates for the position of money commodity to those commodities that are endowed with a material use value, i., LINE: 751, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: outlin smith father classic econom use valu consumpt actual commod wealth commod exchang valu subordin interpret commod way simultan commod constitut materi express money necessarili constrict rang possibl candid posit money commod commod materi use valu
TEXT: e. to commodities sold on goods markets. Marx, on the other hand, understands exchange value as the only thing that is socially relevant about particular commodities under capitalism. For him, money simply represents the embodiment of exchange value: It is the foundation of capitalist production that money confronts commodities as an autonomous form of value, or that exchange-value must obtain an autonomous form in money, and this is possible only if one particular commodity becomes the material in whose value all other commodities are measured, this thereby becoming the universal commodity, the commodity par excellence, in contrast to all other commodities., LINE: 752, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: commod sold good market hand exchang valu thing social relev particular commod capit money simpli embodi exchang valu foundat capitalist product money commod autonom form valu exchang valu must obtain autonom form money possibl one particular commod becom materi whose valu commod measur therebi becom univers commod commod par excel contrast commod

TEXT:  4. From Commodity Fetish to Money Fetish to Capital Fetish Bourgeois economics seeks to perceive a decidedly rational economic system in the capitalist mode of production.

TEXT:  The commodity is a fetish because human social relations slip into the products of their labor and, consequently, confront people in this material form as an external force. Or, in Marx’s own words: The mysterious character of the commodity-form consists … in the fact that the commodity reflects the social characteristics of men’s own labor as objective characteristics of the products of that labor themselves, as the socio-natural properties of these things., LINE: 756, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: commod fetish human social relat slip product labor consequ confront peopl materi form extern forc word mysteri charact commod form fact commod social characterist men labor object characterist product labor natur properti thing

TEXT:  Commodities’ exchange value dimension takes on a life of its own and becomes a special object that exists distinct from particular commodities—the stand-alone, universal commodity.

TEXT:  In Marx’s analysis, capital is, in the first place, a social process comprised of three metamorphoses7 in which value is “transformed into an automatic subject” (Marx 1990: 255) of the valorization of value through the exploitation of the particular use value of the labor commodity., LINE: 761, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: analysi capit first place social process compris three metamorphosi valu automat subject valor valu exploit particular use valu labor commod
TEXT:  In turn, this process also produces its own fetish form: the capital fetish.

TEXT:  While particular commodities can only ever be way stations in the process of the valorization of value, money constitutes its starting and end points.

TEXT:  This is not without repercussions for money itself. Its special place in the world of commodities as the starting point for capital circulation means that, “money receives, besides the use- value which it possesses as money, an additional use-value, namely the ability to function as capital., LINE: 764, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: without repercuss money special place world commod start point capit circul mean money besid use valu money addit use valu name abil function capit
TEXT:  Its use-value here consists precisely in the profit that it produces when transformed into capital. In this capacity of potential capital, as a means to the production of profit, it becomes a commodity, but a commodity of a special kind” (Marx 1991: 459–460)., LINE: 765, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: use valu precis profit produc capit capac potenti capit mean product profit becom commod commod special kind
TEXT:  While money, in its capacity as potential capital, in turn becomes a potential commodity, not only does the monetary exchange value of commodities take on a form that is itself separate from those commodities but the capital relationship, as money, is also expressed in a form that is external to the actual valorization of value and detached from functioning capital and its circulation., LINE: 766, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: money capac potenti capit turn becom potenti commod doe monetari exchang valu commod take form separ commod capit relationship money also express form extern actual valor valu detach capit circul
TEXT:  Consequently, another fetish form appears alongside the money fetish, namely the capital fetish.

TEXT:  Marx investigated one variant of the “superficial form of the capital relation” (Marx 1991: 515) above all, namely interest-bearing capital.

TEXT: e. of the commodities in their ever-exchangeable form, whether he wants to spend this money as money or hire it out as capital.

TEXT:  The social relation is consummated in the relationship of a thing, money, to itself. Instead of the actual transformation of money into capital, we have here only the form of this devoid of content. As in the case of labor-power, here the use-value of money is that of creating value, a greater value than is contained in itself., LINE: 770, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: social relat relationship thing money instead actual transform money capit form devoid content case labor power use valu money valu greater valu
TEXT:  Money as such is potentially self-valorizing value and it is as such that it is lent, this being the form of sale for this particular commodity. Thus it becomes as completely the property of money to create value, to yield interest, as it is the property of a pear tree to bear pears., LINE: 771, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: money potenti self valu lent form sale particular commod thu becom complet properti money creat valu yield interest properti pear tree bear pear
TEXT:  And it is as this interest-bearing thing that the money-lender sells his money. Marx 1991: 516 5. Second Order Commodities The preceding quotation is very popular in debates among Marxists.

TEXT:  Correspondingly, its reproduction is also the product of social relations. However, apart from capital formation through the exploitation of the labor commodity’s capacity to produce (surplus) value, which is a familiar topic in Marxist discussions, there is also a second variant that is omitted from those conversations: the relation that is mediated by the sale of the money-capital commodity can also produce abstract wealth., LINE: 775, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: correspondingli reproduct also product social relat howev apart capit format exploit labor commod capac produc surplu valu familiar topic discuss also second variant convers relat sale money capit commod also produc abstract wealth
TEXT:  Capital formation decoupled from actual valorization of value is no mere subjective delusion. Like the commodity and money fetishes, the capital fetish is a real fetish. In order to comprehend the mechanism of capital formation beyond the valorization of value, we must look above all at a particular feature of the money-capital commodity: the dual exploitation of its use value by both buyer and seller., LINE: 776, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: capit format actual valor valu mere subject delus like commod money fetish capit fetish real fetish order comprehend mechan capit format beyond valor valu must look particular featur money capit commod dual exploit use valu buyer seller
TEXT:  A thing like that would be inconceivable for the goods-market commodities that Marx analyzed in the first volume of Capital: if a person sells an apple, that person can no longer eat it thereafter. As far as this segment of the commodity universe is concerned, sale inevitably means the complete and final transfer of a commodity’s use value to the buyer., LINE: 777, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: thing like would inconceiv good market commod first volum capit person sell appl person longer eat thereaft far segment commod univers concern sale inevit mean complet final transfer commod use valu buyer
TEXT:  When a sum of money is sold as money capital, obviously the buyer also obtains the use value of that money. With that sum of money on hand, the buyer can then use it, for example, as a medium of exchange., LINE: 778, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: sum money sold money capit obvious buyer also use valu money sum money hand buyer use exampl medium exchang
TEXT:  But that does not mean that the seller can no longer exploit the use value of that sum of money. On the contrary, by giving that money away on condition that it will be augmented and then returned, the seller exploits its use value as potential capital., LINE: 779, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: doe mean seller longer exploit use valu sum money contrari give money away condit augment return seller exploit use valu potenti capit
TEXT:  But the transfer of the original sum does not enable the simultaneous exploitation of its use value by two different economic actors. Through the transfer of the original sum as a loan or other form of money capital,8 its exchange value is duplicated during the time that money is separated from the seller., LINE: 780, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: transfer origin sum doe enabl simultan exploit use valu two differ econom actor transfer origin sum loan form money capit exchang valu time money seller
TEXT:  Even though the original sum has been passed to the money-capital buyer, the seller is by no means left empty handed. The seller has a monetary claim against the buyer and that is the seller’s capital., LINE: 781, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: even though origin sum ha money capit buyer seller mean left empti hand seller ha monetari claim buyer seller capit
TEXT:  In order to distinguish it from the capital that is involved in actual value production, Marx called such independently existing mirror images of the original monetary sum “fictitious capital.” In turn, the economic significance of this “fictitious capital” depends on the social form that it takes., LINE: 782, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: order distinguish capit involv actual valu product independ mirror imag origin monetari sum fictiti capit turn econom signific fictiti capit social form take
TEXT:  As long as the mirror image of the original capital is a non-transferable, personal claim to repayment and interest, as in the case of credit between private individuals, it will constitute capital for its owner., LINE: 783, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: long mirror imag origin capit non transfer person claim repay interest case credit privat individu constitut capit owner
TEXT:  But it will not enter into economic circulation and, in this respect, the duplication of the initial sum into the original and its mirror image will make no significant difference overall. That changes, however, with the circulation of the initial capital’s mirror image: the payment bond., LINE: 784, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: enter econom circul respect duplic initi sum origin mirror imag make signific differ overal chang howev circul initi capit mirror imag payment bond
TEXT:  This can happen indirectly, as for example when money capital is loaned to a bank and thus becomes the starting point for lending by that bank. In that case, additional social capital is formed. It can also occur directly, namely when the monetary claim itself takes the form of a tradable commodity and circulates, such as in the form of shares or securitized debt as in the case of corporate or government bonds., LINE: 785, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: happen indirectli exampl money capit bank thu becom start point bank case addit social capit form also occur directli name monetari claim take form tradabl commod form share debt case corpor govern bond
TEXT:  These commodities that are traded on capital markets represent capitalist wealth just as much as the commodities produced by functioning capital. Their genesis, however, is fundamentally different from that of the particular commodities traded on goods markets., LINE: 786, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: commod capit market repres capitalist wealth much commod produc capit genesi howev fundament differ particular commod good market
TEXT:  That is why I have called commodities traded on finance markets “second order commodities,” in order to distinguish them from commodities sold in goods markets, which I have therefore called “first order commodities” (Lohoff and Trenkle 2012: 124–138)., LINE: 787, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: commod financ market second order commod order distinguish commod sold good market therefor first order commod
TEXT:  While first order commodities represent past labor (i.e. value that has already been generated), second order commodities embody pre-capitalized future value. The notion that money can breed money even without taking a detour through the exploitation of living labor is therefore not simply a misperception on the part of the money capitalists who partake of the profits of others., LINE: 788, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: first order commod repres past labor valu ha alreadi second order commod embodi futur valu notion money breed money even without take detour exploit live labor therefor simpli mispercept part money capitalist partak profit
TEXT: 9 The successful sale of shares and debt instruments as well as credit linkage actually represent a distinct form of capital formation based on the anticipation of value.

TEXT: 10 6. The Inner Categorial Segmentation of the Money System Putting the capital fetish aside, we return now to the money fetish and the logical status of the Marxian concept of money. Whereas the critique of political economy describes money as the stand-alone universal commodity, it should be noted that this designation refers to the money system as a whole., LINE: 790, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: inner categori segment money system capit fetish asid return money fetish logic statu concept money wherea critiqu polit economi money stand alon univers commod note design money system whole
TEXT:  Just as the king’s position as master of the judicial system in an absolutist regime in no way compelled him to personally pass judgment on any accused person, the universal commodity need not physically appear in everyday payment transactions and directly confront goods-market commodities., LINE: 791, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: king posit master judici system absolutist regim way person judgment accus person univers commod need physic appear everyday payment transact directli confront good market commod
TEXT:  Just as the monarch had his representatives to adjudicate in his name, so the money commodity can withdraw from everyday business and delegate that responsibility in whole or in part.11 Not everything that assumes the function of money in daily life is thus itself a money commodity., LINE: 792, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: monarch repres adjud name money commod withdraw everyday busi deleg respons whole part everyth function money daili life thu money commod
TEXT:  However—and this is critical—every developed, functioning money system is based on a money commodity. Accordingly, the thing that we conventionally call “money” is not at all the same thing as the money commodity in the meaning of Marx’s theory., LINE: 793, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: howev critic everi money system base money commod accordingli thing convent call money thing money commod mean theori
TEXT:  In Marx’s time, money (in the conventional sense) was primarily composed of derivative monetary forms that did not embody abstract wealth on their own terms but rather only attain that capacity by way of their relationship to the king’s commodity., LINE: 794, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: time money convent sens wa primarili compos deriv monetari form embodi abstract wealth term rather attain capac way relationship king commod
TEXT:  From the perspective of the critique of political economy, we can distinguish between two basic types of these logically subordinated monetary forms. On one hand, there are money tokens, such as paper money or coins, issued by the guardian of the universal commodity: the central bank., LINE: 795, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: perspect critiqu polit economi distinguish two basic type logic monetari form one hand money token paper money coin guardian univers commod central bank
TEXT:  Their capacity to represent abstract wealth is governed by the money commodity owned by the central bank. On the other hand, there are private money surrogates, or payment bonds issued by private actors and denominated in the legal tender that, in turn, become substitutes for legal tender., LINE: 796, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: capac repres abstract wealth money commod central bank hand privat money surrog payment bond privat actor legal tender turn becom substitut legal tender
TEXT:  In his writings, Marx addressed this second, derivative monetary form primarily by using the example of the bill of exchange, the most important type of credit money during his lifetime. In categorical terms, the bill of exchange, like the subsequently developed credit money variants, is a second order commodity and represents anticipated value., LINE: 797, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: write second deriv monetari form primarili exampl bill exchang import type credit money lifetim categor term bill exchang like subsequ credit money variant second order commod valu
TEXT:  As a transferrable and interest-bearing payment bond, it and its ilk belong to the world of commodities, however, like all types of tradable private payment bonds, it is classified as a particular commodity—which distinguishes it from the money commodity., LINE: 798, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: interest bear payment bond ilk belong world commod howev like type tradabl privat payment bond classifi particular commod money commod
TEXT:  The bill of exchange brought this surrogate character into sharp relief, given that it represented the issuer’s obligation to exchange the promissory note for “proper money” at a fixed date. In the case of modern credit money, through which commercial banks payment obligations mediate payment transactions between accountholders, permanent offsetting processes make this subordinated status a bit more obscure., LINE: 799, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: bill exchang brought surrog charact sharp relief given issuer oblig exchang promissori note proper money fix date case modern credit money commerci bank payment oblig mediat payment transact perman process make statu bit obscur
TEXT:  But the heart of the matter—the substitution of payment bonds issued by commercial actors for legal tender—has not changed at all. Anyone who goes to a supermarket checkout and reaches for a debit card to pay from a checking account rather than with cash assigns that supermarket a monetary claim against a bank., LINE: 800, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: heart matter substitut payment bond commerci actor legal tender ha anyon go supermarket reach debit card pay account rather cash supermarket monetari claim bank
TEXT:  That process logically presupposes the existence of legal tender.12 In Marx’s time, alongside the physical money commodity in the form of gold coins, private economic actors primarily used banknotes and small change as a means of payment., LINE: 801, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: process logic exist legal tender time alongsid physic money commod form gold coin privat econom actor primarili use small chang mean payment
TEXT:  These tokens of the money commodity, which serve as legal tender to this day, are neither the universal commodity nor a particular commodity but rather purely money symbols. Regarded in isolation, they embody neither value that has already been produced nor anticipated value., LINE: 802, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: token money commod serv legal tender day neither univers commod particular commod rather pure money symbol isol embodi neither valu ha alreadi produc valu
TEXT:  Instead, they refer to the money commodity. They are backed by the capitalist wealth accumulated by the authority that issues money tokens. It is not their vanishingly small intrinsic value nor their ominous scarcity but rather the central banks accumulated stocks of the money commodity that confer social significance upon these money symbols and turn them into proxies for value., LINE: 803, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: instead refer money commod back capitalist wealth author issu money token vanishingli small intrins valu omin scarciti rather central bank stock money commod social signific upon money symbol turn proxi valu
TEXT:  7. The Change in the Money Commodity Every developed capitalist money system adheres to the structure outlined above and is comprised of the three basic elements described here: the actual money commodity, which is primarily or exclusively found in the vaults and balance sheets of a central bank; the money tokens issued by the central bank; and private credit money., LINE: 804, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: chang money commod everi capitalist money system structur outlin compris three basic element actual money commod primarili exclus found vault balanc sheet central bank money token central bank privat credit money
TEXT:  A currency system that strays from this fundamental structure and renounces a money commodity cannot function.

TEXT:  Whereas gold and silver shared the role of money commodity during Marx’s lifetime (bi-metallism), gold alone became dominant in every major capitalist country in the late nineteenth century. Under the classical gold-standard system, money tokens’ dependence on the money commodity and its value was clearly demonstrated by the fact that their relationship was established by law., LINE: 807, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: wherea gold silver role money commod lifetim metal gold alon domin everi major capitalist countri late nineteenth centuri classic gold standard system money token depend money commod valu wa clearli fact relationship wa establish law

TEXT:  Nonetheless, gold-backed money was not the last word in capitalist development for all time. The way that productive powers developed in the first half of the twentieth century led to a dramatic increase in the advance costs of producing surplus value, making it increasingly difficult (to the point of impossibility) to defray those expenses solely with previously accumulated abstract wealth., LINE: 811, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: nonetheless gold back money wa last word capitalist develop time way product power first half twentieth centuri led dramat increas advanc cost surplu valu make increasingli difficult point imposs defray expens sole previous abstract wealth

TEXT:  The mysterious ability (outlined in the section about second order commodities) to transform future value production into capital beforehand through the sale of money capital and the dual application of its use value was only a marginal factor in the capitalist accumulation process during Marx’s time and remained an epiphenomenon that was limited to private capital markets., LINE: 820, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: mysteri abil outlin section second order commod transform futur valu product capit beforehand sale money capit dual applic use valu wa margin factor capitalist accumul process time epiphenomenon wa limit privat capit market

TEXT:  Unlike the classical money commodity, a money commodity that owes its special status to its owner is necessarily synthetic in nature. Composed of central banks monetary claims as a kind of composite commodity, it is subject to a process of permanent recombination., LINE: 837, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: unlik classic money commod money commod special statu owner necessarili synthet natur compos central bank monetari claim kind composit commod subject process perman recombin
TEXT:  Central bank credits are continuously expiring and being re-granted; second order commodities are continuously traded between commercial banks and central banks.

TEXT:  If, for the sake of simplicity, we disregard the non-monetary applications of the precious metal, then the dimensions of the money commodity were identical to the full breadth of the precious metal that had been pried out of the Earth., LINE: 840, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: sake simplic disregard non monetari applic preciou metal dimens money commod ident full breadth preciou metal pri earth
TEXT:  The expansion of the system of abstract wealth created more demand for additional money commodity, which, within the framework of the gold standard, could thus only be met one way: by mining more gold., LINE: 841, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: expans system abstract wealth demand addit money commod within framework gold standard could thu met one way mine gold
TEXT:  The change in the money commodity provided a great deal more leeway for the self-justifying system of expanding abstract wealth. Under the gold standard, a portion of the wealth produced was withdrawn from the accumulation process and decommissioned just so that money could fulfill its duty as the absolute commodity., LINE: 842, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: chang money commod provid great deal leeway self justifi system expand abstract wealth gold standard portion wealth produc wa withdrawn accumul process money could fulfil duti absolut commod
TEXT:  The transition to the new money commodity not only meant the end of these faux frais (overhead) in the overall business of capitalism.

TEXT:  But there is a price to be paid for this tremendous advantage. First and foremost, the change in the money commodity means that it is only effective in a smaller field. Gold was not only the universal commodity within particular currency areas, but in bar form it simultaneously functioned directly as a global currency., LINE: 844, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: price tremend advantag first foremost chang money commod mean effect smaller field gold wa univers commod within particular currenc area bar form simultan directli global currenc
TEXT:  By contrast, its successor’s domain is limited to any given particular currency zone. That inevitably has an effect on the exchange relations between various regional money tokens as well. While the gold standard automatically resulted in fixed exchange rates between the legal tender of various countries due to the fact that it linked all currencies to the precious metal, the ultimate renunciation of gold meant transitioning to unstable exchange rates., LINE: 845, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: contrast successor domain limit given particular currenc zone inevit ha effect exchang relat variou region money token well gold standard automat fix exchang rate legal tender variou countri due fact link currenc preciou metal ultim renunci gold meant unstabl exchang rate
TEXT:  But the change in the money commodity had yet another shortcoming. Unless someone should achieve the alchemical dream of turning worthless materials into gold, the old money commodity will continue to retain its capacity to embody abstract wealth without any deterioration until the day capitalism ceases to exist., LINE: 846, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: chang money commod yet anoth shortcom unless someon achiev alchem dream turn worthless materi gold old money commod continu retain capac embodi abstract wealth without deterior day capit ceas exist

TEXT:  The money issued by central banks consistently loses a portion of its backing—with corresponding long-term consequences for its “monetary value.” Inflation trends are very good indicators of the loss of structural validity., LINE: 848, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: money central bank consist portion back correspond long term consequ monetari valu inflat trend good indic loss structur valid
TEXT:  While an economic cycle under the gold standard used to include fluctuations in the exchange relationship between any given particular commodity, on one hand, and the universal commodity and its paper surrogate, on the other, ultimately there was no trend toward monetary devaluation across business cycles., LINE: 849, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: econom cycl gold standard use includ fluctuat exchang relationship given particular commod one hand univers commod paper surrog ultim wa trend toward monetari devalu across busi cycl
TEXT:  This changed fundamentally with the end of gold’s singular hegemony. It is no coincidence that the term “secular inflation” has taken root among economic historians. The purchasing power of money tokens has disintegrated in parallel with the capitalist accumulation process since at least the end of the Second World War., LINE: 850, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: fundament end gold singular hegemoni coincid term secular inflat ha taken root among econom historian power money token ha parallel capitalist accumul process sinc least end second world war
TEXT:  Sometimes that erosion process is stronger, sometimes weaker, but it has long been an integral component of the normal function of capitalism. That applies to such an extent that economists hear alarm bells whenever the inflation rate drops below the two-percent mark because it is considered a sign of crisis., LINE: 851, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: sometim eros process sometim ha long integr compon normal function capit extent economist hear alarm bell whenev inflat rate drop two percent mark consid sign crisi
TEXT:  In a society that has dissipated into isolated private producers, competition will naturally produce winners and losers.

TEXT:  In every period, one commodity or another—or one form of individual capital or another—is subject to devaluation and falls by the wayside. If devaluation of commodities or capital should become a mass phenomenon and valorization should shift from norm to exception, the matter would certainly be alarming, from a capitalist perspective, as it would mean that the system of abstract wealth is in crisis., LINE: 853, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: everi period one commod anoth one form individu capit anoth subject devalu fall waysid devalu commod capit becom mass phenomenon valor shift norm except matter would certainli alarm capitalist perspect would mean system abstract wealth crisi
TEXT:  The change in the money commodity also has far reaching consequences for the course and the composition of such crises. While gold was positioned as the money commodity, the devaluation process during times of crisis was focused on particular commodities., LINE: 854, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: chang money commod also ha far reach consequ cours composit crisi gold wa posit money commod devalu process time crisi wa particular commod
TEXT:  Private functioning and fictitious capital might have been devalued, but never the universal commodity: with the change in the money commodity, its very creation becomes a moment in the process of capitalist accumulation, which also means that, during major crises, the devaluation process can, in principle, also encroach on the monetary medium as a whole—a development that was absolutely impossible when gold was the money commodity., LINE: 855, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: privat fictiti capit might never univers commod chang money commod creation becom moment process capitalist accumul also mean major crisi devalu process principl also encroach monetari medium whole develop wa absolut imposs gold wa money commod
TEXT:  Marx explained how devaluation crises progress under the gold standard. On the one hand, during crises, the particular commodities that constitute functioning capital are devalued. That applies primarily to products that are no longer marketable or will only sell below their value and secondarily to the machines and raw materials to be used in production., LINE: 856, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: devalu crisi progress gold standard one hand crisi particular commod constitut capit primarili product longer market sell valu secondarili machin raw materi use product
TEXT:  On the other hand, the replacement of the money commodity with private monetary surrogates becomes the problem: In times of pressure, when credit contracts or dries up altogether, money suddenly confronts commodities absolutely as the only means of payment and the true existence of value., LINE: 857, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: hand replac money commod privat monetari surrog becom problem time pressur credit contract dri altogeth money suddenli commod absolut mean payment true exist valu
TEXT:  Hence the general devaluation of commodities and the difficulty or even impossibility of transforming them into money, i.e. into their own purely fantastic form. Secondly, however, credit money is itself only money in so far as it absolutely represents real money into the sum of its nominal value., LINE: 858, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: henc gener devalu commod difficulti even imposs transform money pure fantast form secondli howev credit money money far absolut real money sum nomin valu
TEXT:  With a drain of gold, its convertibility into money becomes problematic, i.e. its identity with actual gold. Marx 1991: 648 When Marx speaks of a monetary crisis, it is only ever in this narrow sense of an acute lack of socially valid capacity to pay (solvency)., LINE: 859, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: drain gold convert money becom problemat ident actual gold monetari crisi ever narrow sens acut lack social valid capac pay solvenc
TEXT:  To the extent that private actors’ payment bonds can no longer sufficiently substitute for the money commodity, the monetary base contracts, thus allowing commodity prices to fall through the floor and paralyzing the production of goods., LINE: 860, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: extent privat actor payment bond longer suffici substitut money commod monetari base contract thu commod price fall floor product good
TEXT:  Accordingly, Marx summarizes what is at the core of the crisis mechanism as follows: A devaluation of credit money (not to speak of a complete loss of its monetary character, which is in any case purely imaginary) would destroy all the existing relationships., LINE: 861, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: accordingli core crisi mechan devalu credit money speak complet loss monetari charact case pure imaginari would destroy relationship
TEXT:  The value of commodities is thus sacrificed in order to ensure the fantastic and autonomous existence of this value in money. In any event, a money value is only guaranteed as long as money itself is guaranteed., LINE: 862, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: valu commod thu order ensur fantast autonom exist valu money event money valu long money
TEXT:  This is why many millions’ worth of commodities have to be sacrificed for a few millions in money. This is unavoidable in capitalist production, and forms one of its particular charms. Marx 1991: 532 But the apodictic statement that sacrificing particular commodities on the altar of the universal commodity during a crisis is one of the unavoidable “charms” of “capitalist production” must be put into perspective., LINE: 863, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: mani million worth commod million money unavoid capitalist product form one particular charm apodict statement sacrif particular commod altar univers commod crisi one unavoid charm capitalist product must put perspect
TEXT:  This mechanism only makes undisturbed headway during crises when the monetary order is based on the gold standard.

TEXT:  When central banks reduce interest rates and increase their own “money creation,” they can prevent impending credit squeezes and thereby take action against the devaluation of particular commodities. However—and this is the downside—“actual money” (Marx) also loses its position as the radiant Sol Invictus over the countries in crisis., LINE: 865, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: central bank reduc interest rate increas money creation prevent impend credit squeez therebi take action devalu particular commod howev downsid actual money also posit radiant sol countri crisi

TEXT:  These measures only postpone the need for devaluation, specifically by shifting it to the monetary medium as such.

TEXT:  The economic ruptures in the years immediately after gold was finally demonetized followed a new set of rules.

TEXT:  In 2008, when the worst devaluation spiral in the history of private fictitious capital was looming and threatened to take the entire global economy down with it, the central banks stepped in and brought the system of pre-capitalization of future value production back onto a growth trajectory with a policy of super-cheap money., LINE: 870, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: worst devalu spiral histori privat fictiti capit wa loom take entir global economi central bank step brought system capit futur valu product back onto growth trajectori polici super cheap money

TEXT:  9. Functionally Defining Money and Making the Money Commodity Invisible The path that the central banks have taken since 2008 is even starting to make many economists nervous about inflation, but the theoretical precepts of conventional economics do not allow its adherents to locate the fundamental problem where it actually is., LINE: 875, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: function money make money commod invis path central bank taken sinc even start make mani economist nervou inflat theoret precept convent econom allow adher locat fundament problem actual

TEXT:  They have no concept of abstract wealth and they confuse commodity wealth with wealth in material use value. Anybody who, following in Adam Smith’s footsteps, can only perceive commodity wealth where material use value appears as a bearer of exchange value will be logically incapable of seeing a money commodity that originates among second order commodities., LINE: 878, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: concept abstract wealth confus commod wealth wealth materi use valu anybodi follow smith footstep perceiv commod wealth materi use valu bearer exchang valu logic incap see money commod among second order commod
TEXT:  The various titles of ownership that central banks accumulate in the course of their money-creation process simply have no material use value, unlike the classical money commodity: gold.

TEXT:  Because the prevailing thinking assumes that its own blind spots are ineluctable truths, the change in the money commodity looks like its disappearance. But the absence of a term for abstract wealth, on one hand, and the equation of commodity wealth with wealth in material use values, on the other, are not the only reasons why the prevailing line of reasoning mistakes the process of demonetizing gold (which reached its conclusion in 1971) with the de-commodification of money., LINE: 880, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: think blind spot ineluct truth chang money commod look like disappear absenc term abstract wealth one hand equat commod wealth wealth materi use valu reason line reason mistak process gold conclus money
TEXT:  The functionalist understanding of money keeps conventional economics blind to the new money commodity; economists cut off debate concerning the nature of money decades ago with no resolution.

TEXT:  Consequently, the generally recognized functionalist view of money produces an image of today’s money system that inverts the real hierarchy that exists between the actual money commodity and the derivative form of money: only the derivative form is actually presented as money while, by contrast, the basis of the money system is theoretically eliminated., LINE: 887, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: consequ gener functionalist view money produc imag today money system real hierarchi actual money commod deriv form money deriv form actual money contrast basi money system theoret
TEXT:  Although the prevailing concept of money erases the categorial difference between money tokens, on one hand, and private fictitious capital that serves as means of payment, on the other, it still sneaks back into economic doctrine through the back door of the various (abstractly and purely experiential) definitions of the money supply., LINE: 888, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: although concept money categori differ money token one hand privat fictiti capit serf mean payment still sneak back econom doctrin back door variou abstractli pure experienti definit money suppli
TEXT:  Conventional economics applies “narrower” and “broader” definitions of the money supply, which are differentiated by their account of which “liquid” assets count as money and which do not.

TEXT:  Alongside conventional money supplies S1 to S3, it also acknowledges the monetary base S0. But it does not in any way conceal the money commodity.

TEXT: e. claims to repayment and interest on the credit concerned within a defined period of time. Only the first aspect is reflected in the definitions of the money supply. In order to adhere to S0, the “monetary base” therefore comprises the cash brought into circulation via the granting of credit to the commercial banks and the sight deposits that represent the part of the money capital transferred by the central banks to the commercial banks that currently have not found their way into the system of private credit-linkage formation., LINE: 896, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: claim repay interest credit concern within defin period time first aspect reflect definit money suppli order adher monetari base therefor cash brought circul via credit commerci bank sight deposit repres part money capit transfer central bank commerci bank current found way system privat credit linkag format

TEXT:  This is all the more true when we consider that there is a broad swath of market participants for whom money really is only a medium for moving commodities.

TEXT:  The conventional concept of money does not take this detail into account. By conceiving money as a simple means for moving commodities, it explains the content of capitalist economic activity as a C–M–C motion and obscures the fact that it consists of a self-justifying C–M–C’ motion., LINE: 908, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: convent concept money doe take detail account money simpl mean move commod content capitalist econom activ motion fact self justifi motion
TEXT:  Money absolutely does function as a universal means of circulation, but only insofar as it is integrated into the circulation of capital valorization.

TEXT:  The paradigm of capitalism as a rational mode of production has also come under increasing pressure, particularly in recent years. Neither the continually broadening swath of ecological and social devastation that has battered the capitalist economic system nor the constantly renewed episodes of crisis that have convulsed the global capitalist system since the start of the century fit neatly with the primordial myth of liberalism and Western civilization., LINE: 913, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: paradigm capit ration mode product ha also come increas pressur particularli recent year neither continu swath ecolog social devast ha batter capitalist econom system constantli episod crisi global capitalist system sinc start centuri fit neatli primordi myth liber western civil
TEXT:  This development is not without impact on the field of debate.

TEXT:  Philosophers, ethnologists and dissident economists have published numerous works on money in recent years, primarily distancing themselves from the established concept of money in two respects: on one hand, they have attacked the classical derivation of money from exchange., LINE: 915, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: philosoph ethnologist dissid economist numer work money recent year primarili establish concept money two respect one hand classic deriv money exchang
TEXT:  In this regard, the new debate about money is responding to the all-transcendent implication of credit for the money of our time as it deviates from the old exchange paradigm and the phenomenon of debt moves into focus., LINE: 916, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: regard new debat money transcend implic credit money time deviat old exchang paradigm phenomenon debt move focu
TEXT:  On the other hand, the antics of the financial markets have given rise to positions that regard money (ostensibly a merely technical medium) as a force with irrational, indeed profoundly sacral traits., LINE: 917, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: hand antic financi market given rise posit regard money ostens mere technic medium forc irrat inde profoundli sacral trait
TEXT:  11. Marx and the Blind Spots in the New Debate Around Money If we were to search the historical theories for concepts of money that comprehend its modern incarnation as a genuinely irrational and metaphysical thing, we would not be burdened with an overabundance., LINE: 918, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: blind spot new debat around money search histor theori concept money comprehend modern incarn genuin irrat metaphys thing would overabund
TEXT:  By far the most elaborate analysis to adopt this position undoubtedly comes from Marx, who insisted that the fundamental irrationality of the capitalist mode of production culminates and becomes palpable in its money., LINE: 919, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: far elabor analysi adopt posit undoubtedli come fundament irration capitalist mode product becom palpabl money
TEXT:  In its search for potential theoretical reference points, we might therefore expect that the new debate around money would look to the concept of money found in the critique of political economy and sound out its explanatory power—all the more so given that Marx is no longer generally regarded as a dead dog and his name has at least re-entered circulation as a token., LINE: 920, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: search potenti theoret refer point might therefor expect new debat around money would look concept money found critiqu polit economi sound explanatori power given longer gener dead dog name ha least circul token
TEXT:  Yet Marx’s theory of money as the segregated universal commodity has been completely disregarded in the current debate. As explained above, his concept of money has been erroneously associated with metallist theory and treated as a variant of the classical money theory based on the exchange paradigm., LINE: 921, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: yet theori money univers commod ha complet current debat concept money ha erron associ theori variant classic money theori base exchang paradigm
TEXT:  Blind adoption of that incorrect association is certainly one reason why the newly aroused interest in the question of money has been paralleled by a widespread disinterest in Marx’s approach. But there is something else that is significantly more important: while the new debate about money does attack individual theorems of mainstream economics, it does so without critically assessing its underlying false axioms., LINE: 922, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: blind adopt incorrect associ certainli one reason newli interest question money ha widespread disinterest approach someth els significantli import new debat money doe attack individu theorem econom doe without critic underli fals axiom
TEXT:  It does correctly break away from the notion of money as an ostensibly neutral medium for the movement of goods, but it also breathlessly adopts the paradigm of money as an entity that is foreign and external to the system of wealth production in the commodity society., LINE: 923, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: doe correctli break away notion money ostens neutral medium movement good also breathlessli paradigm money entiti foreign extern system wealth product commod societi
TEXT:  The new money debate thus has a blind spot with respect to Marx’s concept of money. That debate has a particular quirk that arises in connection with this blind spot: its tendency to explain the irrationality of the contemporary money system diachronically, i., LINE: 924, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: new money debat thu ha blind spot respect concept money debat ha particular quirk connect blind spot tendenc explain irration contemporari money system
TEXT: e. to derive it from money’s prehistory.

TEXT:  It thus exclusively refers to the capitalist mode of production, in which the commodity has become the universal form of wealth. As such, it argues in purely logical terms that attempt to decipher the internal logic of this social formation in which money occupies a key position and has a historically specific character that cannot be deduced from any of the various universal histories of money that span multiple modes of production., LINE: 926, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: thu exclus capitalist mode product commod ha becom univers form wealth pure logic term attempt deciph intern logic social format money key posit ha histor specif charact cannot variou univers histori money span multipl mode product
TEXT:  To attempt to do so is to essentially treat money as an entity that is external to capitalist society—one that always remains the same and has only ever changed in superficial ways. This makes it seems obvious to derive the irrationality of today’s money system from a fundamentally unchanging essence of money—a very pronounced tendency in today’s debate around money., LINE: 927, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: attempt essenti treat money entiti extern capitalist societi one alway remain ha ever superfici way make obviou deriv irration today money system fundament unchang essenc money pronounc tendenc today debat around money
TEXT:  Even if their initial reason for paying closer attention to money was assuredly to examine the follies of contemporary money, books by David Graeber (2014), Christina von Braun (2012) and Christoph Türcke (2015) leap thousands of years into the past., LINE: 928, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: even initi reason pay closer attent money wa assuredli examin folli contemporari money book leap thousand year past
TEXT:  They all engage in a kind of etymology of the language of the monetary and hope that doing so will shed light on the chasms in the contemporary financial system.

TEXT:  David Graeber, ethnologist and pioneer of the Occupy movement, took that approach to profoundly critique Adam Smith’s monetary origin myth and received a certain amount of ideological credit for it. In his book Debt: The First 5000 Years, he uses extensive ethnological material to expose the evolution of money from exchange as exactly what it is: a purely ideological construct., LINE: 930, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: ethnologist pioneer occupi movement took approach profoundli critiqu smith monetari origin myth receiv certain amount ideolog credit book debt first year us extens ethnolog materi expos evolut money exchang exactli pure ideolog construct
TEXT:  But as the title of his bestseller indicates, he replaces Smith’s ontology of exchange with a no less misleading ontology of debt. Contemporary credit relations, which represent the most significant form of trade with the commodity money capital, look to him like the extension of sanctified personal debt relations by other means., LINE: 931, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: titl smith ontolog exchang less mislead ontolog debt contemporari credit relat repres signific form trade commod money capit look like extens sanctifi person debt relat mean
TEXT:  But relative to classical or contemporary mainstream economics, this is not a step forward in knowledge. Instead, it is only an inversion of the existing projection: whereas the exchange-ontology perspective projects the dissolution of society into isolated private producers (a characteristic feature of the modern capitalist mode of production) onto prehistory, Graeber views the modern credit system through the lens of pre-modern personal debt relations., LINE: 932, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: rel classic contemporari econom step forward knowledg instead invers project wherea exchang ontolog perspect project dissolut societi isol privat produc characterist featur modern capitalist mode product onto prehistori view modern credit system len modern person debt relat
TEXT:  But modern credit relations must be understood simply as a specific variant of objectified commodity relations. Their basis is the transformation of money capital into a commodity, which in turn logically requires capital relations: the transformation of material wealth production into commodity production., LINE: 933, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: modern credit relat must understood simpli specif variant commod relat basi transform money capit commod turn logic capit relat transform materi wealth product commod product
TEXT:  Adam Smith contrived a market-liberal fantasy image of traditional societies; Graeber, in his account of contemporary financial systems, turns fabulist and projects forms of personal domination onto them., LINE: 934, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: smith market liber fantasi imag tradit societi account contemporari financi system turn fabulist project form person domin onto
TEXT:  That may correspond to the personifying notions of common sense and that is not the least of the reasons why it is so popular. But in analytical terms, it is a misleading path. Graeber’s is not the only interpretation that grows analytically weaker as it approaches the present., LINE: 935, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: may correspond notion common sens least reason popular analyt term mislead path interpret analyt approach present
TEXT:  That is a shortcoming that more or less characterizes the entire body of recent criticism of money, which in turn is an outcome of those texts’ initial premise. For all the differences in their argumentation, anyone who claims that only the “sacrificial religious” core (Türcke 2015) of earlier forms of money is reproduced in the modern financial system or that money is “backed by human bodies” (von Braun 2012) is assuming that money, in the end, has essentially always remained the same., LINE: 936, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: shortcom less entir bodi recent critic money turn outcom text initi premis differ argument anyon claim sacrifici religi core form money modern financi system money back human bodi assum money end ha essenti alway

TEXT:  Money gives the exchange-value side of particular commodities a form that is separate from their specific use values; it allows exchange value to face the world of commodities as a power unto itself. The prevailing thinking is fooled by this fetishistic illusion and treats money as though it were a thing that actually exists outside the system of commodity production and were not merely an externalized, tangible form of the internal contradictions of the world of commodities., LINE: 939, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: money give exchang valu side particular commod form separ specif use valu exchang valu face world commod power unto think fetishist illus treat money though thing actual outsid system commod product mere tangibl form intern contradict world commod
TEXT:  One variant of this interpretive model is the classical and neoclassical concept of the “veil of money,” according to which money is assumed to be a purely technical medium that must be ignored in order to see the actual essential economic processes., LINE: 940, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: one variant interpret model classic concept veil money accord money assum pure technic medium must order see actual essenti econom process
TEXT:  The representatives of the new debate around money knowingly disengage from the “classical and neoclassical monetary oblivion” (Pahl 2008: 9).

TEXT:  This, however, is a questionable perspective. To adopt it is to risk drifting toward a complementary version of the old two-worlds concept. The development of the capitalist mode of production has always been accompanied by a regressive “anti-capitalism” that attacks a given financial or monetary order as an occupying force that is alien to the commodity society and pushes away responsibility for the evils of the capitalist form of socialization., LINE: 942, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: howev question perspect adopt risk drift toward complementari version old two world concept develop capitalist mode product ha alway regress anti capit attack given financi monetari order forc alien commod societi push away respons evil capitalist form social
TEXT:  Sayings like “money makes the world go round” or “money is the root of all evil” are indications of the extent to which the conventional understanding is conditioned to blame only the material embodiments that seem like threats to the commodity society., LINE: 943, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: say like money make world round money root evil indic extent convent understand condit blame materi embodi seem like threat commod societi
TEXT:  Particularly during times of crisis, intellectual leadership is consistently granted to ideologies that derive a pseudo-explanation for capitalism’s disastrous developments from the cleavage in the internal connection between the universal commodity and particular commodities (see: Postone 2000; Lohoff 1998)., LINE: 944, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: particularli time crisi intellectu leadership consist ideolog deriv pseudo explan capit disastr develop cleavag intern connect univers commod particular commod see

TEXT:  In light of the tremendous importance of financial-industry accumulation for today’s overall capitalist process, examination of the mysterious world of the monetary is indispensable for that. On the other hand, as long as the fundamental structure of the prevailing form of socialization (the dissolution of society into isolated private producers) remains hidden behind its material form (money), not only will the analytic scope of the new debate around money remain limited, but it may even provide the material for ideologically regressive approaches to processing the crisis., LINE: 949, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: light tremend import financi industri accumul today overal capitalist process examin mysteri world monetari indispens hand long fundament structur form social dissolut societi isol privat produc remain hidden behind materi form money analyt scope new debat around money remain limit may even provid materi ideolog regress approach crisi

TEXT:  3A commodity that does not manage to enter circulation cannot realize its social relevance. Its value therefore does not exist independently of its circulation.

TEXT:  Rather, the sphere of circulation brings about the transformation of the production of goods into a means for producing value. That is the underlying logic when Marx writes: “There is an antithesis, immanent in the commodity, between use-value and value, between private labor, which must simultaneously manifest itself as directly social labor, and a particular concrete kind of labor which simultaneously counts as merely abstract universal labor, between the conversion of things into persons and the conversion of persons into things; the antithetical phases of the metamorphosis of the commodity are the developed forms of motion of this immanent contradiction” (Marx 1990, 209)., LINE: 966, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: rather sphere circul transform product good mean valu underli logic antithesi imman commod use valu valu privat labor must simultan manifest directli social labor particular concret kind labor simultan count mere abstract univers labor convers thing person convers person thing antithet phase metamorphosi commod form motion imman contradict
TEXT:  4In Capital, he writes the following: “Everyone knows, if nothing else, that commodities have a value-form … I refer to the money-form. Now, however, we have to perform a task … That is, we have to show the origin of this money-form, we have to trace the development of the expression of value contained in the value-relation of commodities from its simplest, almost imperceptible outline to the dazzling money-form., LINE: 967, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: capit follow everyon know noth els commod valu form refer money form howev perform task show origin money form trace develop express valu valu relat commod almost impercept outlin money form
TEXT:  When this has been done, the mystery of money will immediately disappear” (Marx 1990, 139). 5Even an author like Schumpeter believes this—and he is one of the few notable bourgeois economists who has rigorously and, in general, quite sympathetically engaged with Marx., LINE: 968, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: ha done mysteri money immedi disappear even author like belief one notabl bourgeoi economist ha rigor gener quit sympathet engag

TEXT:  It was only in international payment transactions that he regarded the money commodity (gold, at the time) as irreplaceable in the event of disparities in the balance of payments: “Symbolical money or credit money … can function as means of purchase and means of payment in place of the precious metals in domestic circulation, but not on the world market” (Marx 1970: 166–167)., LINE: 978, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: wa intern payment transact money commod gold time irreplac event dispar balanc payment symbol money credit money function mean purchas mean payment place preciou metal domest circul world market

TEXT:  15I use the phrase “money creation” here only because it is an established term. As should already be clear from the text above, it obscures the actual context.

TEXT:  What they get instead is money that has been transformed into monetary capital from the outset, given that the money is lent at a corresponding interest rate.

TEXT: 2.2 Monetary Mechanisms: Origins, Dynamics and Crisis1 Tobias Aufderheide-Kohl Introduction A functioning society without money is an intriguing idea.

TEXT:  The utopia of a sociality without monetary relations that preserves Western standards of living—preferably involving the total inclusion, in principle, of all people in a system offering the unconditional possibility to satisfy one’s needs—appears all the more attractive, inasmuch as the current, nearly global, economic system based on money displays—as will be shown—an inherent, irreducible, tendency to crisis., LINE: 989, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: utopia social without monetari relat preserv western standard live prefer total inclus principl peopl system offer uncondit possibl satisfi one need attract inasmuch current nearli global econom system base money display shown inher irreduc tendenc crisi
TEXT:  This tendency makes the collapse of monetary systems in all historical cycles merely a matter of time. At the same time, however, the global economic system is characterized by an unprecedented power of innovation and productivity and it creates a never-before-seen level of material prosperity for a minority—and this too (as will be shown), it does as a result of a logic inherent to the economy., LINE: 990, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: tendenc make collaps monetari system histor cycl mere matter time time howev global econom system unpreced power innov product never seen level materi prosper minor shown doe result logic inher economi

TEXT:  These include not only credit relations between creditor and debtor, but also purchase and rent, as well as abiding labor relations in organizations.

TEXT:  In conclusion, we will consider the consequences for a post-monetary society. The guiding questions of the sections to follow are: •What is money? How did it come into being and is its origination still instructive for the understanding of money today? If not from a supposedly natural urge to barter, how do markets come into being? •What are the current real practices through which money comes into being and ceases to exist? •How does the economy function as a monetary system? What is the logic of this type of material reproduction?4 •What forms of crises and destabilization result from this process? •What relationships result from this system? What types of actions, which were previously entirely unthinkable, can now develop? What is the “contribution” of money to the coordination of the global system?

TEXT:  What Is Money? Genesis of the Monetary Economy5 Money is elementary and ubiquitous in our society—its understanding, however, is not. The dominant theory’s conception of money—namely, that of the neoclassical school and its off-shoots—as a neutral means of exchange is a fatal mistake, based on the historical speculations of distinguished pioneers of economics6 who were not able to draw on the extensive historical, ethnographic and anthropological knowledge on the subject that we have today., LINE: 997, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: money genesi monetari economi money elementari ubiquit societi understand howev domin theori concept money name school shoot neutral mean exchang fatal mistak base histor specul distinguish pioneer econom abl draw extens histor ethnograph anthropolog knowledg subject today
TEXT:  Accordingly, in neoclassical economics, money appears, for the most part, as a “veil” that has to be torn away, in order to recognize the supposedly true economic relationships: the exchange of goods and services by utility-maximizing rational actors on the basis of initial endowments., LINE: 998, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: accordingli econom money part veil ha torn away order recogn supposedli true econom relationship exchang good servic util ration actor basi initi endow

TEXT:  In any case, with their assumptions of unequal initial endowments, the propensity to exchange, the associated calculative rationality, etc., economists presuppose what needs to be explained. There is no ethnographic or anthropological evidence that there ever existed this kind of “nucleus” of economic activity, in the form of rational optimizers of resource combinations, assumed by the economists., LINE: 1000, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: case assumpt unequ initi endow propens exchang associ calcul ration economist presuppos need ethnograph anthropolog evid ever kind nucleu econom activ form ration resourc combin assum economist

TEXT:  The assumption of the universal resource-holder who is willing to exchange is a functionalist fallacy of economists that has, in the meanwhile, to be called untenable.

TEXT:  Contemporary approaches from areas other than economics or the social sciences offer alternatives. Thus, they treat money, for instance, as a medium that conveys information—which is here an insufficiently precise and too unspecific starting point—or a symbol of value, which is akin to the idea of money as universal commodity (of exchange)., LINE: 1003, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: contemporari approach area econom social scienc offer altern thu treat money instanc medium inform insuffici precis unspecif start point symbol valu akin idea money univers commod exchang
TEXT:  Other approaches have a try at giving more concise definitions: for instance, of money as everything that, in addition to its function as medium of exchange, also functions as means of payment and store of value; or money as claim, promise of payment, credit or also title to property, as defended by Heinsohn and Steiger ([1996] 2006a) in their still significant and pioneering work Eigentum, Zins und Geld (Property, Interest and Money)., LINE: 1004, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: approach tri give concis definit instanc money everyth addit function medium exchang also function mean payment store valu money claim promis payment credit also titl properti still signific work geld properti interest money
TEXT: 9 The historically best arguments suggest understanding money as a levy good defined by a state authority: hence, as a means of debt redemption.

TEXT:  According to Schmandt-Besserath (1992), the requisite instruments, like payment systems (“tokens”) and statistics, predate writing.

TEXT:  The levy good serving to settle the debts does not have to have any value of its own and can also be exclusively created by the ruler.

TEXT:  Like Heinsohn and Steiger (2006a: 323), the chartalist theory of power thus views the market as a derivative phenomenon, not as the naturally emerging expression of the homo economicus. The roots of money thus lie in taxes, levies and tributes, which are wrested from a dominated population or group by way of organized violence, mostly in order to finance the coercive apparatus of the military., LINE: 1011, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: like theori power thu view market deriv phenomenon natur express homo root money thu lie tax levi tribut domin popul group way organ violenc mostli order financ coerciv apparatu militari

TEXT:  In modern states or currency areas, the money found in circulation is the result of a two-tier banking system with the central bank as its institutional center.

TEXT: 19 This money is only indirectly provided to credit-seeking private actors or the state via private commercial banks. These banks are guided by the profit motive. Now, contrary to a widespread misunderstanding, these commercial banks do not receive the money by acquiring it in the form of loans from the central bank, but rather by providing collateral to the central bank under legally precisely determined conditions., LINE: 1021, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: money indirectli provid credit seek privat actor state via privat commerci bank bank profit motiv contrari widespread commerci bank receiv money form loan central bank rather provid collater central bank legal precis determin condit

TEXT:  In return, the central bank monetizes the title against a fee that it has established (the discount rate): it thus gives the commercial bank money for the contractually determined period up to the redemption., LINE: 1023, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: return central bank titl fee ha establish discount rate thu give commerci bank money contractu determin period redempt
TEXT:  The discount rate is not interest, but a money tax; accordingly, following deduction of the expenses of the central bank, it is also transferred to the state as “profit.” The central bank is thus not to be understood as a bank, but rather, to use a pointed formulation, as the unique instance in a currency area that, in accordance with definite rules, makes money out of (certain) paper and accounting processes and paper out of money., LINE: 1024, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: discount rate interest money tax accordingli follow deduct expens central bank also transfer state profit central bank thu understood bank rather use point formul uniqu instanc currenc area accord definit rule make money certain paper account process paper money

TEXT:  It is thus a sort of alchemist and anti-alchemist at the same time, which, by way of definite procedures, makes “gold” out of worthless material and worthless material out of “gold.”20 The common opinion that the business of banks consists of accepting interest-bearing deposits from savers and loaning these in turn—for instance, to entrepreneurs—at a higher rate of interest, is hence misleading., LINE: 1026, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: thu sort alchemist anti alchemist time way definit procedur make gold worthless materi worthless materi gold common opinion busi bank interest bear deposit saver turn instanc entrepreneur higher rate interest henc mislead
TEXT:  Banks do not provide credit by loaning money, but rather by granting the borrower (sight-)deposits in an account at their bank. As a rule, these titles to money that are accorded by the bank are described as deposit money: a concept that is, on the one hand, infelicitous, since it is precisely not a matter of money—just as little as a theater ticket is a performance, to paraphrase Keynes21—but, on the other hand, is understandable, since the relinquishment of titles to money between bank customers—better known as transfers22—are accepted as payment exactly as if one had received the money in cash., LINE: 1027, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: bank provid credit money rather borrow sight deposit account bank rule titl money bank deposit money concept one hand infelicit sinc precis matter money littl theater ticket perform paraphras hand understand sinc relinquish titl money bank custom better known transfer accept payment exactli one receiv money cash
TEXT:  It follows from these basic processes, that for all sight deposits (titles to money), as well as money, there are claims of the same amount plus interest: at least plus the discount rate (as the basis of the private interest rate) as public tax on issuing money., LINE: 1028, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: basic process sight deposit titl money well money claim amount plu interest least plu discount rate basi privat interest rate public tax issu money
TEXT:  The deposits accorded by banks are many times greater than the money issued—and are also not subject to any indirect control by the central bank.23 On the aggregate, the deposits equal the debt. Hence, a bank “creates” no money, but, at most, credit; it produces no money and also does not lend any, but rather it accords titles to money., LINE: 1029, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: deposit bank mani time greater money also subject indirect control central bank aggreg deposit equal debt henc bank money credit produc money also doe lend rather accord titl money
TEXT:  This money-denominated documentation of monetary claims is always prior to the appearance of “new” money in the two-tier banking system.24 3. Economic Dynamics If all deposits are based on debt and all debt is burdened with interest and (in part) a money tax (the discount rate), hence if, as a whole, more must be repaid as there is in circulation and economic actors, moreover, withdraw money from circulation by way of retaining profits, then the economy is a kind of chain letter: a Ponzi scheme., LINE: 1030, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: money document monetari claim alway prior appear new money two tier bank system econom dynam deposit base debt debt interest part money tax discount rate henc whole must circul econom actor moreov withdraw money circul way retain profit economi kind chain letter scheme
TEXT:  Paul C. Martin (1988, 1990) has developed this idea in the most consistent fashion. On his account, the dynamic of the capitalist system—or, as he puts it, the “debtist” system—is based on the fact that debtors are always under pressure to repay their loans and, to this end, are always dependent on new debtors to settle their debt and therefore later on an even higher level of general debt, in order to assure that these loans too remain serviceable until they come due., LINE: 1031, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: martin ha idea consist fashion account dynam capitalist system put system base fact debtor alway pressur repay loan end alway depend new debtor settl debt therefor later even higher level gener debt order assur loan remain servic come due
TEXT:  Hence, on the level of the economy as a whole, ever greater amounts of new loans are required, in order to repay ever greater old loans, which previously allowed smaller ones to be repaid. On this view, a “natural” equilibrium as a characteristic of economic mechanisms appears downright absurd., LINE: 1032, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: henc level economi whole ever greater amount new loan order repay ever greater old loan previous smaller one view natur equilibrium characterist econom mechan downright absurd
TEXT:  The refinancing problem perpetuates itself over time, which becomes the key parameter in this dynamic system: claims grow over the course of time due to interest; time costs money—and these costs have to be offset by way of these compensatory new debt relations and “new debtors., LINE: 1033, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: problem time becom key paramet dynam system claim grow cours time due interest time cost money cost offset way compensatori new debt relat new debtor
TEXT: ”25 In this context, the observable acceleration of all economic processes (productivity increases, just-in-time production, etc.) appears only logical. Martin thus links up with one of the key theses of Heinsohn (1984: 144): “The interest obligations of borrowers … remain the decisive … basis of the monetary economy., LINE: 1034, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: context observ acceler econom process product increas time product logic martin thu link one key thesi interest oblig borrow remain decis basi monetari economi
TEXT: ” This existential worry is a burden for both debtor and creditor, as has been pointedly expressed in an aphorism attributed to Baron Rothschild: “If you have 100 pounds of debt, you do not sleep well; if you have 100,000 pounds of debt, your banker does not sleep well., LINE: 1035, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: existenti worri burden debtor creditor ha pointedli express aphor baron pound debt sleep well pound debt banker doe sleep well
TEXT: ”26 This pressure of debt, which, amidst the competition for scarce means of payment, drives innovation and productivity, is what lends the modern economy its peculiar dynamic.

TEXT: 27 From his chain-letter thesis, Martin thus draws the logical consequence from the assumption of an absence of interest, of profit and of all savings in the circulation of money, which would make it at least theoretically possible for debtors to repay their debt, pithily noting: “All of capitalism consists of nothing more than a (to the greatest extent possible) frictionless process of piling up debt” (Martin 1990: 82f., LINE: 1037, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: chain letter thesi martin thu draw logic consequ assumpt absenc interest profit save circul money would make least theoret possibl debtor repay debt pithili capit noth extent possibl frictionless process pile debt martin

TEXT:  The stream of debt does not only flow faster and faster, but also becomes broader.

TEXT:  It is true that, using a simulation, Steve Keen demonstrates that the effect of lacking interest payments does not necessarily emerge. He thus takes his distance from the position that is not only defended by Martin, but has been discussed among post-Keynesians for some twenty years now: namely, that not only profits, but (on the assumption of stable quantities) even interest payments appear not to be possible on the level of the economy as a whole (Rochon 2005: 125)., LINE: 1040, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: true simul keen effect interest payment doe necessarili emerg thu take distanc posit martin ha among post twenti year name profit assumpt stabl quantiti even interest payment appear possibl level economi whole
TEXT: 29 Under the strong assumptions of either the consumption or reinvestment of all revenues, Keen shows, drawing on “circuit theory,”30 that the system can be stabilized, which also presupposes that the consumption of bankers (with periodic loan repayment installments) is equal to interest payments., LINE: 1041, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: strong assumpt either consumpt reinvest revenu keen show draw circuit theori system also consumpt banker period loan repay instal equal interest payment
TEXT: 31 New loans are thus only necessary during an expansion and the constantly observable destabilization of the economy has its origin only in them or in an excessive increase—hence, in practice, in the banking system., LINE: 1042, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: new loan thu necessari expans constantli observ economi ha origin excess increas henc practic bank system
TEXT:  Keen’s model is, however an unrealistic representation:32 above all, because in this scenario banks do not pursue any expansion of their own business (instead interest payments flow into consumption) and because it is assumed that the profits of businesses, despite falling returns (which, in the end, tend toward zero), are always reinvested at the same level—to say nothing of the absence of any savings., LINE: 1043, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: keen model howev unrealist represent scenario bank pursu expans busi instead interest payment flow consumpt assum profit busi despit fall return end tend toward zero alway level say noth absenc save

TEXT:  Every (temporary) “stabilization” is based on an expansionary trend, nourished by constant pressure to increase productivity, innovation and, in general, profitability, which is exerted on participants in the economy who want to defend or improve their economic position: for the most part, under the existential pressure of debts (whether an investment loan or next month’s rent)., LINE: 1045, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: everi temporari stabil base expansionari trend constant pressur increas product innov gener profit particip economi want defend improv econom posit part existenti pressur debt whether invest loan next month rent

TEXT:  Thus, the economy does not break out of an equilibrium by virtue of progress, but rather it is in a constant process of growth (Binswanger 2006: 300). The “active economy” does not exist, but only the myriad of either intertemporally mutually supporting or disappointing decisions to invest now, later or not at all, to save, to take out a loan, to purchase, to rent, and, from the perspective of banks, to provide loans at all., LINE: 1053, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: thu economi doe break equilibrium virtu progress rather constant process growth activ economi doe exist myriad either mutual support disappoint decis invest later save take loan purchas rent perspect bank provid loan

TEXT:  The only alternative would be contraction.37 Expanded capacities (investment) make profits possible—and thereby also “accumulation”—but they also themselves require more monetary demand, which can only be established by way of new credit relations and are thereby simultaneously countered by the amassing of unconsumed monetary assets and fortunes which are no longer in the monetary circuit or only by means of financial assets., LINE: 1055, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: altern would contract expand capac invest make profit possibl therebi also accumul also requir monetari demand establish way new credit relat therebi simultan unconsum monetari asset fortun longer monetari circuit mean financi asset
TEXT:  In his model of a “growth spiral,” which is driven by compulsion to grow and propensity to grow, Hans Christoph Binswanger neatly summarizes these findings and combines them with an ecological consideration of resources and energy, while including the “productive factors” of imagination and creativity (Binswanger 2006, 2009; Dorfner et al., LINE: 1056, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: model growth spiral driven compuls grow propens grow han neatli find combin ecolog consider resourc energi product factor imagin creativ
TEXT:  1994; Binswanger et al. 1978).38 Businesses, which “owe” debt-servicing at least in outside capital and dividends in their own capital, transform money into capital and are thereby ab ovo subject to the profit expectation as condition of their existence and as compensation for the risk taken in the pre-financing of production., LINE: 1057, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: busi owe debt least outsid capit dividend capit transform money capit therebi subject profit expect condit exist compens risk taken product
TEXT:  As opposed to households, subsistence does not suffice for their explanation. (Family-owned businesses and other owner-run firms represent an exception, in which this can occur.)

TEXT:  “This mean that the growth of net profits and interest must, minimally, correspond to the growth of capital and, vice-versa, that the growth in the volume of money to which the growth of capital gives rise must be sufficiently great to allow for the corresponding growth in net profits and in interest, which together comprise corporate profit” (Binswanger 2006: 315)., LINE: 1059, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: mean growth net profit interest must minim correspond growth capit vice growth volum money growth capit give rise must suffici great allow correspond growth net profit interest togeth compris corpor profit

TEXT: 39 The historical changes that heralded this turbo-charging of growth into an upwards spiral economy were the creation of credit and the use of fossil fuels (Binswanger 2006: 309).

TEXT:  “In a capitalist economy, profits motivate and reward business; they function to validate the past and induce the future” (Minsky [1986] 2008b: 191). If positive expectations predominate, a deviation-reinforcing feedback process (positive feedback) of profit expectations, investment, assets, and actual profit is thus established, which can result in a self-fulfilling prophecy of increased prosperity., LINE: 1065, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: capitalist economi profit motiv reward busi function valid past induc futur posit expect predomin deviat feedback process posit feedback profit expect invest asset actual profit thu establish result self propheci prosper
TEXT:  Credit is the engine of prosperity in capitalism. It powers a time-machine with which we travel into the future. There, we pick the fruits of tomorrow, in order to enjoy them already today.

TEXT:  Financial market capitalism of the current sort thus involves a complicated, both forward and backward, linking of past, present and future.41 Thus, in credit, not only is “tomorrow made available today,” but thanks to it, the conditions for tomorrow are created today, with the aim of being able to redeem one’s debts in the future present., LINE: 1069, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: financi market capit current sort thu complic forward backward link past present futur thu credit tomorrow made avail today thank condit tomorrow today aim abl redeem one debt futur present

TEXT:  The willingness to finance investment is often based on the calculation “that the existing state of affairs will continue indefinitely” (Keynes 1936: 152).42 Like hardly anyone else, Minsky was able to make clear how false this assumption turns out to be and the consequences that follow: “But in truth neither the boom, nor the debt deflation, nor the stagnation, and certainly not a recovery or full-employment growth can continue indefinitely., LINE: 1071, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: willing financ invest often base calcul state affair continu indefinit like hardli anyon els wa abl make clear fals assumpt turn consequ follow truth neither boom debt deflat stagnat certainli recoveri full employ growth continu indefinit
TEXT:  Each state nurtures forces that lead to its own destruction” (Minsky [1975] 2008a: 126; author’s emphasis).

TEXT:  There are no attractors leading toward a static state of balance, but rather a dynamic based on expectations and a related use of “assets” to take out and use loans. As long as the “chain letter” continues to be passed on—hence, as long as new debtors are found, who, on the expectation of future prosperity, allow the current debtors to repay—a favorable investment climate prevails, which hardly permits any doubt to arise about precisely the well-foundedness of these expectations., LINE: 1073, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: attractor lead toward static state balanc rather dynam base expect relat use asset take use loan long chain letter henc long new debtor found expect futur prosper allow current debtor repay favor invest climat hardli permit doubt aris precis well expect
TEXT:  But if assessments—whether of banks (lenders) or entrepreneurs (borrowers)—about the future are more pessimistic or investment is being made in other places in the “globalized” world—hence, if local investment falls and is also not offset by foreign demand, public deficits or consumer debt43—then investors’ yield expectations are disappointed and, along with liquidity, the required upwards tendency is also endangered: loans become non-performing; “haircuts” (reductions in the value of collateral) and “margin calls” (calls for additional collateral) threaten to spoil the previously favorable climate., LINE: 1074, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: assess whether bank lender entrepreneur borrow futur pessimist invest made place world henc local invest fall also offset foreign demand public deficit consum debt investor yield expect disappoint along liquid upward tendenc also loan becom non haircut reduct valu collater margin call call addit collater threaten spoil previous favor climat

TEXT:  Like the preceding boom, this sets in motion a spiral of positive feedback, only this time in the opposite direction: reinforcing and fulfilling itself in the direction of gloomy future prospects and money destruction, since more debts are repaid or written off than new loans are provided., LINE: 1076, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: like preced boom set motion spiral posit feedback time opposit direct direct gloomi futur prospect money destruct sinc debt written new loan provid
TEXT:  A debt deflation44 begins. On the stock market, it then becomes apparent that stocks that served as collateral for loans and the basis for a “wealth effect” were not only bets in a zero-sum game in which the one player wins what the other loses, and hence the total amount is always zero., LINE: 1077, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: debt deflat begin stock market becom appar stock collater loan basi wealth effect bet zero sum game one player win henc total amount alway zero
TEXT:  Rather, it needs to be acknowledged that, in principle, just one single unsold share can make the price fall so much that all holders have to undertake adjustments in their balance sheets that could create liquidity problems for them: they lack “borrowing power” (Minsky [1986] 2008b: 208)., LINE: 1078, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: rather need acknowledg principl one singl unsold share make price fall much holder undertak adjust balanc sheet could creat liquid problem lack borrow power

TEXT:  What is meant by the marginal productivity of debt is the ratio of the change in GNP to change in debt as an expression of the effect that an additional unit of debt has on value creation.46 At the end of an increasingly complex system of debt, deflationary effects arise even with increasing debt, since greater and greater sums go into debt servicing, whereas consumption declines., LINE: 1082, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: meant margin product debt ratio chang chang debt express effect addit unit debt ha valu creation end increasingli complex system debt deflationari effect aris even increas debt sinc greater greater sum debt wherea consumpt declin

TEXT: ) Irving Fisher’s continuing (public) misjudgments of the share price trend did not only cost him his fortune.

TEXT:  The theory remained almost completely ignored until the 1980s. In it, Fischer (1933) provided a groundbreaking theory about how to understand the basic mechanisms of crisis in monetary economies. What is key here is the implosion of a credit bubble with a series of self-reinforcing factors, resulting in a downward spiral in Binswanger’s sense., LINE: 1088, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: theori almost complet provid theori understand basic mechan crisi monetari economi key implos credit bubbl seri self factor result downward spiral sens
TEXT:  Per Fisher (1933: 342),50 starting from a situation of over-indebtedness, the crisis develops in a circle of falling prices and fire sales, from which there results a further decline in prices, etc. In this mechanism of deflationary positive feedback, it remains an open question where the starting point is to be found., LINE: 1089, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: per fisher start situat indebted crisi circl fall price fire sale result declin price mechan deflationari posit feedback remain open question start point found
TEXT:  In his financial instability hypothesis, Minsky, drawing on what he regarded as Keynes’s revolutionary insight, saw it in stability itself: stability is inherently destabilizing. He identifies the reason for this in the uncertainty and the conditions of financial relations and expectations (Dymski and Pollin 1992: 36)., LINE: 1090, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: financi instabl hypothesi draw revolutionari insight saw stabil stabil inher reason uncertainti condit financi relat expect

TEXT:  In Keynes’s theory, by contrast, they were already normal events: not exogenous disturbances in the “boom and bust,”51 but rather features inherent to the economy.52 The expansionary logic of the upswing is the only way in which the modern economy can maintain its level: “We are dealing with a system that is inherently unstable, and the fundamental instability is ‘upward’ ” (Minsky [1975] 2008a: 162)., LINE: 1093, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: theori contrast alreadi normal event exogen disturb boom bust rather featur inher economi expansionari logic upsw way modern economi maintain level deal system inher unstabl fundament instabl upward
TEXT:  In Minsky’s interpretation, the boom is the decisive factor. On the basis of the boom, economic actors take on more burdensome liabilities in relation to future income. The projected yields from capital assets are uncertain and determined via market processes; the debt service, on the other hand, is nominally fixed., LINE: 1094, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: interpret boom decis factor basi boom econom actor take burdensom liabil relat futur incom yield capit asset uncertain determin via market process debt servic hand nomin fix

TEXT:  In an uncertain world, in which one is neither entirely clear about the past nor can predict the future, investments necessarily have a speculative character (Minsky [1975] 2008a: 75 and 140). It is the upswing and the boom phase that typically produce risky behavior., LINE: 1096, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: uncertain world one neither entir clear past predict futur invest necessarili specul charact upsw boom phase typic produc riski behavior
TEXT:  Stability thus has a destabilizing effect.

TEXT: 54 Thus, after the Great Depression and the Second World War, the leading industrial powers—all of them, apart from the USA, having been devastated by the war—developed with high growth rates and an extremely robust financial structure, in which financial innovations and financial speculation were still kept to a minimum within the Bretton Woods system., LINE: 1101, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: thu great depress second world war lead industri power apart war high growth rate extrem robust financi structur financi innov financi specul still kept minimum within wood system
TEXT:  A relatively equal distribution of wealth prevailed,55 and there were high growth rates on the basis of productive debt. Starting in the 1960s, the ratio of debt to income grew constantly: in the USA in 1981, the private sector (private households, financial companies and other businesses) had debts representing 123 percent of gross national product; in 2008, they already represented 290 percent., LINE: 1102, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: rel equal distribut wealth high growth rate basi product debt start ratio debt incom grew constantli privat sector privat household financi compani busi debt percent gross nation product alreadi percent

TEXT:  The source of these debts is, to a considerable extent, states, which increasingly stepped in as assumers of debt in the most recent financial crises: using their deficits to replace, to a large degree, the otherwise cyclically eroding demand or using bailouts directly to prevent the insolvency of major (financial) companies and, thus, to socialize losses., LINE: 1106, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: sourc debt consider extent state increasingli step debt recent financi crisi deficit replac larg degre otherwis cyclic demand directli prevent insolv major financi compani thu social loss

TEXT:  4There are unquestionably other types of material reproduction that should not be called “economy” here.

TEXT:  7For example, this is how one of the deans of economic theory, the Nobel Prize winner Paul Samuelson (1973), presents matters in his textbook on economics. 8There is an extensive body of literature by researchers who show that it was not exchange and the market to which money owes its existence and by authors drawing on them, who demonstrate how money must be derived rather from relationships of debt or how money is connected to the emergence of the state, the legal system (fines) or religious centers., LINE: 1220, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: exampl one dean econom theori prize winner present matter textbook econom extens bodi literatur research show wa exchang market money exist author draw demonstr money must deriv rather relationship debt money connect emerg state legal system fine religi center
TEXT:  Graeber (2011a, 2011b) and Sahlins (1972) argue against the neoclassical version from an ethnographic and anthropological perspective.

TEXT:  Polanyi (1957, 1968, [1944] 2001) makes this clear for feudal systems as well. Crawford (1970), Dalton (1965, 1967, 1971, 1982), and Frazer ([1890] 1996) have shown that in tribal societies, it is not exchange, but rather particular socio-institutional structures that regulate production., LINE: 1222, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: make clear feudal system well dalton frazer shown tribal societi exchang rather particular institut structur regul product
TEXT:  For refutation of the existence of a market economy in feudalism, see, above all, Bloch (1961: 67), Heinsohn and Steiger (Heinsohn 1983, 1984; Heinsohn and Steiger 1981, 1989, 1999, 2006a, 2006b). Wray (1998, 2002, 2004, 2005) and Martin (2001, 2003, 2008) also take up this point: they make the important suggestion to replace the exchange paradigm by the property paradigm and they distinguish between three different forms of material reproduction—solidarity, command and property societies—of which only the latter is regarded as an economy., LINE: 1223, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: refut exist market economi feudal see martin also take point make import suggest replac exchang paradigm properti paradigm distinguish three differ form materi reproduct solidar command properti societi latter economi
TEXT:  Hoppe and Langton (1994) consider the nineteenth century. Goodhart (1989, 1998) makes a chartalist argument, which is also based on the numismatic perspective of Kraay (1964), Grierson (1959, 1977, 1978, 1979) and Cook (1958)., LINE: 1224, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: consid nineteenth centuri make argument also base numismat perspect cook

TEXT:  On fundamental matters, Mitchell Innes (1913) and Keynes (1930).

TEXT:  According to the latter, money emerged from jewelry and symbols of rank: hence as a mixture of gift (Mauss) and power derivative (symbol of rank).

TEXT:  4). 15Of course, there can also be a feeling of debt arising from moral obligation or coerced contributions of a parasitic-mafioso sort. 16Coins constitutes the exception to this rule. They come into being in fact as “net money,” whose volume, however, is severely limited by law and is of little importance in light of the total volume., LINE: 1234, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: cours also feel debt moral oblig contribut parasit sort coin except rule come fact net money whose volum howev sever limit law littl import light total volum
TEXT:  17See the instructive presentation by Enghofer and Knospe (2005). The following presentation is, in part, adopted from Kohl (2014: 361ff.). 18Money has here to be distinguished from means of payment, since monetary claims—for instance, in the case of transfers between private actors—are also treated like money, hence as debt-extinguishing., LINE: 1235, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: see instruct present follow present part adopt kohl money ha distinguish mean payment sinc monetari claim instanc case transfer privat actor also like money henc debt

TEXT:  Goethe was undoubtedly one of the first to succeed in representing modern money creation as a highly particular kind of alchemy. According to Graeber (2011a: 447, note 73) following Wennerlind (2003), in the seventeenth century, most European rulers employed alchemists to try to produce gold and silver for coins., LINE: 1237, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: wa undoubtedli one first succeed modern money creation highli particular kind alchemi accord note follow seventeenth centuri ruler employ alchemist tri produc gold silver coin
TEXT:  It was only after their definitive failure that the era of paper money arrived in Europe. 21He is referring, however, to confusion about the value of money (Keynes 1914: 402). 22In the case of transfers between different banks, the banks have to move around real deposits in their central bank accounts (hence real money); since, however, reciprocal obligations can be balanced in inter-bank transactions as a whole, only a fraction of real money has to be moved around in the overall circulation of titles to money., LINE: 1238, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: wa definit failur era paper money howev confus valu money case transfer differ bank bank move around real deposit central bank account henc real money sinc howev reciproc oblig balanc inter bank transact whole fraction real money ha around overal circul titl money

TEXT:  This leads to the calculation of net asset maximization—and increases “innovative dynamism” and “allocative efficiency.” 28As is well known, Marx was also preoccupied by the question of how surplus-value comes into being., LINE: 1242, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: lead calcul net asset maxim increas innov dynam effici well known wa also preoccupi question surplu valu come

TEXT:  29See too Bruun and Heyn-Johnsen (2009). 30In this theory, monetary circuits are modeled and “endogenous money” is taken as point of departure.

TEXT:  also Parguez and Seccareccia (2000) and Cahen-Fourot and Lavoie (2016). 31Keen’s model is thus based on an additive model with strong assumptions, in which revenues always entirely become expenditures within credit periods (Keen 2010: 20)., LINE: 1245, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: also keen model thu base addit model strong assumpt revenu alway entir becom expenditur within credit period keen
TEXT:  32Keen himself does not claim it is realistic. From this model, he derives a crisis theory that is strongly influenced by Minsky. Under the evolutionary conditions of economic activity in modern complex society, the avoidance of an unequal distribution of assets and capital remains illusory—just like an equal distribution of power, knowledge, and access., LINE: 1246, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: keen doe claim realist model crisi theori strongli evolutionari condit econom activ modern complex societi avoid unequ distribut asset capit remain illusori like equal distribut power knowledg access
TEXT:  The peculiarities of a relatively novel social system—organizations—further exacerbate this problem. 33Based on a passage from Lewis Carroll’s Alice in Wonderland. 34Very much in the spirit of Schumpeter, he sees creative entrepreneurs as heroes., LINE: 1247, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: peculiar rel novel social system organ exacerb problem base passag lewi wonderland much spirit see creativ entrepreneur hero
TEXT:  In this regard, his arguments go in more or less the same direction as Heinsohn and Steiger (2006a: 337, 362ff.).

TEXT:  37According to Minsky (1982), a crisis in the form of the Great Depression has been hitherto prevented by public or central bank intervention—or, in other words, by “big government.” 38Earlier post-Keynesian approaches come from Harrod (1934) and Domar (1946)., LINE: 1250, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: accord crisi form great depress ha hitherto public central bank intervent word big govern post approach come
TEXT:  39It is clear that this is not a characterization of a universal property of systems of material reproduction.

TEXT:  Depending on how one conceptualizes money, very different views on questions of a possible post-monetary society result. I want first briefly to survey the field.

TEXT:  The various “form-critical” and “fetishism-critical” interpretations, which circulate under descriptions like “value critique” (Krisis), “monetary value theory” (cf.

TEXT:  Backhaus 2011), can be distinguished from this traditional version (b). Without wanting to suppress the differences among them, I would formulate what is common among these latter strands as follows: Money or monetary forms are attributed a key position in modern society or in capitalist economy, whereas in the traditional Marxist interpretation, they are often regarded as a kind of appendage of the (labor-value theoretical, production-centered) so-called real economy., LINE: 1273, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: distinguish tradit version without want suppress differ among would formul common among latter strand money monetari form key posit modern societi capitalist economi wherea tradit interpret often kind appendag labor valu theoret product center real economi
TEXT:  In the form-critical interpretations, money—or, more exactly, generalized monetary circulation—is attributed a specific logic. It possesses its own dynamic and—in combination with a sphere of production that is also capitalistically organized—generates characteristics like the compulsions to grow and turn a profit, as well as crisis tendencies., LINE: 1274, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: form critic interpret money exactli gener monetari circul specif logic dynam combin sphere product also organ characterist like compuls grow turn profit well crisi tendenc
TEXT:  In the case of the conceptualization of money as medium, the situation is also relatively complex.

TEXT:  For the “money as medium” nexus, I would, to start with, distinguish at least three different discursive lines: On the one hand, there is the association of a medium with the idea of neutrality (c). A medium precisely only mediates, but it does not itself possess any structure-forming potential., LINE: 1276, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: money medium nexu would start distinguish least three differ discurs line one hand associ medium idea neutral medium precis doe possess structur form potenti
TEXT:  If one thinks of money in this way as a medium, then one finds oneself in direct proximity to neoclassical economics, in which there is also the idea (which is deeply embedded in the corresponding theoretical structure of equilibrium theory) that money is only a veil and, ultimately, economically neutral., LINE: 1277, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: one think money way medium one find oneself direct proxim econom also idea deepli correspond theoret structur equilibrium theori money veil ultim econom neutral
TEXT:  From the latter, we can distinguish, firstly, the sociological discourse about money as a symbolically-generalized medium of communication (Luhmann [1988] 1994: 230–271; Luhmann refers to Talcott Parsons, who already early on described money as a medium) (d)., LINE: 1278, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: latter distinguish firstli sociolog discours money symbol gener medium commun parson alreadi earli money medium

TEXT:  Thirdly and lastly, we have the newer media theories (e): studies that are often in the tradition of Kittler or that at least critically refer to Kittler.

TEXT:  On the other hand, there is hardly any treatment of money coming from these quarters—at least, there is little of which I am aware. Perhaps we can proceed as follows: Ernst first gives us a couple of bars on the Marxian conception of money as the commodity that has been set apart from other commodities and Jens gives us a couple on the agenda of media theory? So that from the start we can have clearer contours regarding the possible lines of conflict and questions with which we are dealing?

TEXT:  This is, however, incompatible with the prevailing conception of money in economics. In the case of the neoclassical theory that sets the tone, this is immediately obvious.

TEXT:  The question of what gives money its character as an autonomous social power cannot even be formulated on this basis. It has already been defined away in the monetary-theoretical premises. If one takes off the traditional Marxian glasses in considering the Marxian critique of political economy and takes its fetishism-critical direction seriously, then the core points about the significance of money read like a counter-program to the dominant technicist-functionalist money concept., LINE: 1288, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: question give money charact autonom social power cannot even basi ha alreadi defin away monetari theoret premis one take tradit glass consid critiqu polit economi take fetish critic direct serious core point signific money read like counter program domin technicist functionalist money concept
TEXT:  As “true power and the sole end” (Marx 1964: 155), money, on the basis of the capitalist mode of production, represents a social absolute for Marx. Per the critique of political economy, money does not only have social influence, “[money] is itself the community, and can tolerate none other standing above it” (Marx 1973: 223)., LINE: 1289, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: true power sole end money basi capitalist mode product social absolut per critiqu polit economi money doe social influenc money commun toler none stand
TEXT:  Someone hearing such formulations for the first time might be reminded of sayings like “money rules the world” or “money spoils one’s character.” Did Marx thus provide a theoretical foundation to the periodic moaning of ordinary everyday understanding about the power of money?

TEXT:  Money as “the real community” is “the common product of all” (Marx 1973: 225–226; translation modified).

TEXT:  The modern commodity subject can carry around “his bond with society in his pocket” (Marx 1973: 157)—a feat that is unimaginable in every other social formation. Marx coined the term “money fetish” for the transformation of the social bond into a universal social thing., LINE: 1294, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: modern commod subject carri around bond societi pocket feat unimagin everi social format term money fetish transform social bond univers social thing

TEXT:  In the capitalist mode of production, people leave it to their products to create their social relationship—which is what makes these products into commodities. People’s products are thereby already transformed from simple useful goods into “sensate supra-sensate or social things” (Marx [1867] 1983: 637)., LINE: 1296, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: capitalist mode product peopl leav product creat social relationship make product commod peopl product therebi alreadi simpl use good sensat sensat social thing

TEXT:  The “magic of money” (Marx 1976: 187) comes from this dual character of the commodity that makes it, at the same time, both a particular use-value and the representative of value in general. “The definition of a product as exchange value thus necessarily implies,” namely, that exchange value obtains a separate existence, in isolation from the product., LINE: 1298, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: magic money come dual charact commod make time particular use valu repres valu gener definit product exchang valu thu necessarili name exchang valu separ exist isol product
TEXT:  The exchange value which is separated from commodities and exists alongside them as itself a commodity, this is—money.

TEXT:  Adam Smith, the founding father of classical political economy, already situated money outside of the world of commodities: outside of actual capitalist wealth. Inasmuch as Marx interprets money in terms of the critique of fetishism and grasps it as the social form of existence of exchange-value that has become its own immediately social thing, he makes a logical break from this two-world theory., LINE: 1301, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: smith found father classic polit economi alreadi situat money outsid world commod outsid actual capitalist wealth inasmuch money term critiqu fetish grasp social form exist exchang valu ha becom immedi social thing make logic break two world theori

TEXT:  In certain functions—for instance, in that of medium of circulation—money, the “independent value shape of commodities” (Marx [1867] 1983: 76), can “be replaced by mere symbols of itself” (Marx 1976: 185)., LINE: 1303, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: certain function instanc medium circul money independ valu shape commod mere symbol
TEXT:  And this is in turn the basis of the idea, which was already widespread in the nineteenth century, that money is itself nothing more than a token or symbol.

TEXT: ” But he only made this concession, in order to reject the contents of the symbol theory, the mystification of money as a non-commodity, in the very next sentence: “In this sense every commodity is a symbol, since, as value, it is only the material shell of the human labor expended on it” (Marx 1976: 185)., LINE: 1306, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: made concess order reject content symbol theori mystif money non commod next sentenc sens everi commod symbol sinc valu materi shell human labor
TEXT:  For Marx, all commodities represent “social ciphers”—the money-commodity included, of course.

TEXT:  The usual understanding reserves the concept of symbol for money and treats the opposition between money and commodity as an opposition between symbol of wealth and real tangible content of wealth.

TEXT:  It is for this reason that the picture of a pipe can be neither stuffed nor smoked and painted jam pastries do not fill us up. But the division between money and commodity precisely does not result from the substantive distinction between symbol and object, but is the outcome rather of a completely different logic., LINE: 1311, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: reason pictur pipe neither stuf smoke paint jam pastri fill divis money commod precis doe result substant distinct symbol object outcom rather complet differ logic
TEXT:  The peculiar, genuinely social content that is common to all commodities, viz. of being bearers of exchange-value, makes a separate form of presentation of this content indispensable: “Money is the physical medium into which exchange values are dipped, and in which they obtain the form corresponding to their general character” (Marx 1973: 167)., LINE: 1312, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: peculiar genuin social content common commod bearer exchang valu make separ form present content indispens money physic medium exchang valu dip obtain form correspond gener charact

TEXT:  Marx 1973: 162–163 In claiming that ideas are not transformed in language, Marx remained captive to a view that has long since been falsified by linguistic theory.

TEXT:  In money, a process of reduction and abstraction takes place, for which, even with the best intentions, no parallel is to be found in language.

TEXT:  At least the chimera of the neutrality of money, which is widespread in economics, is instantly dissolved, when we grasp money as a medium in the sense of modern media theory. In McLuhan’s day, that media are not to be considered as neutral mediators, but rather play an essential part in determining social reality and perception, may still have represented a groundbreaking insight., LINE: 1321, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: least chimera neutral money widespread econom instantli grasp money medium sens modern medium theori day medium consid neutral mediat rather play essenti part social realiti percept may still insight
TEXT:  Today, it is virtually a commonplace. The question has to be posed, however, of what sort of relation a media-theoretical approach has to the concept of money in the critique of political economy.

TEXT:  From the point of view of a Marxist interpretation that is directed toward the fetishism problem, the criterion that decides whether any opening to media-theoretical positions makes sense or not is, however, clear: Is it possible in the media-theoretical system of reference to take into account the inner connection between commodity and money or does such an approach rather reproduce the deficiencies of the classical symbol theory, such as Marx already thematized them?

TEXT:  1. Introduction: The Unclear Theoretical Situation Firstly: In standard works in monetary theory (e.g. Ingham 2005: xiii–xvi), the definition of money as a sort of commodity is attributed to both neoclassical and Marxist theory and is opposed to other definitions of money as either (a) based on debt/credit or (b) on the state or (c) as unit of account., LINE: 1325, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: introduct unclear theoret situat firstli standard work monetari theori definit money sort commod theori oppos definit money either base debt credit state unit account
TEXT:  The dichotomy that Ernst draws between money as a neutral medium in neoclassical economics (“veil of money”) and as “actual community,” as autonomous social power (perhaps as the “automatic subject” of society), in Marxian theory presupposes a specific, as Hanno says, form-critical (value-critical) reading of Marxian theory, which hardly plays any role in debates in monetary theory., LINE: 1326, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: dichotomi draw money neutral medium econom veil money actual commun autonom social power perhap automat subject societi theori specif say form critic valu critic read theori hardli play role debat monetari theori

TEXT:  Confusingly, however, it does so precisely in the presentation of those approaches in which “money takes its properties from its status as a commodity” (Ingham 2005: xi). This means that for Ingham, the definition of money as medium of exchange goes together precisely with that of money as commodity—which is indeed supported by Ernst’s observation that Marx describes money as a commodity, but also expressis verbis as “the physical medium into which exchange values are dipped” (Marx 1973: 167)., LINE: 1328, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: confusingli howev doe precis present approach money take properti statu commod mean definit money medium exchang go togeth precis money commod inde observ money commod also physic medium exchang valu dip
TEXT:  This means that the opposition between money as commodity (that has been “set apart”) and as medium is already withdrawn on the first page of Ingham’s Concepts of Money and should perhaps not even be drawn., LINE: 1329, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: mean opposit money commod ha set apart medium alreadi withdrawn first page concept money perhap even drawn
TEXT:  (I will come back to this point.) Thirdly: In media theory—to the extent that it is at all possible to come to agreement about what is included in it and what is not—there are, as Hanno correctly notes, at least two camps that can be distinguished: on the one hand, the sociological media theories in which money since at least the 1960s has been understood as medium—in Luhmann ([1988] 1994) then as “symbolically generalized medium of communication”—and which are taken up by authors like Norbert Bolz (2008: 90–100); and, on the other—for lack of more precise concepts—all the rest., LINE: 1330, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: come back point thirdli medium theori extent possibl come agreement includ correctli note least two camp distinguish one hand sociolog medium theori money sinc least ha understood medium symbol gener medium commun taken author like lack precis concept rest
TEXT:  In McLuhan, there is already in 1964 a somewhat strange chapter on money in his classical media-theoretical book Understanding Media; later, Winkler (2004: 36–49), Krämer (2005) and Seitter (2002: 179–196) write a couple of pages on money here and there; Hörisch (1996, 2004, 2011, 2013) even writes a few books on the subject., LINE: 1331, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: alreadi somewhat strang chapter money classic medium theoret book understand medium later write coupl page money even book subject
TEXT:  But one cannot say that money has been a central theme of media theory—especially not in the tradition that Hanno mentions: media archeology of a Kittlerian sort (cf. Rieger 2014). To this extent, a media theory of money remains a desideratum., LINE: 1332, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: one cannot say money ha central theme medium theori especi tradit mention medium sort extent medium theori money remain desideratum

TEXT: —cannot. (It is, in any case, striking that in Ingham’s compendium, there is not a single chapter on media or symbol theories of money.) 2.

TEXT: e. to have exchange-value, is not a property of the object, but rather a property of the “social relationship,” of the “social form.” We can take up precisely this point—while criticizing the fuzziness of these concepts—and ask: How is this “form” realized in a medium?

TEXT:  “Not an atom of matter” distinguishes an apple in a supermarket from, let us say, its double on a tree.

TEXT:  Cameras, security guards, tags, signs that threaten punishment, locked doors at night, etc. are all meant to prevent this from happening.

TEXT:  Firstly: Ernst cites Marx: “In this sense every commodity is a symbol, since, as value, it is only the material shell of the human labor expended on it” (Marx 1976: 185), and he reads this passage as proof that Marx rejected the symbol theory of money as “illusionary., LINE: 1339, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: firstli cite sens everi commod symbol sinc valu materi shell human labor read passag proof symbol theori money illusionari
TEXT: ” For Marx continues: “But if it is declared that the social characteristics assumed by material objects, or the material characteristics assumed by the social determinations of labor on the basis of a definite mode of production, are mere symbols, then it is also declared, at the same time, that these characteristics are the arbitrary product of human reflection” (Marx 1976: 185–186)., LINE: 1340, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: declar social characterist assum materi object materi characterist assum social determin labor basi definit mode product mere symbol also declar time characterist arbitrari product human reflect
TEXT:  I interpret this passage as follows: Marx is right (perhaps without wanting to be so2): Every commodity is a symbol. The apple on the tree is not,3 but as a commodity, it “has” the “value” of “0.99 euros,” inasmuch as a sign that is somehow associated with it presents this price., LINE: 1341, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: interpret passag right perhap without want everi commod symbol appl tree commod ha valu inasmuch sign somehow associ present price
TEXT:  Having an exchange-value means referring to this exchange-value in one way or another (even if it is just a matter of someone saying, “It costs 0.99 euros”). Being a commodity means being connected to a symbol for a certain exchange-value., LINE: 1342, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: exchang valu mean exchang valu one way anoth even matter someon say cost commod mean connect symbol certain exchang valu
TEXT:  A commodity is an object with a use-value that has been made into a medium of exchange-value (or was already produced as such). Ernst is thus right when he criticizes the, as he puts it, “habitual” idea (which perhaps also characterizes neoclassical economics) that only money is symbolic and commodities or “goods” are the “real values” (whatever that is supposed to mean4)—an idea from out of which there also arises the idea that the “unreal,” “purely symbolic” financial industry distorts the “real economy” by being superimposed upon it., LINE: 1343, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: commod object use valu ha made medium exchang valu wa alreadi produc thu right put habitu idea perhap also econom money symbol commod good real valu whatev suppos mean idea also idea unreal pure symbol financi industri real economi superimpos upon
TEXT: 5 Secondly: But this actually has nothing to do with the fact of being a “mere symbol” or an “arbitrary product of human reflection.” As a buyer, it is, namely, difficult for me to change the associated price as I please6 and even resellers have only a limited scope., LINE: 1344, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: secondli actual ha noth fact mere symbol arbitrari product human reflect buyer name difficult chang associ price pleas even limit scope
TEXT:  This is just as difficult as inventing a new word for objects as one pleases (i.e. if I still want to be understood). Perhaps I would indeed like to alter the price—and I can try to remove a label that displays a lower price from somewhere and to stick it on the apple., LINE: 1345, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: difficult new word object one still want understood perhap would inde like alter price tri remov label display lower price somewher stick appl
TEXT:  But such practices are not only hindered by the material constitution of current price tags (they get ruined), but also by the laws, which are imposed by force, if necessary. This introduces an aspect into the question concerning money that Ernst does not explicitly mention: the state., LINE: 1346, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: practic materi constitut current price tag get ruin also law forc necessari aspect question concern money doe explicitli mention state
TEXT:  One does not need to claim that money only comes into being by government fiat (I address the difficult question of the genesis of money below); but, in any case, each current mode of appearance of money is stabilized by the state and, if necessary, revoked., LINE: 1347, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: one doe need claim money come govern fiat address difficult question genesi money case current mode appear money state necessari
TEXT: 7 When state power collapses (and no private structures take its place), looting occurs, since price tags, check-out counters and cameras can no longer prevent commodities—which are then no longer commodities—from being taken without being exchanged for money., LINE: 1348, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: state power collaps privat structur take place sinc price tag check counter camera longer prevent commod longer commod taken without money
TEXT:  This is why being the bearer of a symbol does not mean being a “mere symbol,” since the price is a symbol that is stabilized with extreme violence. Hence, to describe money as a symbolic system does not necessarily mean “mystifying it as a non-commodity,” as Ernst claims—it can also mean formulating more precisely what actually connects commodity and money., LINE: 1349, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: bearer symbol doe mean mere symbol sinc price symbol extrem violenc henc describ money symbol system doe necessarili mean non commod claim also mean precis actual commod money
TEXT:  One always acts as if being a symbol meant being “only” and “merely” a symbol: as if symbols, their orders and their media-political conditions of stability were not at least a central structural principle of every possible human reality (see the role of language)., LINE: 1350, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: one alway act symbol meant mere symbol symbol order medium polit condit stabil least central structur principl everi possibl human realiti see role languag
TEXT:  3. Setting Apart So, what does it mean then to describe money as “general commodity” (Marx 1973: 146) or as the “independent value shape of commodities” (Marx [1867] 1983: 76)? This can only mean that, so to say, the price tag separates from the apple and circulates as its own value., LINE: 1351, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: set apart doe mean describ money gener commod independ valu shape commod mean say price tag separ appl valu
TEXT:  It can do this, because the value is precisely not in the apple—“not an atom,” as Marx says: Every moment, in calculating, accounting etc., that we transform commodities into value symbols, we fix them as mere exchange values, making abstraction from the matter they are composed of and all their natural qualities., LINE: 1352, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: valu precis appl atom say everi moment calcul account transform commod valu symbol fix mere exchang valu make abstract matter compos natur qualiti
TEXT:  On paper, in the head, this metamorphosis proceeds by means of mere abstraction; but in the real exchange process a real mediation is required, a means to accomplish this abstraction.

TEXT:  Symbols cannot exist without material bearers—a basic assumption of media theory. Thus, “value symbols” historically have different and changing material bearers: from gold coins to bitcoins.8 Or as Marx put it, in media-theoretical terms: “If a symbol is not to be arbitrary, certain conditions are demanded of the material in which it is represented” (Marx 1973: 145)., LINE: 1354, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: symbol cannot exist without materi bearer basic assumpt medium theori thu valu symbol histor differ materi bearer gold coin put medium theoret term symbol arbitrari certain condit materi
TEXT:  A bill is a materially (almost) worthless object that bears a numerical expression and is medially highly secured against counterfeiting. It can be translated into other media: I can exchange a fifty euro bill against fifty one euro coins or an equivalent amount of gold, which I can then deposit in a bank where the 50 euros are virtually credited to my account, etc., LINE: 1355, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: bill materi almost worthless object bear numer express medial highli medium exchang fifti bill fifti one coin equival amount gold deposit bank virtual account
TEXT:  I would like here to take up one of Ernst’s formulations: “In certain functions—for instance, in that of means of circulation—money, the ‘independent value shape of commodities’ (Marx [1867] 1983: 76), can ‘be replaced by mere symbols of itself’ (Marx 1976: 185)., LINE: 1356, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: would like take one formul certain function instanc mean circul money independ valu shape commod mere symbol
TEXT: ” This sounds as if there were cases in which money would not be a symbol and then, as an exception, could also appear as a symbol. But, as Ernst rightly notes, you cannot eat painted jam pastries—things cannot (as a rule) be replaced by symbols., LINE: 1357, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: sound case money would symbol except could also appear symbol rightli note cannot eat paint jam pastri thing cannot rule symbol
TEXT:  If money can be replaced by “mere symbols,” then it must already have been symbolic before.9 This also applies for gold and the forms it takes: for example, as coins. The discussion about metallism and nominalism in the history of money (and in Marx) is complex, and I cannot go into it here., LINE: 1358, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: money mere symbol must alreadi symbol also gold form take exampl coin discuss metal nomin histori money complex cannot
TEXT:  I would, however, like to suggest that gold too was never and is not valuable “in itself” and also does not have any intrinsic value due to the fact that it is so difficult to mine, etc.10 The point is that it combines sufficient scarcity with properties like divisibility, countability and, above all, durability., LINE: 1359, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: would howev like suggest gold wa never valuabl also doe intrins valu due fact difficult mine point combin suffici scarciti properti like divis durabl
TEXT:  As Ernst once put it, it is suitable as “bearer of value,” because a precious metal is chemically relatively stable—the very idea of a currency based on soap bubbles is absurd. Medial stability is evidently not extraneous to money, Gold coins are thus not “intrinsic” money that—as Ernst puts it—“in certain functions, for instance, in that of means of circulation, can ‘be replaced by mere symbols of itself’”—but rather they are a type of symbol that can be translated into another., LINE: 1360, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: put suitabl bearer valu preciou metal chemic rel stabl idea currenc base soap bubbl absurd medial stabil evid extran money gold coin thu intrins money put certain function instanc mean circul mere symbol rather type symbol anoth
TEXT:  No money is more intrinsic than any other. And this is why, as the expansion of capitalist economies required greater quantities of money and the scarcity of gold became a problem, one could at some point also precisely drop gold., LINE: 1361, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: money intrins expans capitalist economi greater quantiti money scarciti gold problem one could point also precis drop gold
TEXT:  Today, the scarcity and stability mechanisms are of a different sort (counterfeiting protection, etc.); and in light of the massive infrastructure in fiber optics, server farms, etc., that is needed for electronic monetary transactions, it is difficult to claim that money has become more “immaterial., LINE: 1362, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: today scarciti stabil mechan differ sort protect light massiv infrastructur fiber optic server farm electron monetari transact difficult claim money ha becom immateri
TEXT: ” Hence, one can conclude that there is no contradiction at all between the description of money as “general commodity” and as “medium”—on the contrary: One can only explain the setting apart of money, by basing it on the symbolic character of commodity and money., LINE: 1363, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: henc one conclud contradict descript money gener commod medium contrari one explain set apart money symbol charact commod money
TEXT:  4. Autonomization Ernst writes: “In money, the social relations of people take on an autonomous objective shape,” and he cites Marx: “The individual carries his social power, as well as his bond with society, in his pocket” (Marx 1973: 157)., LINE: 1364, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: money social relat peopl take autonom object shape cite individu carri social power well bond societi pocket

TEXT:  The point here is that “social relations” take on an autonomous form. Money is not simply a means to an end, but rather its increase (M–C–M’) becomes the main end. Now, one can ask, to begin with, what in fact “social relations” means., LINE: 1366, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: point social relat take autonom form money simpli mean end rather increas becom main end one ask begin fact social relat mean
TEXT:  Some sort of medial form must always be used, in order for there to be social relations—even if it is only the language spoken: The latter, however, is also, of course, autonomous vis-à-vis individuals, inasmuch as no one can choose language (and all its structures, metaphorical implications, etc., LINE: 1367, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: sort medial form must alway use order social relat even languag spoken latter howev also cours autonom individu inasmuch one choos languag structur metaphor implic
TEXT: ). One is born into a language (or more than one language). Language always already has an “autonomous objective shape”: for example, in the form of dictionaries and textbooks, schools (N.B.: the state!) and exams, with which little people have the “right” way to speak (and write) hammered into them., LINE: 1368, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: one born languag one languag languag alway alreadi ha autonom object shape exampl form dictionari textbook school state exam littl peopl right way speak write
TEXT:  These formulations are rather close to the core positions of media theory, and they make clear that media are never (or, at any rate, not only) tools of subjects that exist before them—language makes this even clearer than money., LINE: 1369, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: formul rather close core posit medium theori make clear medium never rate tool subject exist languag make even clearer money
TEXT:  To this extent, Marx’s thesis that money is not only a “cleverly devised expedient,”11 but rather, as Ernst puts it, an “autonomous social power” is very close to the positions of media theory12 (as, in any case, much in Marx reads like media theory avant la lettre)., LINE: 1370, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: extent thesi money cleverli expedi rather put autonom social power close posit medium theori case much read like medium theori
TEXT:  But Marx—as Ernst indicates—rejected precisely the comparison between language and money (cf. Marx 1973: 162–163). Above all, he emphasizes the following difference. Whereas an abstract concept like “the animal” only exists in thought and speech—and does not really exist alongside particular animals—precisely this is supposed to be the case for the “real abstraction,” money: “the animal” is supposed, so to say, really to exist alongside the concrete animals., LINE: 1371, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: precis comparison languag money follow differ wherea abstract concept like anim thought speech doe realli exist alongsid particular anim precis suppos case real abstract money anim suppos say realli exist alongsid concret anim
TEXT:  And this would be a fundamental difference. But it is not. It is an entirely ordinary observation that orders of signs exist parallel to orders of things and mutually relate to one another. I can say: “Please bring me that apple!”—and then (ideally) the apple is brought to me., LINE: 1372, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: would fundament differ entir ordinari observ order sign exist parallel order thing mutual relat one anoth say pleas bring appl ideal appl brought
TEXT:  Thus, although I only used an arbitrary sign for the apple, the real apple is changed (here its position, etc.). Under specific institutional conditions—which, however, are generally relevant for exchange-value too (see above)—the utterance of the sentence “I hereby pronounce you husband and wife!” brings about a change in personal status, with all the associated consequences., LINE: 1373, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: thu although use arbitrari sign appl real appl posit specif institut condit howev gener relev exchang valu see utter sentenc herebi pronounc husband wife chang person statu associ consequ
TEXT:  Language is not only descriptive and/or abstractive, but also performative. It is not always only “mere symbol,” which passively represents something real, but it can also intervene as symbol and change the real., LINE: 1374, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: languag descript abstract also perform alway mere symbol passiv someth real also interven symbol chang real
TEXT:  Money as “independent value of commodities” means: A state-controlled (and for this reason alone, trustworthy) set of symbols represents value in the form of numbers that are comparable to other such numbers—attached to or associated with objects of use, which are then commodities., LINE: 1375, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: money independ valu commod mean state reason alon trustworthi set symbol valu form number compar number attach associ object use commod
TEXT:  “Real abstraction” means, then, that one can also represent these numbers on diverse media: for example, bills or computer displays. And thus they exist “alongside” the things—which, however, they already exist “beside” or, in other words, independently of them, since I can remove the price tag from the apple, whereby nothing remains in the apple that alludes to its exchange-value., LINE: 1376, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: real abstract mean one also repres number divers medium exampl bill comput display thu exist alongsid thing howev alreadi exist besid word independ sinc remov price tag appl wherebi noth remain appl exchang valu

TEXT:  It is the act of exchange—i.e. of comparing the symbols on price tags and bills, of “comparison with money” (Marx 1973: 190)—that first creates value as equivalent.

TEXT:  As long as these processes occur on a daily basis, exchange-value continues to exist.

TEXT:  It exists in a performative manner. This can undoubtedly be criticized as a “circulation-ideological” reduction of value—but nobody is saying that such processes only occur in exchange on markets. A firm that produces commodities also has somehow to “attach” a price to objects: for example, the price at which it transfers them to retailers; and those that receive the commodities provide monetary symbols, etc., LINE: 1383, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: perform manner undoubtedli circul ideolog reduct valu nobodi say process occur exchang market firm produc commod also ha somehow attach price object exampl price transfer retail receiv commod provid monetari symbol

TEXT:  (1) I think it is important to recall what explanatory function value theory is supposed to perform. By way of his thesis of a necessary connection between commodities and money, Marx attempts to capture a basic motor activity of capitalist synthesis, with the aim of being able to “derive” conclusions about the development of modern capitalism that are as definitive as possible., LINE: 1395, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: think import recal explanatori function valu theori suppos perform way thesi necessari connect commod money attempt captur basic motor activ capitalist synthesi aim abl deriv conclus develop modern capit definit possibl
TEXT:  This applies not only for the (monetary) labor theory of value, but also for the theoretical format of “value theory” as such: hence, also for “subjective” value theories. The aim is always to relate empirical phenomena (economic dynamics) back to a fundamental principle., LINE: 1396, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: monetari labor theori valu also theoret format valu theori henc also subject valu theori aim alway relat empir phenomenon econom dynam back fundament principl
TEXT:  This, of course, allows informative (and hence attractive) theories to be constructed. But this is also perhaps a problem. A few years ago, Frank Beckenbach (2014) posed the question of whether the labor theory of value in Marx (even if it is a monetary labor theory of value) does not occupy a similar position in Marx’s theoretical architecture as the auctioneer concept in general equilibrium theory., LINE: 1397, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: cours inform henc attract theori also perhap problem year ago frank question whether labor theori valu even monetari labor theori valu doe occupi similar posit theoret architectur auction concept gener equilibrium theori
TEXT: 13 Since the all-round interdependence of all market and production processes is analytically intractable, Walras used a theoretical figure that transformed the chaotic dynamic of market processes into the much clearer (= analytically and mathematically more manageable) form of a central auction market., LINE: 1398, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: sinc round interdepend market product process analyt intract use theoret figur chaotic dynam market process much clearer analyt mathemat manag form central auction market
TEXT:  There are short-cuts of this sort in Marx too: from the (monetary) labor theory of value as foundation to various synthetic concepts that are to be found over the course of the three volumes of Capital (for instance, for the assumptions of an intra-industry and cross-industry equalization of profit rates)., LINE: 1399, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: short cut sort monetari labor theori valu foundat variou synthet concept found cours three volum capit instanc assumpt industri cross industri equal profit rate
TEXT:  These too are synthetic figures—short-cuts, in a way—which display strong order theoretical or equilibrium theoretical elements.

TEXT:  In particular, in evolutionary economics and complexity economics, efforts are being made nowadays to depict and theoretically conceptualize such aggregation problems without referring to a presupposed theory of value (of whatever sort)., LINE: 1401, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: particular evolutionari econom complex econom effort made nowaday depict theoret conceptu aggreg problem without theori valu whatev sort
TEXT:  One is, then, dealing with a whole series of types of states: equilibrium, multiple equilibria, chaos, etc. From a given initial constellation of a (complex, adaptive) system, one can, then, only to a very limited extent derive conclusions about its development, since there are various possible trajectories., LINE: 1402, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: one deal whole seri type state equilibrium multipl equilibrium chao given initi constel complex adapt system one limit extent deriv conclus develop sinc variou possibl trajectori
TEXT:  And since the economy is a non-linear system, even small changes (at whatever point) can lead to large effects. If one discusses the matter against this background, the question arises of how far the derivation of money from the dual character of the commodity gets us in capturing the developmental tendencies of the capitalist economy., LINE: 1403, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: sinc economi non linear system even small chang whatev point lead larg effect one matter background question far deriv money dual charact commod get development tendenc capitalist economi
TEXT:  As an analytical point of departure, I think that the Marxian conception is unrivaled. For me, the resulting mode of research is another question. This also concerns the question of something like an “ideal average,” if we assume that the core categorial structure is also not something entirely fixed, but rather new forms of autonomization of value emerge in the historical dynamics (for instance, the second-order commodities that Ernst has thematized in recent publications)., LINE: 1404, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: analyt point departur think concept unriv result mode research anoth question also concern question someth like ideal averag assum core categori structur also someth entir fix rather new form valu emerg histor dynam instanc second order commod ha recent public
TEXT:  Another point is connected to this. In a book that became known, above all, for having shown in a highly convincing manner that the constitution of marginalism and general equilibrium theory is owed to extensive conceptual borrowing from physics, Mirowski (1999) also takes a glance at the Marxian critique of political economy., LINE: 1405, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: anoth point connect book known shown highli convinc manner constitut gener equilibrium theori extens conceptu borrow physic also take glanc critiqu polit economi
TEXT:  He there conjectures: It would have been too much to expect Marx to have foreseen that the very ontology of the physical world was also experiencing metamorphosis in his lifetime, and yet, it can be argued that the scientific community’s transition from substance to field had some influence on his understanding of the labor theory of value, in that there ended up being not one but two Marxian labor theories of value: the first rooted in the older substance tradition, the other sporting resemblances to nascent field theories in physics., LINE: 1406, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: conjectur would much expect ontolog physic world wa also metamorphosi lifetim yet scientif commun transit substanc field influenc understand labor theori valu end one two labor theori valu first root older substanc tradit sport resembl nascent field theori physic
TEXT:  Mirowski 1999: 177 It follows that one would have further to discuss the question of the coherence of the Marxian position. The critique of political economy is, after all, a work that remained unfinished—also and precisely with regard to the goal of analytically exposing the basic categorial structure of the capitalist economy., LINE: 1407, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: one would discu question coher posit critiqu polit economi work unfinish also precis regard goal analyt basic categori structur capitalist economi
TEXT:  (2) When we do social analysis on the basis of a form-critical understanding of the critique of political economy, then the question always arises of the scope of monetary theory and the analysis of capitalism., LINE: 1408, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: social analysi basi form critic understand critiqu polit economi question alway scope monetari theori analysi capit
TEXT:  Originally, Marx had in mind the elaboration of a general theory of socio-cultural development (the “materialist conception of history”), in order then, on this basis, to elaborate a specific theory of the capitalist economy as the presumed center of modern society., LINE: 1409, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: origin mind elabor gener theori cultur develop materialist concept histori order basi elabor specif theori capitalist economi center modern societi
TEXT:  As is well known, the former undertaking remained stuck in the state of a program; the latter undertaking grew constantly in terms of its scope, the more Marx pursued the ramifications and the internal complexity of the capitalist system on the categorial level., LINE: 1410, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: well known former undertak stuck state program latter undertak grew constantli term scope ramif intern complex capitalist system categori level
TEXT:  As a result, the theory of socio-cultural development was not taken up again. Beginning with the late Engels and then, above all, in the Soviet sphere of influence, a sort of proletarian worldview was cobbled together out of bits and pieces taken, above all, from The German Ideology., LINE: 1411, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: result theori cultur develop wa taken begin late soviet sphere influenc sort proletarian wa togeth bit piec taken german ideolog
TEXT:  This was meant to serve as a legitimating ideology and as a competing program to bourgeois narratives of progress. This is, of course, unacceptable. I do think, however, that we need a “higher level” or general theory of socio-cultural development: not because history necessarily has to interest us as an end-in-itself, but for analyzing the dynamics of contemporary capitalism., LINE: 1412, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: wa meant serv ideolog program bourgeoi narr progress cours unaccept think howev need higher level gener theori cultur develop histori necessarili ha interest end dynam contemporari capit
TEXT:  In Manfred Faßler (2014), we find an attempt to reconstruct, historically and genetically, “the social” as a specific mode of organization. The focus here is on the development of non-genetic group artifacts (tools, settlements, infrastructure, administrations) (Faßler 2014: 16), whose historical emergence transformed traditional forms of sociality, which can essentially be described as kinship selection., LINE: 1413, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: find attempt reconstruct histor genet social specif mode organ focu develop non genet group artifact tool settlement infrastructur administr whose histor emerg tradit form social essenti kinship select
TEXT:  Faßler speaks of a second-order sociality that is set in motion with abstract figures, signs, calculations, symbols, and representation and is reproduced by way of the inheritance of systems of abstraction, plans, writings, sketches, instructions, and that is more and more strongly influencing the modes of socio-cultural development (Faßler 2014: 79)., LINE: 1414, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: second order social set motion abstract figur sign calcul symbol represent way inherit system abstract plan write sketch instruct strongli mode cultur develop
TEXT:  I think that it is useful to discuss money in this context: hence comparatively—both in diachronic and synchronic terms—with other media of this second-order sociality. Such matters have been considered, above all, following Sohn-Rethel (1971), though in an insufficiently complex fashion., LINE: 1415, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: think use discu money context henc compar diachron synchron term medium second order social matter consid follow though insuffici complex fashion
TEXT:  Jens has already noted that money has been hardly addressed in media-theoretical research: at least in the line of research that descends from Kittler. This is perhaps due to Kittler’s (political or theoretical-political) stance of taking the greatest possible distance from Marx and from the Frankfurt School., LINE: 1416, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: ha alreadi note money ha hardli medium theoret research least line research perhap due polit theoret polit stanc take possibl distanc school
TEXT:  Nonetheless, as a “network of technologies and institutions that allow a given culture to select, store, and process relevant data” (Kittler 1990: 369), his central concept of a “discourse network” (a system of notation) has a certain proximity to form-critical ways of interpreting the critique of political economy., LINE: 1417, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: nonetheless network technolog institut allow given cultur select store process relev data central concept discours network system notat ha certain proxim form critic way critiqu polit economi
TEXT:  For what Kittler identifies as the blind spots of the humanities and of (Marxist) sociology—viz. the focus of the one on “meaning” and of the other on “labor,” whereby the (medial) conditions of possibility of meaning and labor are hidden from view—has a clear proximity to the Marxian critique of political economy (or, today, of mainstream economics): Marx’s criticism, intended for Smith and Ricardo, that, “entirely under the influence of material interests,” they overlooked the form-aspects of economic categories in a way that is analogous to how “before Hegel, professional logicians … overlooked the formal content of the types of judgments and syllogisms” (Marx [1867] 1983: 32) has at least an entirely analogous structure., LINE: 1418, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: blind spot human sociolog focu one mean labor wherebi medial condit possibl mean labor hidden view ha clear proxim critiqu polit economi today econom critic intend smith entir influenc materi interest form aspect econom categori way analog profession logician formal content type judgment syllog ha least entir analog structur
TEXT:  Another example would be Luhmann’s (1981) theory of social evolution, which claims that there is a connection between the dominant media of communication and the primary forms of differentiation of corresponding social formations., LINE: 1419, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: anoth exampl would theori social evolut claim connect domin medium commun primari form differenti correspond social format
TEXT: 14 Speech (orality) correlates with the segmented differentiation regime of archaic societies; the spread of written culture, with the stratified differentiation of earlier advanced civilizations up to feudalism; and book printing, finally, leads in the long-run to the modern—functionally differentiated—society., LINE: 1420, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: speech oral correl segment differenti regim archaic societi spread written cultur stratifi differenti advanc civil feudal book print final lead long run modern function societi
TEXT:  This may be too schematically constructed, and, of course, matters prove to be more complex, when one brings in concrete historical studies. But it draws our attention to the fact that the development of the capitalist economy does not occur in a vacuum, but rather is surrounded by other processes that interact with the genesis and development of capitalism without everything of relevance being reducible to the economy., LINE: 1421, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: may schemat cours matter prove complex one concret histor studi draw attent fact develop capitalist economi doe occur vacuum rather surround process interact genesi develop capit without everyth relev reduc economi
TEXT:  Ernst Lohoff 1. What We Are Arguing About In my initial contribution, I sketched out the Marxian concept of money as general commodity (that has been set apart from other commodities) on the background of a fetishism-critical interpretation of the critique of political economy; and, in this context, I posed the question of what relation this concept has to attempts to draw on media-theoretical approaches to solve the riddle of money., LINE: 1422, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: initi contribut concept money gener commod ha set apart commod background fetish critic interpret critiqu polit economi context question relat concept ha attempt draw medium theoret approach solv riddl money
TEXT:  Jens seems to have interpreted my reflections as if they led to declaring the two approaches to be incompatible. I feel that I have been a bit misunderstood. For me, the question is not so much “whether money is to be understood as ‘commodity that has been set apart from other commodities’ or as ‘medium’” (Jens), but rather how we can concretely conceive of these two definitions., LINE: 1423, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: reflect led two approach incompat feel bit misunderstood question much whether money understood commod ha set apart commod medium rather concret conceiv two definit
TEXT:  To this extent, my intentions are not so different from those of Jens. It is only that I fear that in the case of their combination, the specific content of the Marxian concept of money could get plowed under., LINE: 1424, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: extent intent differ fear case combin specif content concept money could get
TEXT:  It is entirely clear to me that I am here advocating a minority position in the discussion of Marxian theory. This is precisely the background to my fears.

TEXT:  to make the Marxian critique of political economy useful for the analysis of the current ludicrous monetary system and its glaring contradictions.

TEXT:  As Roman Rosdolsky (1977) has described in his The Making of Marx’s Capital, Marx himself repeatedly uses this concept himself in the Grundrisse. In his later writings, it is discarded and its use is vehemently attacked., LINE: 1428, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: ha make capit repeatedli us concept later write use vehement
TEXT:  So, did Marx’s theoretical position on money fundamentally change after the drafting of the Grundrisse? In fact, it did not. Rather, acceptance and rejection of the symbol concept concern different theoretical levels., LINE: 1429, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: theoret posit money fundament chang draft fact rather accept reject symbol concept concern differ theoret level
TEXT:  When money appears as social symbol in the Grundrisse, this is because for Marx as critic of fetishism all commodities, without exception, represent social symbols or social ciphers—and hence, of course, so too does the general commodity., LINE: 1430, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: money social symbol critic fetish commod without except repres social symbol social cipher henc cours doe gener commod
TEXT:  On the basis of the Marxian critique of fetishism, being a social symbol and having value objectivity is not a contradiction, but rather one and the same thing. But Marx was completely alone in this. Already at the time, in all other theoretical contexts, ascribing a symbolic character to money meant declaring it to be in essence a non-commodity and denying its value objectivity., LINE: 1431, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: basi critiqu fetish social symbol valu object contradict rather one thing wa complet alon alreadi time theoret context symbol charact money meant essenc non commod valu object
TEXT:  Marx took his distance from this view, when he rejected the conception of money as mere symbol. In our time, however, the position that Marx combated is more than ever the consensus. In light of the foregoing, it is absolutely indispensable consistently to hold the front against the idea that money, in contrast to commodities, has a symbolic character., LINE: 1432, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: took distanc view concept money mere symbol time howev posit ever consensu light forego absolut indispens consist hold front idea money contrast commod ha symbol charact
TEXT:  A very similar problem is posed by the media concept. That money is a social mediator is obvious. It would be absurd to deny its status as medium. The problem is rather that when it is a matter of analyzing the capitalist mode of production, the media concept is almost automatically reserved for money., LINE: 1433, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: similar problem medium concept money social mediat obviou would absurd deni statu medium problem rather matter capitalist mode product medium concept almost automat reserv money
TEXT:  But if we take the Marxian analysis of fetishism seriously, money is a derivative intermediary: It is the obvious superficial appearance of more profound formal relationships of mediation in capitalism., LINE: 1434, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: take analysi fetish serious money deriv intermediari obviou superfici appear profound formal relationship mediat capit
TEXT:  It is the “externalized expression of the form of social mediation that constitutes capitalist society” (Postone 1993: 265). It follows that social mediation does not first take place in circulation. The existence of money “expresses” rather “the fact that labor functions as a socially mediating activity” (Postone 1993: 265)., LINE: 1435, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: express form social mediat capitalist societi social mediat doe first take place circul exist money express rather fact labor function social mediat activ
TEXT:  Inasmuch as the dominant way of thinking fixates on money as social mediator, it always presupposes as self-evident the relation of mediation on which this is based: viz. the dissolution of society into separate private producers., LINE: 1436, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: inasmuch domin way think money social mediat alway self evid relat mediat base dissolut societi separ privat produc
TEXT:  It was Marx’s greatest analytical accomplishment in his critique of political economy to shine a light on this basic relationship of mediation, which is effaced in the dominant consciousness, and to expose it as the specifically capitalist form of social mediation., LINE: 1437, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: wa analyt accomplish critiqu polit economi shine light basic relationship mediat domin conscious expos specif capitalist form social mediat
TEXT:  3. The Circulative Reduction Precisely the decisive insight (also for monetary theory) that the transformation of the production of wealth into private labor raises the latter to the status of basic medium of social mediation is almost completely obscured in the reception of Marx’s work., LINE: 1438, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: circul reduct precis decis insight also monetari theori transform product wealth privat labor rais latter statu basic medium social mediat almost complet recept work
TEXT:  At least in the German academic discussion, the tone is currently being set by positions that not only leave the inner connection between value constitution and private labor in the dark, but positively spirit it away., LINE: 1439, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: least german academ discuss tone current set posit leav inner connect valu constitut privat labor dark posit spirit away
TEXT:  In the nineteenth century, a naturalistic understanding of the substance of value was widespread, and elements of such a view also gained entry into the presentation in Capital. The representatives of the “new reading of Marx,” in particular, take this as an occasion to throw out the baby with the bathwater., LINE: 1440, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: nineteenth centuri naturalist understand substanc valu wa widespread element view also entri present capit repres new read particular take occas throw babi
TEXT:  Instead of clearing away this detritus and consistently reconstructing the inner connection between private labor and value substance on the basis of an orientation to the problem of fetishism, the constitution of value is de facto shifted to the sphere of circulation., LINE: 1441, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: instead clear away detritu consist inner connect privat labor valu substanc basi orient problem fetish constitut valu sphere circul
TEXT:  The bridge that Jens wants to build between media theory and the Marxian critique of political economy has a structural defect, to the extent that, at least in several passages, it takes over the hegemonic interpretation and its circulative reduction., LINE: 1442, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: bridg want build medium theori critiqu polit economi ha structur defect extent least sever passag take hegemon interpret circul reduct
TEXT:  These include, above all, the following: The things are not “shells” for human labor and, therefore, value; they contain no value. Value is thus strictly external: It is the act of exchange—i.e. of comparing the symbols on price labels and bills, of “comparison with money” (Marx 1973: 190)—which first creates value as equivalent., LINE: 1443, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: includ follow thing shell human labor therefor valu contain valu valu thu strictli extern act exchang symbol price label bill comparison money first valu equival
TEXT:  This act takes place according to strict rules, which are enforced by the police. By equating value constitution and the act of exchange, value and price necessarily merge into one another. The distinction between them becomes artificial., LINE: 1444, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: act take place accord strict rule enforc polic valu constitut act exchang valu price necessarili merg one anoth distinct becom artifici
TEXT:  This already points to the fact that the depth dimension of the Marxian analysis vanishes in such an exchange-centered argumentation. But another aspect is more important for our topic. As I already emphasized in my first statement, Marx grasps money as the externalization of the inner contradiction of the commodity, inasmuch as it, on the one hand, represents abstract exchange-value and, on the other, has a particular use-value., LINE: 1445, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: alreadi point fact depth dimens analysi exchang center argument anoth aspect import topic alreadi first statement grasp money extern inner contradict commod inasmuch one hand abstract exchang valu ha particular use valu
TEXT:  The logical point of departure for the constitution of money is “this division of the product of labor into a useful thing and a thing possessing value” (Marx 1976: 166). Whether or not this is the intention, having the constitution of value first begin with exchange means cutting off this dimension of the Marxian concept of money., LINE: 1446, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: logic point departur constitut money divis product labor use thing thing possess valu whether intent constitut valu first begin exchang mean cut dimens concept money
TEXT:  At the same time, if one declares the act of exchange to be the constitutive act of commodity and value, the connection between commodity and value, on the one hand, and money, on the other, gets inverted with respect to the Marxian view., LINE: 1447, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: time one act exchang constitut act commod valu connect commod valu one hand money get invert respect view
TEXT:  Money no longer derives from the dual character of the commodity, as in Marx, but rather it is only meeting up with money in the act of exchange that first converts simple things into commodities. Michael Heinrich, currently the most popular representative of the “new reading” of Marx, explicitly defends the idea that the products of private labor first take on the character of commodities in exchange., LINE: 1448, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: money longer dual charact commod rather meet money act exchang first convert simpl thing commod current popular repres new read explicitli idea product privat labor first take charact commod exchang
TEXT:  What Marx considered the basic characteristic of capitalist society and what forms the actual starting point for his analysis, viz. the transformation of the production of wealth into private labor, is thereby effaced., LINE: 1449, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: consid basic characterist capitalist societi form actual start point analysi transform product wealth privat labor therebi
TEXT:  And one has to read Jen’s text really generously, in order still to detect the relation to private labor as instance of social mediation in his definition of the commodity: “Being a commodity means being connected to a symbol for a certain exchange-value., LINE: 1450, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: one ha read text realli gener order still detect relat privat labor instanc social mediat definit commod commod mean connect symbol certain exchang valu
TEXT:  A commodity is an object with a use-value that has been made into a medium of exchange-value (or was already produced as such).” At any rate, as compared to Marx, the connection has become extremely loose., LINE: 1451, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: commod object use valu ha made medium exchang valu wa alreadi produc rate connect ha becom extrem loos
TEXT:  Marx, namely, used the following apodictic formulation: “Only the products of mutually independent acts of private labor, performed in isolation, confront each other as commodities” (Marx 1976: 132; translation modified)., LINE: 1452, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: name use follow apodict formul product mutual independ act privat labor isol confront commod translat
TEXT:  He thus derived the character of the product as commodity directly from the transformation of the production of wealth into private labor. 4. Thought Abstraction and Real Abstraction This logical status of money as the necessarily objectified form of appearance of basic social mediation via private labor and the products of private labor does not negate its own medial character, but it does make money a medium sui generis., LINE: 1453, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: thu deriv charact product commod directli transform product wealth privat labor thought abstract real abstract logic statu money necessarili form appear basic social mediat via privat labor product privat labor doe negat medial charact doe make money medium
TEXT:  Above all, money exhibits a peculiarity to which, as far as I know, there is no parallel among other media. For the money commodity as derivative medium to confront the cosmos of many particular commodities as “the absolute existence of exchange-value” (Marx [1857–1858] 1953: 919) and general commodity, it must itself represent capitalist wealth., LINE: 1454, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: money exhibit peculiar far know parallel among medium money commod deriv medium confront cosmo mani particular commod absolut exist exchang valu gener commod must repres capitalist wealth
TEXT:  It must either, like gold, stand for past dead labor or, like today’s artificial money commodity, the titles to ownership of the central banks, as well as the titles to ownership that are negotiated between private actors on the money and capital markets, represent future value production., LINE: 1455, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: must either like gold stand past dead labor like today artifici money commod titl ownership central bank well titl ownership privat actor money capit market repres futur valu product
TEXT:  The general commodity thus has the same content as that which it mediates. Marx essentially sets out from this substantive equivalence, when he grasps money as real abstraction, and, in order to elucidate the comparison with the animal kingdom that I have cited, notes: “It is as if next to and apart from lions, tigers, hares and all other really existing animals …, there existed also the animal, the individual incarnation of the whole animal kingdom., LINE: 1456, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: gener commod thu ha content essenti set substant equival grasp money real abstract order elucid comparison anim kingdom note next apart lion tiger hare realli anim also anim individu incarn whole anim kingdom
TEXT:  Such an individual, which in itself comprises all really existent sorts of the same thing, is a universal: like animal, God, etc.” (Marx [1867] 1983: 37). Jens does not consider the inner connection between private labor and the commodity character of human products., LINE: 1457, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: individu realli exist sort thing univers like anim god doe consid inner connect privat labor commod charact human product
TEXT:  Thus the equivalence between commodity and money appears as a process of abstraction that is, as it were, externally imposed on products of labor in exchange. The substantive identity between the money commodity, as the general representative of the system of private labor, and particular commodities, which each represent a particular form of private labor, is thus made invisible., LINE: 1458, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: thu equival commod money process abstract extern product labor exchang substant ident money commod gener repres system privat labor particular commod repres particular form privat labor thu made invis
TEXT:  This is why Jens rejects the view that there is a fundamental difference between the money medium and other media, such as language, for instance. Jen first summarizes the Marxian argument: Whereas an abstract concept like “the animal” only exists in thought and speech—and does not really exist alongside particular animals—precisely this is supposed to be the case for the “real abstraction,” money: “the animal” is supposed, so to say, really to exist alongside the concrete animals., LINE: 1459, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: reject view fundament differ money medium medium languag instanc first argument wherea abstract concept like anim thought speech doe realli exist alongsid particular anim precis suppos case real abstract money anim suppos say realli exist alongsid concret anim
TEXT:  And this would be a fundamental difference. But it is not. It is an entirely ordinary observation that orders of signs exist parallel to orders of things and mutually relate to one another. I can say: “Please bring me that apple!”—and then (ideally) the apple is brought to me., LINE: 1460, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: would fundament differ entir ordinari observ order sign exist parallel order thing mutual relat one anoth say pleas bring appl ideal appl brought
TEXT:  Thus, although I only used an arbitrary sign for the apple, the real apple is changed (here its position, etc.). A few lines further on, Jens draws his conclusion: “Language is not only descriptive and/or abstractive, but also performative., LINE: 1461, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: thu although use arbitrari sign appl real appl posit line draw conclus languag descript abstract also perform

TEXT:  Language undoubtedly has a performative character and, like all media, it affects that which it mediates. But Marx’s core argument is not at all that language only passively reflects reality.

TEXT:  This is because we are each operating with different concepts of the categories of commodity and value. This is not only evident in the case of particular commodities.

TEXT:  I insist on the fact that every monetary system is based on a money commodity, which provides backing for the legal means of payment.

TEXT:  The possessions of the central banks constitute the foundation of the monetary system. Precious metals stored in the vaults of the central banks occupied this key position in the era of gold-backing. Today, commodities of an entirely different sort have replaced monetary gold as the general commodity: namely, the tradable monetary claims that are amassed in the central banks when credit is extended to commercial banks., LINE: 1470, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: possess central bank constitut foundat monetari system preciou metal vault central bank key posit era gold back today commod entir differ sort monetari gold gener commod name tradabl monetari claim central bank credit extend commerci bank

TEXT:  It is also compatible with the common practice in economics of defining money by way of its functions.

TEXT:  The monetary system is differentiated. From this point of view, the hundred euro bill is not a commodity at all, but rather, as a worthless piece of paper, it merely refers to the general commodity.

TEXT:  Banknotes of a central bank that, as “equivalent” for the issued central bank money, only had claims in the books that need to be written off would not be worth the paper on which they are printed.

TEXT:  Despite his wanting to think about the character of money as general commodity with a symbolic character, it is hard to distinguish his train of thought from this common interpretative model.

TEXT:  This is why being the bearer of a symbol does not mean being a ‘mere symbol,’ since the price is a symbol that is stabilized with extreme violence.” It is undoubtedly correct that the state imposes the bourgeois property order with its legal code and its monopoly of violence; but this is something other than securing the social validity of money and “monetary stability” (i., LINE: 1481, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: bearer symbol doe mean mere symbol sinc price symbol extrem violenc undoubtedli correct state bourgeoi properti order legal code monopoli violenc someth social valid money monetari stabil
TEXT: e. the stability of money’s value). As concerns the former, laws and the billy club are certainly proven means; but they quickly run up against their limits in the case of the latter. In the early modern period, when gold and silver coins still served as means of circulation, the persistently hard-up states were happy to use their right of coinage to create income by reducing the real metal content of their coins below the nominal content., LINE: 1482, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: stabil money valu concern former law billi club certainli proven mean quickli run limit case latter earli modern period gold silver coin still mean circul persist hard state happi use right coinag creat incom reduc real metal content coin nomin content
TEXT:  But the outcome of this debasement of the coinage was always that the exchange-value of the coins fell to the real metal content. When, in the First World War, the warring parties financed their military expenditures by printing money, the result was a similar phenomenon—one need only think of the hyperinflation in vanquished Germany that reached its highpoint and culmination in 1923., LINE: 1483, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: outcom debas coinag wa alway exchang valu coin fell real metal content first world war parti militari expenditur print money result wa similar phenomenon one need think culmin

TEXT:  I see no other way to describe this that does not essentialize value in substance-metaphysical fashion and, hence, does indeed make it into an “atom.”15 Needless to say, goods are produced (in capitalism) as commodities for circulation; but they can also only be realized as commodities in circulation., LINE: 1492, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: see way describ doe essenti valu substanc metaphys fashion henc doe inde make atom needless say good produc capit commod circul also commod circul

TEXT:  On the one hand—which Ernst, unfortunately, does not thematize—Marx says that “not an atom of matter enters into the objectivity of commodities as values” (Marx 1976: 138) and, on the other (if, in part, critically), that commodities themselves can be understood as symbols—which Ernst also affirms: “Being a social symbol and having value objectivity is not a contradiction, but rather one and the same thing., LINE: 1494, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: one hand unfortun doe say atom matter object commod valu part critic commod understood symbol also social symbol valu object contradict rather one thing

TEXT: ” Money and commodities are both symbolic, and the question which is more “genuine” simply makes no sense. My actual knowledge interest is, so to say, materialist.

TEXT:  Where and how is the value? How is it operatively created and performatively stabilized? Constantly to say that capitalism is “real metaphysics” and value is not empirical sounds like an idealist metaphysics—and this is one of the main reasons that is difficult to make connections to value criticism: for instance, in media theory., LINE: 1497, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: valu oper constantli say capit real metaphys valu empir sound like idealist metaphys one main reason difficult make connect valu critic instanc medium theori

TEXT:  To start with: I agree with Ernst’s idea of flagging money as a “medium sui generis”: a sort of particular and distinguished medium. But here too, a precise materialist investigation would have to be undertaken to establish how this centrality is historically produced, medially stabilized and extended (e., LINE: 1506, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: start agre idea flag money medium sort particular distinguish medium precis materialist investig would establish central histor produc medial extend

TEXT:  Ernst argues, however, that the peculiar character of money lies in the fact that money is a different type of medium and has a different type of ontology (which raises the questions of whether it is, then, a medium at all): “Even if my use of the word ‘apple’ can bring a real apple into my possession, the word as such never becomes a real apple., LINE: 1508, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: howev peculiar charact money lie fact money differ type medium ha differ type ontolog rais question whether medium even use word appl bring real appl possess word never becom real appl

TEXT: ” This applies also to the “actual money” or the “actual money commodity” discovered by Ernst. He writes: “It must either, like gold, stand for past dead labor or, like today’s artificial money commodity, the titles to ownership of the central banks, as well as the titles to ownership that are negotiated between private actors on the money and capital markets, represent future value production., LINE: 1512, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: also actual money actual money commod discov must either like gold stand past dead labor like today artifici money commod titl ownership central bank well titl ownership privat actor money capit market repres futur valu product

TEXT:  It “stands for something” or “represents something”—even at times, as Ernst rightly underscores, for something that is completely fictitious: “future value production.” And fictitiousness is something genuinely medial: There are no fictive entities like “future value production” outside of symbolic processes., LINE: 1515, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: stand someth someth even time rightli underscor someth complet fictiti futur valu product fictiti someth genuin medial fictiv entiti like futur valu product outsid symbol process
TEXT:  The “actual money commodity” is also to be found in “books.” To this extent, there is no difference between “actual” money and its “mere symbol.” Both are symbols. In my opinion, this has nothing to do with the criticism, to which I already responded above, concerning whether one “locates the constitution of commodities and value in the act of exchange., LINE: 1516, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: actual money commod also found book extent differ actual money mere symbol symbol opinion ha noth critic alreadi concern whether one constitut commod valu act exchang
TEXT: ” In another text, Ernst (Lohoff 2013: 49) describes “the general commodity, to which issued paper money owes its backing and from which its role as money(-proxy) is derived.” The general commodity “backs the token money issued by the central bank” (Lohoff 2013: 50)., LINE: 1517, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: anoth text gener commod paper money back role money proxi deriv gener commod back token money central bank
TEXT:  The most important function of the money commodity thus appears to consist in providing backing. In the past, gold and, now, the future constitute the ultimate reference of the monetary system. And what reference symbols have, how their meaning gets stabilized, is a genuine semiotic and media-theoretical question., LINE: 1518, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: import function money commod thu consist provid back past gold futur constitut ultim refer monetari system refer symbol mean get genuin semiot medium theoret question
TEXT:  Formulated in this way, we can again ask: How is the reference of “value” stabilized or destabilized? What role is played here by the state, etc. .? How does this reference fall into crisis? If commodity, value and the independent expression of the latter in money are understood as symbolic processes, then we can also ask about the possibility of alternative systems of signs., LINE: 1519, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: way ask refer valu role state doe refer fall crisi commod valu independ express latter money understood symbol process also ask possibl altern system sign
TEXT:  Ernst Lohoff In his contribution, Hanno cites Philip Mirowski (1999: 177) and his suggestion that there are “not one but two Marxian labor theories of value,” and he adds: “It follows that one would have again to discuss the question of the coherence of the Marxian position., LINE: 1520, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: contribut cite suggest one two labor theori valu add one would discu question coher posit

TEXT:  This is all the more the case, inasmuch as a deeper fissure runs through the Marxian value concept than that which Mirowski took as the occasion to speak of “two Marxian theories of value.” Even if the value concept of classical political economy and the physiological concept of labor, which emerged decades later and borrowed from the physical conception of “energy expenditure,” are not identical, they are related as variants of a trans-historical and positive concept of labor value., LINE: 1522, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: case inasmuch fissur run valu concept took occas speak two theori valu even valu concept classic polit economi physiolog concept labor decad later physic concept energi expenditur ident relat variant histor posit concept labor valu

TEXT:  To the extent that Marx reverts to the standpoint of a positive labor theory of value, his position fits into the theoretical debates of his time; on the other hand, his fetishism-analytical value concept, such as forms the basis, above all, for the presentation in Capital, represents an erratic block in the scientific landscape—and it does so up to today., LINE: 1524, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: extent standpoint posit labor theori valu posit fit theoret debat time hand fetish analyt valu concept form basi present capit errat block scientif landscap doe today

TEXT: ” The value-critical approach that I advocate does not even try to bridge over this contradiction, in order to salvage the unity of Marxian theory. Instead, it abides by the following paradigm. A Marxism that adheres to a positive, naturalizing labor theory of value, participates in the basic errors of classical political economy and its heir, mainstream economics, and is, in the last analysis, condemned to run into the same dead-ends as the latter., LINE: 1527, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: valu critic approach advoc doe even tri bridg contradict order salvag uniti theori instead follow paradigm posit labor theori valu basic error classic polit economi heir econom last analysi condemn run dead end latter
TEXT:  In the Marxian critique of fetishism, on the other hand, is to be found the key to the solution of the economic riddles that have brought about the failure of the dominant economic theory. Only on the basis of a concept of value that is consistently oriented to the critique of fetishism, and hence has been freed from the eggshells of a positive, naturalizing conception of labor value, is it possible further to develop the critique of political economy and to make it useful for the analysis of contemporary capitalism? Understood in this way, the theorem of the “two Marxes” has far-reaching implications for the question Hanno has raised concerning the theoretical status of the Marxian value concept., LINE: 1528, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: critiqu fetish hand found key solut econom riddl brought failur domin econom theori basi concept valu consist critiqu fetish henc ha freed eggshel posit concept labor valu possibl develop critiqu polit economi make use analysi contemporari capit understood way theorem two ha far reach implic question ha rais concern theoret statu valu concept

TEXT:  The theorist tries to apply thought abstractions that are as appropriate as possible to the complex reality, such as to provide order to the latter in his or her mind.

TEXT:  The intellectual accomplishment of the theorist consists in deciphering this real process of abstraction. As is well known, Marx did not claim to be opposing a new political economy to classical political economy, but rather to be formulating a critique of political economy., LINE: 1536, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: intellectu accomplish theorist real process abstract well known claim oppos new polit economi classic polit economi rather critiqu polit economi
TEXT:  This self-understanding points directly to the peculiar logical status of categories, such as that of value in the critique of fetishism. Marx by no means discards traditional value theories, in order to replace them with a new, positive value theory; rather, “value” as object of knowledge is simultaneously itself the object of criticism., LINE: 1537, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: self understand point directli peculiar logic statu categori valu critiqu fetish mean discard tradit valu theori order replac new posit valu theori rather valu object knowledg simultan object critic
TEXT:  For Marx, value is not a neutral-analytical concept, but rather itself, as real abstraction, a crazy reality, which can only be theoretically penetrated from a negating standpoint. The little word “critique” means here something more than taking an ethically motivated decision against the prevailing form of socialization; it refers to the inner contradictoriness and, in the final analysis, untenability of value as real category., LINE: 1538, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: valu neutral analyt concept rather real abstract crazi realiti theoret standpoint littl word critiqu mean someth take ethic decis form social inner final analysi unten valu real categori
TEXT:  This leads, however, to a second fundamental feature of the value concept, per the fetishism critique, that makes it stand out from the crowd of value theories: Value is also a category sui generis as a result of its thoroughly historical character., LINE: 1539, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: lead howev second fundament featur valu concept per fetish critiqu make stand crowd valu theori valu also categori result thoroughli histor charact
TEXT:  As a rule, the usual value theories have value emerging from the social division of labor per se and, consequently, treat it as a category that is suitable for every sort of economy based on the division of labor., LINE: 1540, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: rule usual valu theori valu social divis labor per consequ treat categori suitabl everi sort economi base divis labor
TEXT:  Marx, by contrast, emphasized that commodities only represent value as the form of presentation of separate acts of private labor. With its tendency to apotheosize labor, traditional Marxism has, as a rule, interpreted these remarks as if Marx’s point were to celebrate labor as the only source of social wealth and hence too of value., LINE: 1541, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: contrast commod repres valu form present separ act privat labor tendenc apotheos labor tradit ha rule remark point celebr labor sourc social wealth henc valu
TEXT:  In so doing, Marxism has reproduced the usual conception of value as a trans-historical category. But the Marx of the critique of fetishism is thus erased and the main point of his argumentation is stood on its head., LINE: 1542, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: ha usual concept valu histor categori critiqu fetish thu eras main point argument stood head
TEXT:  By deriving the constitution of value from private labor, Marx tied the formation of value to a specific social form of productive activity that first emerged along with capitalism. If the foundation of value, viz., LINE: 1543, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: constitut valu privat labor tie format valu specif social form product activ first along capit foundat valu
TEXT:  the dissolution of society into separate private producers, is to be grasped as a historically specific phenomenon, then it follows that this is also the case for the category of value itself. Value is thus, in the first place, something deeply historical, as the category is to be reserved for the capitalist mode of production., LINE: 1544, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: dissolut societi separ privat produc histor specif phenomenon also case categori valu valu thu first place someth deepli histor categori reserv capitalist mode product
TEXT:  Its historicity, however, also has a second dimension, which is at least as important for our questions, if not more so. Even on the basis of the capitalist mode of production, value has something like an internal history., LINE: 1545, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: histor howev also ha second dimens least import question even basi capitalist mode product valu ha someth like intern histori
TEXT:  Whereas the value concept has a static character in other value theories, the critique of political economy grasps value as a dynamic category, inasmuch as its relation to material wealth evolves in a very particular direction., LINE: 1546, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: wherea valu concept ha static charact valu theori critiqu polit economi grasp valu dynam categori inasmuch relat materi wealth particular direct
TEXT:  On the basis of the capitalist mode of production, whether and to what extent material production can be represented as value is subject to a particular historical trend of development. This concerns, in the first place, the level of individual commodities: As a result of the development of productivity, the labor-time necessary for the production of every individual commodity is constantly falling in all existing branches of social production., LINE: 1547, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: basi capitalist mode product whether extent materi product valu subject particular histor trend develop concern first place level individu commod result develop product labor time necessari product everi individu commod constantli fall branch social product
TEXT:  Hence, a ton of steel or a hundred pounds of potatoes represent a smaller and smaller mass of value. Or viewed the other way around: The same value has to be represented in larger and larger quantities of use-values., LINE: 1548, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: henc ton steel hundr pound potato repres smaller smaller mass valu way around valu ha quantiti use valu
TEXT:  But a clear tendency is also observable on the level of society as a whole. The increasing socialization of material production alters the composition of the aggregate social labor to the detriment of separate private labor and thus ultimately undermines the transformation of material wealth into value-wealth., LINE: 1549, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: clear tendenc also observ level societi whole increas social materi product composit aggreg social labor detriment separ privat labor thu ultim transform materi wealth valu wealth
TEXT:  As sketched out by Marx in the “Fragment on Machines” in the Grundrisse, this process reaches a critical threshold when the application of science replaces isolated individual labor as the main force of production., LINE: 1550, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: fragment machin process reach critic threshold applic scienc isol individu labor main forc product
TEXT:  Precisely as concerns the historicity of the value category, the presentation in the Grundrisse can certainly also serve as proof of the existence of “two Marxes.” On the one hand, the founder of the critique of political economy here thematizes the internal history of value particularly clearly and shows that the increasingly scientific character of production can ultimately only lead to one thing: “With that, production based on exchange value breaks down” (Marx 1973: 705)., LINE: 1551, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: precis concern histor valu categori present certainli also serv proof exist two one hand founder critiqu polit economi intern histori valu particularli clearli show increasingli scientif charact product ultim lead one thing product base exchang valu break
TEXT:  On the other hand, in his treatment of the prehistory of capitalism, Marx reverts to the usual standpoint of other value theories and ascribes something like a pre-capitalist existence to value. Hanno’s reflections on a “higher-level or general theory of socio-cultural development” have also to be seen on this background., LINE: 1552, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: hand treatment prehistori capit usual standpoint valu theori someth like capitalist exist valu reflect higher level gener theori cultur develop also seen background
TEXT:  Hanno refers to the changes in the orientation of Marx’s critical economic writings, and he writes: “Originally, Marx had in mind the elaboration of a general theory of socio-cultural development (the ‘materialist conception of history’), in order then, on the basis of it, to elaborate a specific theory of the capitalist economy as the presumed center of modern society., LINE: 1553, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: chang orient critic econom write origin mind elabor gener theori cultur develop materialist concept histori order basi elabor specif theori capitalist economi center modern societi
TEXT: ” Hanno regrets that this first part was not further developed, but rather remained just a project, and that in Capital, Marx limited himself to elaborating “a specific theory of the capitalist economy., LINE: 1554, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: regret first part wa rather project capit limit specif theori capitalist economi
TEXT: ” There was, however, a good reason for the shift away from the original plan and the narrow focus on the capitalist mode of production. Since, while working on Capital, Marx recognized value as a category that is proper only to the capitalist mode of production, he would have had to have founded a new type of general theory of socio-cultural development: a general theory that is not based on mystifying value as a trans-historical category., LINE: 1555, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: wa howev good reason shift away origin plan narrow focu capitalist mode product sinc work capit valu categori proper capitalist mode product would new type gener theori cultur develop gener theori base valu histor categori
TEXT:  As little as there is to be said, in principle, against the desire to have a higher-level theory of socio-cultural development, it should not result in an elimination of Marx’s critique of fetishism. Otherwise, “less is more” applies., LINE: 1556, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: littl said principl desir higher level theori cultur develop result elimin critiqu fetish otherwis less
TEXT:  Hanno Pahl It is not easy to provide a concise summary of our trialogue. What should have become clear is that it seems, in principle, to be fruitful to relate the value-critical or form-critical interpretations of Marxian theory to contemporary research questions in media theory and to see what perspectives for further reflection result., LINE: 1557, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: easi provid concis summari trialogu becom clear principl fruit relat valu critic form critic interpret theori contemporari research question medium theori see perspect reflect result
TEXT:  But the difficulties with which one could be confronted in doing so will also have been made plain. Ernst rightly notes that Marxian value theory represents an “erratic block in the scientific landscape” and that its methodological peculiarities give rise to “massive compatibility problems” in all attempts to bring it into relation with other, newer theoretical formats., LINE: 1558, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: difficulti one could also made plain rightli note valu theori errat block scientif landscap methodolog peculiar give rise massiv compat problem attempt bring relat theoret format
TEXT:  I think we largely agree that a dual strategy is required here: The genuine insights of the Marxian critique, its specific problematic, should not be undermined; otherwise, the whole procedure would prove to be pointless., LINE: 1559, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: think larg agre dual strategi genuin insight critiqu specif problemat otherwis whole procedur would prove pointless
TEXT:  At the same time, however, the often hermetic character of “Marxological” discourse should be pried open a bit, since ultimately it leads to self-isolation and to the apriori rejection of all possible extensions and renovations., LINE: 1560, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: time howev often hermet charact discours pri open bit sinc ultim lead self isol apriori reject possibl extens renov
TEXT:  With regard to our initial question on “money as medium or as commodity (set apart from the rest)?,” Jens’s inputs, in particular, have identified some possibilities. We can perhaps bring together these intentions into the fundamental question of whether we can go beyond the “semantics of mediation” deployed by Marx, in order to present the insights that it contains differently and, perhaps, more precisely (and to encourage debate about them)., LINE: 1561, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: regard initi question money medium commod set apart rest input particular possibl perhap bring togeth intent fundament question whether beyond semant mediat order present insight differ perhap precis encourag debat

TEXT:  Marx himself already re-functionalized the latter: above all, in order to give expression to his ideas with regard to real abstractions. We need to show what additional insights a media-materialist perspective can bring to light here: for example, concerning the further structural development of capitalism and hence with respect to the changing forms of value-objectification (“what functions when and how as the money commodity?”)., LINE: 1564, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: alreadi latter order give express idea regard real abstract need show addit insight medium materialist perspect bring light exampl concern structur develop capit henc respect form valu objectif function money commod

TEXT:  1Let us abstract here from the question concerning the relation between value and price, which leads directly into the depths of the so-called transformation problem. 2But Ernst also alludes to the fact that in the Grundrisse, Marx indeed writes explicitly that the “commodity achieves a double existence, not only a natural but also a purely economic existence, in which latter it is a mere symbol, a cipher for a relation of production, a mere symbol for its own value” (Marx 1973: 141)., LINE: 1585, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: let abstract question concern relat valu price lead directli depth transform problem also fact inde explicitli commod doubl exist natur also pure econom exist latter mere symbol cipher relat product mere symbol valu

TEXT: 1 by Ernst Lohoff. Following arguments by Marx (1976), Polanyi (1944) and Graeber (2011) it is the emphasis on the exchange rather than the use-value of things that allowed money to evolve through ever-new forms of commodification in economic development., LINE: 1605, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: follow argument emphasi exchang rather use valu thing money evolv ever new form econom develop

Section one follows an evolutionary political economy approach and derives historical, anthropological and theoretical transformations of early human societies and merchant societies with central arguments by Polanyi (1944) and Graeber (2011)., LINE: 1610, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: otherwis technolog seek origin mutat econom subject social order chapter follow way section one evolutionari polit economi approach histor anthropolog theoret transform earli human societi merchant societi central argument
TEXT:  It is shown how the historically specific money form settles the power topology of societies in general and thereby the sovereignty over labor productivity and consequently technological change.

TEXT:  Those early great transformations of economic subjectivity and the institutional money form have laid the foundations for the further development of more specialized mutations of capitalist economic subjectivities; a process of intensifying dividualization (Deleuze 1992)., LINE: 1612, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: earli great transform econom subject institut money form laid foundat develop special mutat capitalist econom subject process
TEXT:  In section two, we pay particular attention to the evolution of those novel specialized economic subjectivities in capitalism, the role of the institutional money form and technological change. Four different subjectivities are developed historically along specific money forms: (1) “the worker” and “simple commodity money,” (2) “the employee” and “differentiated wages,” (3) “the consumer,” and (4) “the debtor” are both associated with “private credit, money-capital or simply finance., LINE: 1613, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: section two pay particular attent evolut novel special econom subject capit role institut money form technolog chang four differ subject histor along specif money form worker simpl commod money employe wage consum debtor associ privat credit money capit simpli financ
TEXT: ” Every such character mask needs to be understood as a prototype identity of a set of heterogeneous agents for a certain capitalist economic period and not as a homogeneous representative agent. We set those developments roughly in relation to the historical development of “sovereign,” “discipline,” and “control/security” societies (Foucault 1975; Deleuze 1992; Lazzarato 2011)., LINE: 1614, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: everi charact mask need understood prototyp ident set heterogen agent certain capitalist econom period homogen repres agent set develop roughli relat histor develop sovereign disciplin control secur societi

TEXT:  However, this circumstance alone does not prohibit the evolution of a society after money. Section three takes a deeper look on the possibility of a society after money. Planetary-scale computation is considered as a major feature of “the second machine age” (Brynjolfsson and McAfee 2014) which we relate to the most recent technological advances with high institutional impact., LINE: 1616, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: howev circumst alon doe prohibit evolut societi money section three take look possibl societi money planetari scale comput consid major featur second machin age relat recent technolog advanc high institut impact
TEXT:  We elaborate on a specific reading of this technological shift in capitalist economic development, mainly the emergence of “The Stack.” Bratton (2015) discusses the origination of the stack as an “accidental megastructure” that constitutes itself along a “platform of platforms., LINE: 1617, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: elabor specif read technolog shift capitalist econom develop mainli emerg stack origin stack accident along platform platform

TEXT:  The opposite is more likely, i.e. the configuration of a “Black Stack” (Bratton 2015: 351–359).

TEXT:  After introducing functional perspectives on monies, we show its weaknesses and conceptualize monies as mirrors to societies’ power relations. Finally, we differentiate between monies in human, merchant and industrial societies to set the stage for discussing the relations between specific money forms and economic subjectivities in the second section of this chapter., LINE: 1625, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: function perspect show weak conceptu mirror societi power relat final differenti human merchant industri societi set stage relat specif money form econom subject second section chapter
TEXT:  The first accounts on money go back to Aristotle and define money through three functions for an economy based on barter (Schumpeter 1954: 57–62): medium of exchange (“catallactic”), store of value (“metallist”) and unit of account (“institutional”)., LINE: 1626, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: first account money back defin money three function economi base barter medium exchang catallact store valu unit account institut
TEXT:  Money facilitates direct exchange of two goods as a measure of value for both goods and enables the involved parties to store value over time. Today’s mainstream economists explain the emergence of money in the same vein, implying that money increased the efficiency of markets, is as such neutral, and does not affect production, circulation or consumption of economic values (compare Graeber 2011, Brodbeck 2012 or Wäckerle 2013)., LINE: 1627, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: money direct exchang two good measur valu good involv parti store valu time today economist explain emerg money vein money effici market neutral doe affect product circul consumpt econom valu compar
TEXT:  Congruently, monies facilitate not only exchange but also record obligations in numerical terms; thus debts.

However, the collection of debt has not been limited to their own citizens; but in particular, conquered societies were forced to pay taxes (Graeber 2011)., LINE: 1630, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: infrastructur built societi somebodi born howev collect debt ha limit citizen particular societi forc pay tax
TEXT:  Monies as debts have also been used to strategically provide the military with food: states collected monies (e.g. gold) from farmers that have been given to the military; subsequently farmers were forced to give food as exchange for gold to members of the military (Graeber 2011)., LINE: 1631, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: debt also use strateg provid militari food state collect gold farmer given militari subsequ farmer forc give food exchang gold member militari
TEXT:  Monies in these theories thus address and (re)route debt between agents put in place by powerful actors more or less legitimately. Finally, monies have also been used to compensate for losses, as for example in the case of Wodani people, where a clan receives monies when it loses a member due to murder or marriage (Breton 1999, 2000 and Cartelier 2006); or today in the case of a fine that expresses responsibility and recognizes debt in the case, for example, environmental damage (Kallis et al., LINE: 1632, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: theori thu address rout debt agent put place power actor less legitim final also use compens loss exampl case peopl clan member due murder marriag today case fine express respons debt case exampl environment damag
TEXT:  2013). In each of these perspectives, monies have certain functions, but they define the novelty of money, or money’s being-of-itself. One attempt of doing so is made by Brodbeck (2012: 345) who understands money as an agreement between two parties as part of an act of purchase in difference to an act of exchange., LINE: 1633, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: perspect certain function defin novelti money money one attempt made money agreement two parti part act purchas differ act exchang
TEXT:  Following him, exchange does not necessitate an equivalence between two traded goods, but only an internal identity of the two goods envisioned by each of the respective agent. An argument that stands in contrast to mainstream economic interpretations of exchange and money., LINE: 1634, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: follow exchang doe necessit equival two good intern ident two good respect agent argument stand contrast econom interpret exchang money
TEXT:  In an act of purchase, both parties assume money as a means of measurement. Hence money is one of the two exchanged commodities, and create equivalence or commensurability between the two goods. Repeated acts of purchase finally establish money in a society, as money is “reproduced through being again and again reciprocally recognized by the involved parties who use it” (Brodbeck 2012: 363)., LINE: 1635, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: act purchas parti assum money mean measur henc money one two commod creat equival two good repeat act purchas final establish money societi money reciproc involv parti use
TEXT:  Thereby money constitutes social reality because it is social reality and thus it is best understood as a circular-reflexive category as for example “power”.4 Although circular-reflexive categories lose significance from the moment their meaning is not restored or reproduced by the involved agents anymore (e., LINE: 1636, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: therebi money social realiti social realiti thu best understood circular reflex categori exampl power although circular reflex categori lose signific moment mean involv agent
TEXT: g. the king ceases to have power from the moment the tributary ceases to attribute power to him), they constitute social reality for those who are subject to it up to that point. To this extent, money in itself has no power, but is “a semblance […] which organizes social reality” (Brodbeck 2012: 301–305) and thus depends with regard to its form and applicability crucially on the society it is embedded in., LINE: 1637, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: king ceas power moment tributari ceas attribut power constitut social realiti subject point extent money ha power semblanc social realiti thu regard form applic crucial societi

TEXT:  One illustrative example is the Wodani people that use a variety of monies for compensations that mirror their belief system. Wodani people live in clans and conceive themselves to “reproduce the substance of Buba’s body (the primordial ancestor),” which is composed of a variety of organs., LINE: 1640, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: one illustr exampl peopl use varieti compens mirror belief system peopl live clan conceiv reproduc substanc buba bodi primordi ancestor compos varieti organ
TEXT:  In the same vein, following them, each individual is composed of the same organs.

TEXT:  Hence, the compensation is based on heterogeneous monies that cannot be aggregated, are not commensurable or considered ”equivalent to people” (Graeber 2011: 158) for which they compensate. In short, humans are equivalent to humans, and monies operate in certain ”spheres of exchange., LINE: 1642, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: henc compens base heterogen cannot commensur consid equival peopl compens short human equival human oper certain sphere exchang
TEXT: ” Such monies often emerge as “objects that are used primarily as adornment” (Graeber 2011: 145) of the respective person and are rather “creating” (ibid.) than substituting people. The Wodani monies are cases of “special purpose” monies, where each currency can only be used for a socially regulated specific purpose., LINE: 1643, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: often emerg object use primarili adorn respect person rather ibid substitut peopl case special purpos currenc use social regul specif purpos

TEXT: g. the trade of humans is not legal in major parts of the world).

TEXT:  Graeber (2011) gives several examples of such transformations and shows that women, in particular, are their victims. They may originate from community internal5 or community external6 forces.

TEXT:  To finance such processes the merchant class institutionalized all-purpose monies that, in complement to the appropriated technologies, set the stage for long-lasting capital accumulation processes. The next major transformation in the money form took place with industrial capitalism when large investments required new forms of money: endogenously generated credit money became the dominant money form, and commercial banks, the economic institutions that generate credit money, gained significant power., LINE: 1651, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: financ process merchant class purpos complement technolog set stage long last capit accumul process next major transform money form took place industri capit larg invest new form money endogen credit money domin money form commerci bank econom institut gener credit money signific power

Similarly to Graeber (2014), this analysis conceives the predecessor of the disciplinary societies as the “societies of sovereignty,” where it was common “… to tax rather than to organize production, to rule on death rather than to adminster life” (Deleuze 1992: 3)., LINE: 1683, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: made brilliant analysi prison core model subject similarli analysi predecessor disciplinari societi societi sovereignti wa common tax rather organ product rule death rather life

TEXT:  Labor productivity increases through novel machines and tools that have marginalized the value of workers’ skills and their handicraft. As Brenner and Glick (1991: 59) note: How else are we to understand Marx’s analysis of “Machinofacture” in Capital (published in 1867), which theorizes already-accomplished (though necessarily incomplete) processes of destruction of handicraft labor, subordination of workers to machines, and intensification of labor that were the consequence of the introduction of cost-cutting machinery and were every bit as spectacular as—and in many respects quite analogous to—the processes that occurred under the impetus of Taylorism-Fordism? The upshot of their analysis suggests that the “major transformations of the labor process” (at the turn to the twentieth century) are not to be considered as clean shifts from one model of capital accumulation to another., LINE: 1686, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: labor product increas novel machin tool valu worker skill handicraft note els understand analysi machinofactur capit alreadi accomplish though necessarili incomplet process destruct handicraft labor subordin worker machin intensif labor consequ introduct cost cut machineri everi bit spectacular mani respect quit analog process impetu upshot analysi major transform labor process turn twentieth centuri consid clean shift one model capit accumul anoth

TEXT:  Money is open to all households in controlled societies, we witness the times of rising consumer credit demand, especially after the Second World War. Furthermore, wages are not scarce and identical anymore, they are getting differentiated, modularized and compared within the new places of production: the corporation: “The factory constituted individuals as a single body to the double advantage of the boss who surveyed each element within the mass and the unions who mobilized a mass resistance; but the corporation constantly presents the brashest rivalry as a healthy form of emulation, an excellent motivational force that opposes individuals against one another and runs through each, dividing each within” (Deleuze 1992: 4–5)., LINE: 1692, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: money open household societi wit time rise consum credit demand especi second world war furthermor wage scarc ident get within new place product corpor factori individu singl bodi doubl advantag element within mass union mass resist corpor constantli present rivalri healthi form emul excel motiv forc individu one anoth run divid within

TEXT:  Types of machines are easily matched with each type of society—not that machines are determining, but because they express those social forms capable of generating them and using them. The old societies of sovereignty made use of simple machines—levers, pulleys, clocks; but the recent disciplinary societies equipped themselves with machines involving energy, with the passive danger of entropy and the active danger of sabotage; the societies of control operate with machines of a third type, computers, whose passive danger is jamming and whose active one is piracy and the introduction of viruses., LINE: 1694, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: type machin easili type societi machin express social form capabl gener old societi sovereignti made use simpl machin lever pulley clock recent disciplinari societi machin energi passiv danger entropi activ danger sabotag societi control oper machin third type comput whose passiv danger whose activ one piraci introduct viru

TEXT:  Karl Marx once argued in the Grundrisse: But, once adopted into the production process of capital, the means of labor passes through different metamorphoses, whose culmination is the machine, or rather, an automatic system of machinery (system of machinery: the automatic one is merely its most complete, most adequate form, and alone transforms machinery into a system), set in motion by an automaton, a moving power that moves itself; this automaton consisting of numerous mechanical and intellectual organs, so that the workers themselves are cast merely as its conscious linkages., LINE: 1712, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: adopt product process capit mean labor pass differ metamorphosi whose culmin machin rather automat system machineri system machineri automat one mere complet adequ form alon machineri system set motion automaton move power move automaton numer mechan intellectu organ worker cast mere consciou linkag

TEXT:  Since ownership and control of capital-money (…) is crucial to maintaining populations bonded to the current power relation, how can we turn financial money into the money of the common? An experiment such as Bitcoin demonstrates that in a way “the taboo on money has been broken”, and that beyond the limits of this experience, forkings are already developing in different directions., LINE: 1753, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: sinc ownership control capit money crucial popul bond current power relat turn financi money money common experi way taboo money ha broken beyond limit experi alreadi differ direct
TEXT:  What kind of relationship can be established between the algorithms of money-creation and “a constituent practice which affirms other criteria for the measurement of wealth, valorizing new and old collective needs outside the logic of finance”? Terranova 2014: 391 We think that Terranova (2014) is addressing the right questions in this matter, by shifting the attention to the modalities of money as a symbolic carrier system of social values, and highlighting the potential of money as a common and not a capital good., LINE: 1754, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: kind relationship establish algorithm money creation constitu practic criterion measur wealth new old collect need outsid logic financ think right question matter shift attent modal money symbol carrier system social valu potenti money common capit good
TEXT:  In the same vein as Meretz (2017), Terranova (2014) suggests developing “commonism,” or working on the “commonfare” as Fumagalli and Lucarelli (2015) outline. These rather novel conceptions are very promising but need more detailed integration into an evolutionary political economy framework., LINE: 1755, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: vein work outlin rather novel concept promis need detail integr evolutionari polit economi framework
TEXT:  Furthermore, digital monies head into a similar direction, with respect to a rebalancing of power and control over current money-capital. The most prominent example is Bitcoin, which is of interest for the technological innovation of the Blockchain algorithm, but also its free market regulatory and discursive framework., LINE: 1756, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: furthermor digit head similar direct respect power control current money capit promin exampl interest technolog innov algorithm also free market regulatori discurs framework
TEXT:  With regard to the latter, Bitcoin founders and advocates praise Bitcoin for properties that have been used to uphold the Gold Standard about 100 years ago. Arguments that resemble a form of “digital metallism” are not only found in the language used to describe Bitcoin (Bitcoins are “mined” like gold), but also the regulatory framing of the algorithm, which curbs the mining of Bitcoins and limits them to in total 21 million (see e., LINE: 1757, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: regard latter founder advoc prais properti use uphold gold standard year ago argument resembl form digit metal found languag use describ like gold also regulatori frame algorithm curb mine limit total million see

TEXT:  While advocating a decentralized ledger, by now the competition has led to a concentration of a few specialized computer centers. Already in 2011, 30 percent of all Bitcoins have been added by seven mining pools., LINE: 1759, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: ledger competit ha led concentr special comput center alreadi percent ad seven mine pool
TEXT:  Since the system relies on a decentralized validation, when more than 50 percent of the miners agree to betray the system, the validity of the system fails. The likelihood for such a 51 percent attack is more likely when concentration increases (Beikverdi and Song 2015)., LINE: 1760, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: sinc system valid percent miner agre betray system valid system likelihood percent attack like concentr increas song
TEXT:  Further, most of the computational centers are located in Iceland for the cheap energy and cooling supply, signifying the energy intensity of the validating competition mechanism. Recent estimates show that Bitcoin by now uses about the same amount of energy as Irish national energy consumption (O’Dwyer et al., LINE: 1761, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: comput center iceland cheap energi cool suppli energi intens competit mechan recent estim show us amount energi nation energi consumpt
TEXT:  2016). This process implies a “direct reference to the heat and carbon at the real bottom of this particular financial stack” (Bratton 2015: 337). Arguments that suggest Bitcoins represent the values of energy or cooling power, however, fall in the same fallacies as those advocates that identified the value of gold in its physical form and not in the social processes creating the semblance of money., LINE: 1762, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: process direct refer heat carbon real bottom particular financi stack argument suggest repres valu energi cool power howev fall fallaci advoc valu gold physic form social process semblanc money
TEXT:  In the context of Bitcoin, these arguments are in line with the emerging power of technological-institutional complexes that appropriate “neutral” technologies. However, the legitimacy of Bitcoin is created through an ideologically programmed algorithm, while the regulatory frame of the use of Bitcoin circumvents socially regulated territories., LINE: 1763, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: context argument line power technolog institut complex appropri neutral technolog howev legitimaci ideolog algorithm regulatori frame use social regul territori
TEXT:  Bitcoin is available as an all-purpose money to equalize money values with lives in trade of slaves, prostitutes, weapons and drugs, and thus resembles a (de)regulation and (re)territorialization of money through the rules underlying its algorithm (see also Bratton 2015)., LINE: 1764, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: avail purpos money equal money valu life trade slave prostitut weapon drug thu regul money rule underli algorithm see also
TEXT:  The Blockchain technology, however, also provides new avenues. One example could be the Bancor, a framework that is named by a universal international exchange currency once suggested by Keynes. Bancor combines Smart Contracts (thus pre-defined algorithmic routines for exchange) with Blockchain technology to facilitate exchange between digital currencies., LINE: 1765, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: technolog howev also new avenu one exampl could framework univers intern exchang currenc combin smart contract thu defin algorithm routin exchang technolog facilit exchang digit currenc
TEXT:  Each Bancor consists of two digital currencies. The Smart Contract defines the ratio between the two currencies that figures in the calculation of the exchange value of the respective Bancor. Thus, the exchange value of each bancor is calculated endogenously in each Bancor and thus Bancor can, by design, be exchanged at any time., LINE: 1766, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: two digit currenc smart contract ratio two currenc figur calcul exchang valu respect thu exchang valu calcul endogen thu design time
TEXT:  Bancor provides thereby an open available framework for monetary exchange and a preliminary “algorithmic matching protocol.” Technologies such as Bancor, could, for example, facilitate moderate shifts in the monetary system., LINE: 1767, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: therebi open avail framework monetari exchang preliminari algorithm match protocol technolog could exampl facilit moder shift monetari system
TEXT:  Recently Varoufakis (2016) suggested an international digital currency, issued and regulated by the IMF. The idea resembles Keynes’ suggestions of the Bancor but enriches it with algorithmic governance, which would enable variable exchange rates, certain regulations and minimize discretionary power., LINE: 1768, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: recent intern digit currenc regul idea suggest algorithm govern would enabl variabl exchang rate certain regul minim discretionari power
TEXT:  Transparent Smart Contracts in combination with Blockchain could facilitate such regulatory schemes.

TEXT:  For example, rules that put a trade-imbalance levy on current-account deficits or surpluses, paid by member states could be implemented to tax capital flight. Both would increase the stability for national economies, reduce herd-like capital flows and sanction speculation., LINE: 1770, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: exampl rule put trade imbal levi current account deficit surplu member state could tax capit flight would increas stabil nation economi reduc herd like capit flow sanction specul
TEXT:  Lastly, an implementation through algorithms would minimize the discretionary power of politicians and bureaucrats over capital transfers. The gained income of such scheme could then be used for “research and development dedicated to green energy and sustainable technologies” (ibid., LINE: 1771, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: lastli implement algorithm would minim discretionari power politician bureaucrat capit transfer incom scheme could use research develop green energi sustain technolog ibid

TEXT:  Jappe 2011 For most of us, there appears to be no alternative to economic activity with money. The land of milk and honey is a fairytale. But perhaps there is something more serious to be found in fantasy or utopian novels, or in works of science fiction? Money is a scarce commodity in such works, not because money has been abolished in all these fictional visions of the future, but because the subject of money hardly features at all., LINE: 1823, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: altern econom activ money land milk honey perhap someth seriou found fantasi utopian novel work scienc fiction money scarc commod work money ha fiction vision futur subject money hardli featur

TEXT:  If this does occur it is most often in texts that construct an ideal city or state. These are usually characterized by a “consistently objective and strictly systematic presentation” (Marzin 1986: 12), and the “absence of a plot in the proper sense” (ibid., LINE: 1825, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: doe occur often text construct ideal citi state usual consist object strictli systemat present absenc plot proper sens ibid
TEXT: ). In science fiction, in contrast, the “future world is shown via the plot” (ibid.: 11), and there is no coherent depiction of the economic foundation. Science fiction is mainly inspired by anticipated advances in technology, which are seen as dictating changes in humans and in social conditions—rather than vice versa., LINE: 1826, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: scienc fiction contrast futur world shown via plot ibid coher depict econom foundat scienc fiction mainli inspir advanc technolog seen chang human social condit rather vice
TEXT:  Utopias, on the other hand, are mainly concerned with human relationships, to which science and technology are subordinated. These differences could become significant in the search for fictional worlds without money, depending on whether money is understood more as a technical means of organizing human activities, or as an expression of societal relations between individuals., LINE: 1827, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: utopia hand mainli concern human relationship scienc technolog differ could becom signific search fiction world without money depend whether money understood technic mean human activ express societ relat individu

TEXT:  However, it was felt that the use of money should be strictly subject to factual necessity, and should not become an end in itself.

TEXT:  In his text The Laws (around 345 BC), Plato (428/427–348/347 BC) argued that, because of the need for stability, money must only be used “for purposes of … daily exchange,” but that there should also be a law “which forbids any private person to possess any gold or silver” (Plato, Laws: 371)., LINE: 1836, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: text law around need stabil money must use purpos daili exchang also law privat person possess gold silver law

TEXT:  The latter “is justly regarded with disapproval,” according to Aristotle, because “it arises not from nature but from men’s gaining from each other” (ibid.: 87 (1258 a 19–1258 b 2)). Gold and Silver for Chamber Pots in the Early Modern Period Thomas More (1478–1535) reacted to the consequences of incipient capitalism with his work Utopia (1516, original title: De optimo statu rei publicae deque nova insula Utopia)., LINE: 1838, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: latter justli disapprov accord natur men gain ibid gold silver chamber pot earli modern period consequ incipi capit work utopia origin titl nova insula utopia
TEXT:  In everyday economic life in Utopia there is no money, because it only brings evil into the world: “Everyone could so easily get enough to eat, if it weren’t for that blessed nuisance, money.

TEXT:  One writer who explicitly denounced the existence of money was Étienne Cabet (1788–1856), with his utopia of a communist polity entitled Voyage en Icarie (Travels in Icaria, 1840). The Icarians have “neither property nor money, nor selling nor buying” (Cabet [1840] 2003: 81), and the planning, the organization of production and the distribution of goods is carried out by “the republic, or the community” (ibid., LINE: 1848, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: one writer explicitli exist money wa utopia communist politi voyag travel neither properti money sell organ product distribut good carri republ commun ibid
TEXT: : 82). Visions of the Future in the Industrial Society Still traveling hopefully toward the revolution, August Bebel (1840–1913) gave concrete form to ideas of a socialist future after the revolution in his 1872 text Die Frau und der Sozialismus (Woman and Socialism)., LINE: 1849, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: vision futur industri societi still travel hope toward revolut august gave concret form idea socialist futur revolut text die woman social

TEXT:  Distribution would be based on labor certificates, as Marx would propose three years later for the initial phase of communism (Marx [1875] 1983: 20). In Bebel’s words: “It can easily be calculated how much social labor will be necessary for the manufacture of each product., LINE: 1851, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: distribut would base labor certif would propos three year later initi phase commun word easili calcul much social labor necessari manufactur product
TEXT: … Any kind of certificate, a printed piece of paper, gold or tin, enables the holder to exchange same for various kinds of commodities” (Bebel [1872] 1910: 398). These labor certificates are not money, because “We should like to know how a member of socialistic society could ‘hoard’ his gold working certificate or could even loan it on interest, when all the others also own what the one offers and—on which he lives” (ibid., LINE: 1852, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: kind certif print piec paper gold tin holder exchang variou kind commod labor certif money like know member socialist societi could hoard gold work certif could even loan interest also one offer life ibid

In the year 2000, in this utopia, money has been completely abolished (Bellamy [1888] 2007: 40)., LINE: 1853, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: novel look backward led found dozen associ peopl make utopia realiti year utopia money ha complet
TEXT:  International relations are conducted by means of an “international council” rather than markets (ibid.: 40). Goods are allocated to the people on the basis of credit, which is granted to each person per year in accordance with his or her share of total annual production—regardless of individual performance (ibid., LINE: 1854, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: intern relat mean intern council rather market ibid good peopl basi credit person per year accord share total annual product regardless individu perform ibid
TEXT: : 14). The goods are assigned a “price” which corresponds to the costs of their production (ibid.: 63). The vouchers are still called “dollars”: “We have kept the old word, but not the substance. The term, as we use it, answers to no real thing, but merely serves as an algebraical symbol for comparing the values of products with one another” (ibid., LINE: 1855, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: good assign price cost product ibid voucher still dollar kept old word substanc term use answer real thing mere serf algebra symbol valu product one anoth ibid
TEXT: : 14). Alexander A. Bogdanov (1873–1928) also made an extremely important contribution to a future socialism. In his two utopian books, Red Star (1907) and Engineer Menni (1912), he outlined, among other things, a mechanism for the organization of labor: “a self-organizing supersystem without that fatal wasting of energy which was an unavoidable consequence of all lower stages of development” (Rollberg 1988: 294)., LINE: 1856, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: also made extrem import contribut futur social two utopian book red star engin outlin among thing mechan organ labor self supersystem without fatal wast energi wa unavoid consequ lower stage develop

In the novel Ecotopia ([1975] 1990) and the subsequently written prequel to this utopia, Ecotopia Emerging (1981), by Ernest Callenbach (1929–2012), the means of production are transferred to the ownership of those who work with them (Callenbach [1975] 1990: 97–99, Callenbach [1981] 1982: 37, 129)., LINE: 1865, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: tell public opinion stand social conscienc novel subsequ written utopia mean product transfer ownership work

TEXT:  In the classical utopias, virtue always takes priority over wealth. The early modern utopias are also content with what is already available. In Thomas More’s Utopia, distribution takes place via depots in the middle of every district, where the head of a household can receive everything “without any sort of payment, either in money or in kind”: “There’s more than enough of everything to go round—for why should anyone want to start hoarding, when he knows he’ll never have to go short of anything?” (More [1516] 1965: 80)., LINE: 1902, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: classic utopia virtu alway take prioriti wealth earli modern utopia also content alreadi avail utopia distribut take place via depot middl everi district head household receiv everyth without sort payment either money kind enough everyth round anyon want start hoard know never short anyth

TEXT: : ch. 5). Everyone Joins in the Work If there is no money to function as a motivation for work, the authors of the utopias must consider why people would nonetheless do sufficient work.

TEXT: : 399) is not so much targeted at laziness in people in general, as against the previous exemption of the rich. “The scriptural saying: ‘In the sweat of thy brow shalt thou eat thy bread,’ will then prevail with the heroes of the stock-exchange and the drones of capitalism, also” (ibid., LINE: 1919, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: much target lazi peopl gener previou exempt rich scriptur say sweat thi brow shalt thou eat thi bread prevail hero stock exchang drone capit also ibid

Science and Technology Science and Technology to Make Work Easier and Eliminate Scarcity Aristotle had already speculated about the possibility of using technological progress to overcome the subordination of servants and slaves: for “if … shuttles in a loom could fly to and fro and a plucker play a lyre of their own accord, then master craftsmen would not want servants, nor masters slaves” (Aristotle, Politics, 65, 1253 b 18)., LINE: 1925, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: percent peopl ever live life unparallel luxuri scienc technolog scienc technolog make work easier elimin scarciti alreadi possibl technolog progress overcom subordin servant slave shuttl loom could fli fro plucker play lyre accord master craftsman would want servant master slave polit
TEXT:  In Campanella’s City of the Sun, technical innovations are greatly appreciated. For example, a door is described that “can be raised and let down … by a marvelous device” (Campanella [1602] 2013).

TEXT:  The urge to be active is inherent in beings gifted with reason, whose abilities are lovingly tended” (del Antonio [1959] 1985: 354–355).

TEXT:  The father is still characterized by isolation and coldness (Bogdanov [1912] 1984: 193)—it is only in the son that the personality can develop in the person (ibid.: 205). This leads to the emergence of a “qualitatively new type of interpersonal relationship—“cooperative collaboration”—, [which] is characterized by the generation of rational norms, by individual freedom, personal responsibility, equal rights, and discursive, collective problem-solving” (Soboleva 2008: 4)., LINE: 1959, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: father still isol cold son person develop person ibid lead emerg qualit new type interperson relationship collabor gener ration norm individu freedom person respons equal right discurs collect problem
TEXT:  Of course human relationships will not be conflict-free even with other structures of ownership, as emphasized by Kim Stanley Robinson in the anthology of short stories Martians (1999). He writes: “people are still people; argue, resent, hate, are selfish, will share only with kin or those they know, if that is what you mean by ‘human nature’; but are now in an economic framework where they are roughly equal to those they despise, and cannot grossly oppress or be oppressed by them, financially” (Robinson 1999: 201)., LINE: 1960, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: cours human relationship conflict free even structur ownership kim antholog short stori peopl still peopl argu resent hate selfish share kin know mean human natur econom framework roughli equal despis cannot grossli oppress oppress financi

TEXT:  8), that is, humans are “just barely intelligent tool users .… sadly deficient in smarts” (ibid.: ch. 7). Not Everything Is Better Without Money If it is not possible to develop a higher form of society, then dispensing with money can also have disadvantages, as Marx already knew: “Strike out money, and one would thereby either be thrown back to a lower stage of production (corresponding to that of auxiliary barter), or one would proceed to a higher stage, in which exchange value would no longer be the principal aspect of the commodity, because social labor, whose representative it is, would no longer appear merely as socially mediated private labor” (Marx [1939] 1973: 214)., LINE: 1964, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: human bare intellig tool user sadli defici smart ibid everyth better without money possibl develop higher form societi money also disadvantag alreadi knew strike money one would therebi either thrown back lower stage product correspond auxiliari barter one would proceed higher stage exchang valu would longer princip aspect commod social labor whose repres would longer appear mere social privat labor
TEXT:  This situation is depicted in Reinmar Cunis’s (1933–1989) novel Wenn der Krebsbaum blüht [When the Crabtree Blooms, 1987].

TEXT:  In other utopias without money, social control is used to regulate work and consumption, as in the story of “Idle Jack” in Russell’s “And Then There Were None.” So if new social structures of mediation are to replace the mediating function of money, they must on the one hand be able to deal with restrictions on the available goods, possibly arising for ecological reasons, and on the other hand avoid surrendering the regulation of highly complex and global process chains to new fetish-like structures in the form of digital algorithms., LINE: 1966, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: utopia without money social control use regul work consumpt stori idl jack none new social structur mediat replac mediat function money must one hand abl deal restrict avail good possibl ecolog reason hand avoid regul highli complex global process chain new fetish like structur form digit algorithm

TEXT:  Hence the title chosen by the artists Chris Kondek and Christiane Kühl for their science fiction theater play Unser Geld ist ein Alien [Our money is an alien] (Becker 2010).

TEXT:  Only Ernest Callenbach and Ursula le Guin raised the possibility of limiting the volume of production for ecological reasons.

TEXT:  The reason why money or forms of mediation similar to money are still accepted in many utopias is undoubtedly that not all money is seen as serving to oppress other people. Marx also distinguished between a mere “monetary function” and money as capital, based on the class relations between the owners of the means of production and the doubly free proletarians: “But money appears very early on as a buyer of so-called services, without its being transformed into money capital, and without any revolution in the general character of the economy” (Marx [1867] 1978: 114)., LINE: 1973, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: reason money form mediat similar money still accept mani utopia undoubtedli money seen serv oppress peopl also distinguish mere monetari function money capit base class relat owner mean product doubli free proletarian money earli buyer servic without money capit without revolut gener charact economi
TEXT:  “As long as these operations are directed against money as such, they are merely an attack on consequences whose causes remain unaffected” (Marx [1939] 1973: 240).

TEXT:  The dictionary article quoted above does recognize money as a phenomenon of limited historical duration, but seems to posit exchange as more or less universal: The transition from the barter economy to the monetary economy began with what was initially a local custom: dividing the previously simultaneous exchange of two goods or services into separate processes of buying and selling by agreeing on an intermediary exchange good (Zwischentauschgut)., LINE: 2023, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: dictionari articl doe recogn money phenomenon limit histor durat posit exchang less univers transit barter economi monetari economi wa initi local custom divid previous simultan exchang two good servic separ process sell agre intermediari exchang good

TEXT:  1.1 Money, Exchange and Markets in Subsistence-Oriented and Peasant Economies The economic anthropologist George Dalton—a student of Polanyi, who can hardly be suspected of an uncritical generalization of capitalist conditions—observes: “[E]very society … has an economy of some sort because personal and community life require the structured provision of material goods and services” (Dalton 1971: 25)., LINE: 2027, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: money exchang market subsist peasant economi econom anthropologist dalton student hardli suspect uncrit gener capitalist condit societi ha economi sort person commun life requir structur provis materi good servic dalton
TEXT:  This process is never left to chance, because if it worked too poorly (or did not work at all) this could soon lead to hardship and death (ibid. 31). In this sense, then, it makes sense to speak of an “economy” even in relation to pre-capitalist or non-capitalist societies, referring to this structured process of provision for present and future needs., LINE: 2028, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: process never left chanc work poorli work could soon lead hardship death ibid sens make sens speak economi even relat capitalist non capitalist societi structur process provis present futur need
TEXT:  The process exists in every society, but it is only in capitalism that it takes the particular form of a multitude of private, competing firms, aiming to maximize their profits. Dalton (1971: 31f.) also notes that not all but most economies have external trade, markets, certain forms of money, and some kind of accounting devices—so much for the idea of money as a specifically capitalist phenomenon., LINE: 2029, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: process everi societi capit take particular form multitud privat firm aim maxim profit dalton also note economi extern trade market certain form money kind account devic much idea money specif capitalist phenomenon

TEXT:  While there are clear differences between different modes of production, these are more subtle than we might think. One difference is that in subsistence-oriented economies external trade is only used for the import of goods that are not available locally, while in the capitalist global economy it is based on the principle of cost minimization (the least-cost principle; Dalton 1971: 58)., LINE: 2032, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: clear differ differ mode product subtl might think one differ subsist economi extern trade use import good avail local capitalist global economi base principl cost minim least cost principl dalton

TEXT:  Most people are not dependent on successful market transactions to secure their livelihood; instead this is ensured by subsistence production in the framework of small groups (ibid.). In capitalism, individuals, households and firms are faced with innumerable choices: which of the countless goods they should buy, what occupation they should specialize in, what kinds of goods they should produce, and what technologies they should use to do so., LINE: 2034, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: peopl depend success market transact secur livelihood instead subsist product framework small group ibid capit individu household firm face innumer choic countless good buy occup special kind good produc technolog use
TEXT:  Many of these choices take the form of monetary calculations, or these at least play a certain part (Dalton 1971: 78). In subsistence economies, on the other hand, the choices are much more limited—because people mainly produce for their own use, and because the existing ecological and technological conditions, with a low level of technological development, often present few options., LINE: 2035, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: mani choic take form monetari calcul least play certain part dalton subsist economi hand choic much limit peopl mainli produc use ecolog technolog condit low level technolog develop often present option

TEXT:  They are supplemented by a few dozen other kinds of goods or services which are only occasionally needed and are if necessary procured from specialists (Dalton 1971: 90).

TEXT:  Most families work their own land and make many of their tools themselves; wage labor exists, but most people are not wage laborers. Since hardly anyone is solely dependent on the market to secure their livelihood, the fierce competition for market shares is absent, as is the need to produce as efficiently as possible and to sell as much as possible., LINE: 2042, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: famili work land make mani tool wage labor peopl wage labor sinc hardli anyon sole depend market secur livelihood fierc competit market share absent need produc effici possibl sell much possibl

TEXT:  Instead land is often distributed according to principles of status.

TEXT:  This land can be lent but not sold; if the household gives it up, it reverts to the community. The right to the labor of others is not usually gained by employing wage laborers, but by way of kinship (family members join in the work) and reciprocity (for big projects, all the families work together; Dalton 1971: 127f., LINE: 2045, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: land lent sold household give commun right labor usual wage labor way kinship famili member join work reciproc big project famili work togeth dalton
TEXT: ). Traditionally, markets were only of secondary importance in Africa; the majority of production was organized by means of reciprocity and redistribution (Dalton 1971: 134). This distinction between different principles of production has its origins in the work of the economic historian Karl Polanyi ([1944] 2001), who differentiates between market exchange, redistribution, and reciprocity., LINE: 2046, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: tradit market secondari import major product wa organ mean reciproc redistribut dalton distinct differ principl product ha origin work econom historian market exchang redistribut reciproc
TEXT:  Redistribution means that a central political authority demands certain contributions, and then distributes the resources gathered in this way in accordance with political decisions. Usually all these principles (or at least two out of three) play a part in the organization of society, but different societies vary in terms of how the principles relate to each other, and which of them is dominant., LINE: 2047, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: redistribut mean central polit author demand certain contribut resourc way accord polit decis usual principl least two three play part organ societi differ societi vari term principl relat domin

TEXT:  Here reciprocity must not be confused with “voluntariness”; instead it is based on clear social rules (Dalton 1971: 27, 53). Even today, if someone has given us a birthday present, it is difficult to imagine going to their next birthday party empty-handed, or if someone has helped us move to a new house we cannot refuse to help with their next move, unless there is a good reason., LINE: 2049, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: reciproc must confus voluntari instead base clear social rule dalton even today someon ha given birthday present difficult imagin go next birthday parti empti hand someon ha move new hous cannot refus help next move unless good reason
TEXT:  As there were markets for certain products in many societies, without market exchange being the socially dominant principle, Dalton (1971: 144) distinguishes between market places on the one hand, and the market principle or market mechanism on the other., LINE: 2050, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: market certain product mani societi without market exchang social domin principl dalton market place one hand market principl market mechan
TEXT:  Market places are specific locations where things are bought and sold, while the market mechanism ensures that nearly everything—including labor and raw materials—is traded at market prices, regardless of particular locations., LINE: 2051, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: market place specif locat thing bought sold market mechan nearli everyth labor raw materi market price regardless particular locat
TEXT:  While a weekly market is a specific place, the “labor market” is a social institution. In feudal Europe there were markets (especially in the towns) for some types of products (especially foodstuffs), but there was no market principle; land and labor were seldom sold., LINE: 2052, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: weekli market specif place labor market social institut feudal market especi town type product especi foodstuff wa market principl land labor seldom sold
TEXT:  Instead land was made available by redistribution in relations of dependence: feudal lords granted their vassals land for farming, and demanded contributions—in kind or in labor—in return (Dalton 1971: 223)., LINE: 2053, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: instead land wa made avail redistribut relat depend feudal lord vassal land farm contribut kind labor return dalton
TEXT:  In general the vassal had a lifelong right to farm the land, as long as he paid the contributions demanded, and he could hand this right down, but not sell it. Access to labor was based on the principle of reciprocity: the whole family joined in the work, and on special occasions such as the harvest, all the families helped each other out., LINE: 2054, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: gener vassal lifelong right farm land long contribut could hand right sell access labor wa base principl reciproc whole famili work special occas harvest famili
TEXT:  Occasionally day laborers were hired, but this tended to be the exception (ibid.: 226f.). Nonetheless, market places can be very important for buyers even in societies where the market principle plays only a secondary role, because there are some goods they can only acquire on the market (Dalton 1971: 150)., LINE: 2055, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: occasion day labor hire except ibid nonetheless market place import buyer even societi market principl play secondari role good acquir market dalton
TEXT:  So it would be wrong to conclude that, without the market principle, market places and paid transactions were an unnecessary extra.

TEXT:  Often goods were exchanged for other goods, as there was no universal money that both sides would have recognized (Dalton 1971: 154). In this respect, external trade did actually correspond to the “barter economy” conjured up in the economics narrative, yet this is only a small, albeit essential segment within modes of production that were otherwise governed by different rules., LINE: 2058, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: often good good wa univers money side would dalton respect extern trade actual correspond barter economi econom narr yet small albeit essenti segment within mode product otherwis differ rule

TEXT:  2. Distribution Without Money? Today the distribution of many goods works via money. If we want to acquire a good we pay the price set for it and gain access to it in return.

TEXT:  How could all this work without payment? One possibility is “taking what you need”; here there are two alternatives, depending on how “need” is defined. Does every person decide subjectively, as he or she sees fit, or is need defined by social institutions, according to objectively formulated criteria?

TEXT:  Today, for example, statutory health insurance in Germany and other European states mainly works this way.

TEXT:  But regardless of the concrete mode of production, it should be clear that in the case of material goods and services it would probably not be possible to avoid a demand surplus at least in some cases (a demand surplus arises when the number of people wanting to use a particular good, made available at a price of zero, exceeds the quantity of the commodity that is available)., LINE: 2087, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: regardless concret mode product clear case materi good servic would probabl possibl avoid demand surplu least case demand surplu number peopl want use particular good made avail price zero quantiti commod avail

TEXT:  Thus the “help yourself” principle appears to be the appropriate mode of distribution for information products, though admittedly this does not answer the question of how they are to be produced. But how can material goods and services be distributed if there is a demand surplus? One possible way to solve this is to leave it to the producers to decide who will have the available goods., LINE: 2089, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: thu help principl appropri mode distribut inform product though admittedli doe answer question produc materi good servic distribut demand surplu one possibl way solv leav produc decid avail good

TEXT:  I therefore refer to it as “high-tech subsistence” (cf. Kratzwald 2014: 122).

TEXT:  Whether there would then still be computers and reliable sources of power, the essential prerequisites for high-tech solutions such as 3D printers, is doubtful: a “post-collapse society” (Heimrath 2012) would probably be forced to return to low-tech subsistence., LINE: 2096, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: whether would still comput reliabl sourc power essenti prerequisit high tech solut printer doubt post collaps societi would probabl forc return low tech subsist
TEXT:  But even if high-tech subsistence were still an option, production in small groups—which can organize themselves spontaneously and without money—would probably leave much to be desired. And in the case of cooperation in large groups, the question that again arises is: “How does the division of tasks and goods function without money, compulsion, or excessive bureaucracy?”—a question that is still relatively easy to resolve in small-scale subsistence production., LINE: 2097, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: even high tech subsist still option product small group organ spontan without money would probabl leav much desir case larg group question doe divis task good function without money compuls excess bureaucraci question still rel easi resolv small scale subsist product

TEXT:  When products are needed in greater quantities, industrial mass production is still the more efficient option. Thus the subsistence perspective, even in its high-tech version, seems set to remain a “second-choice” way of life: anyone who is still able to find a reasonably well-paid job in capitalism is likely to see the great range of cheaply manufactured mass-produced goods as more attractive., LINE: 2101, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: product greater quantiti industri mass product still effici option thu subsist perspect even high tech version set remain second choic way life anyon still abl find reason well job capit like see great rang cheapli mass produc good attract

TEXT:  This condition would probably only be fulfilled if post-capitalist society could also, in many cases, produce things in great quantities and with a high degree of division of labor, and if the producers were willing to use only a small proportion of the goods they produced themselves., LINE: 2104, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: condit would probabl post capitalist societi could also mani case produc thing great quantiti high degre divis labor produc will use small proport good produc
TEXT:  Which brings us back to the question of the “money-free” distribution of the remaining goods. One conceivable version would be a system of nepotism or cronyism: the producers decide who will receive their products on the basis of personal acquaintance and favor., LINE: 2105, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: back question money free distribut good one conceiv version would system nepot produc decid receiv product basi person acquaint favor
TEXT:  In such a society, personal relationships would be everything; a loner or misfit would remain poor and probably die early, because the relatives and acquaintances of the doctors and nurses would be given preferential treatment in hospitals., LINE: 2106, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: societi person relationship would everyth misfit would remain poor probabl die earli rel acquaint doctor nurs would given preferenti treatment hospit
TEXT:  So society would certainly not be improved if money were replaced by personal relationships! This leaves other variations in which the producers do not decide as they see fit, but products are instead distributed on the basis of a general system negotiated within society., LINE: 2107, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: societi would certainli money person relationship leaf variat produc decid see fit product instead distribut basi gener system within societi
TEXT:  Just as a reminder, we are only talking about how a demand surplus is dealt with: those cases where somebody would end up empty-handed if everyone were simply to help themselves. Various “money-free” solutions to this problem could be found, for example: •First come, first served (FCFS): everyone can help themselves to all available products; but if the shelves are empty, you are out of luck., LINE: 2108, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: remind talk demand surplu dealt case somebodi would end empti hand everyon simpli help variou money free solut problem could found exampl first come first everyon help avail product shelf empti luck
TEXT:  •Distribution by lot: anyone who wants to have a particular kind of product puts their name on a list; lots are then drawn to distribute the available goods among those on the list. •Rationing: for each scarce product category, those responsible determine exactly who is allowed to consume how much of it, so ideally no one ends up empty-handed., LINE: 2109, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: distribut lot anyon want particular kind product put name list lot drawn distribut avail good among list scarc product categori respons determin exactli consum much ideal one end empti hand
TEXT:  Although all these methods are fundamentally fair, none of them is altogether convincing. FCFS causes stress, because for every potentially scarce commodity one has to be sure to be on the spot at the right time, when the next distribution is due to happen., LINE: 2110, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: although method fundament fair none altogeth convinc caus stress everi potenti scarc commod one ha sure spot right time next distribut due happen
TEXT:  Furthermore, the method is susceptible to nepotism or cronyism, with insiders passing on information to friends and acquaintances about when something will be distributed. Distribution by lot is totally arbitrary and also susceptible to manipulation., LINE: 2111, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: furthermor method suscept nepot insid pass inform friend acquaint someth distribut distribut lot total arbitrari also suscept manipul
TEXT:  It is possible to increase one’s own chances by asking friends to apply for the desired good as well, and to pass it on if they win. And the rationing process would force everyone into the same mold, without taking into consideration the divergence between individual needs., LINE: 2112, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: possibl increas one chanc friend appli desir good well win process would forc everyon mold without take consider diverg individu need
TEXT:  Furthermore, all three methods would probably lead to the emergence of a black market, via which people who have received one of the scarce commodities would sell it on to those who received nothing. Even if there is officially no money, a suitable reward or return gift would no doubt be found, leading to barter trade, or one of the scarce goods would take on the role of a black-market currency., LINE: 2113, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: furthermor three method would probabl lead emerg black market via peopl receiv one scarc commod would sell receiv noth even offici money suitabl reward return gift would doubt found lead barter trade one scarc good would take role black market currenc
TEXT:  Even if such black-market transactions were illegal, it would not be possible to prevent them altogether in a non-totalitarian society. Algorithmic rationing, as conceived by Stefan Heidenreich,5 would not necessarily be any better., LINE: 2114, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: even black market transact illeg would possibl prevent altogeth non totalitarian societi algorithm would necessarili better
TEXT:  Heidenreich’s proposal involves “intelligent” computer programs, which decide who receives what goods. Unlike the above-mentioned methods, not everyone is treated the same; instead different people have individually differing entitlements to goods., LINE: 2115, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: propos intellig comput program decid good unlik method everyon instead differ peopl individu entitl good
TEXT:  On the one hand this allows different needs to be assessed better than in the case of a strict rationing system. On the other hand, people would be giving up control of major aspects of their lives to computers., LINE: 2116, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: one hand differ need assess better case strict system hand peopl would give control major aspect life comput
TEXT:  Even if Heidenreich stresses that the algorithms used must be the result of democratic debates, the individual loss of sovereignty would nonetheless be scary. Furthermore, the distribution algorithms in such a society would have power which even dictators could only dream of., LINE: 2117, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: even stress algorithm use must result democrat debat individu loss sovereignti would nonetheless scari furthermor distribut algorithm societi would power even dictat could dream
TEXT:  This raises the question of who will control the programmers who create these algorithms, or (in the case of self-learning algorithms) at least their basic framework, and how hackers can be prevented from manipulating the algorithms to their own advantage., LINE: 2118, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: rais question control programm creat algorithm case self learn algorithm least basic framework hacker algorithm advantag
TEXT:  Moreover, self-learning algorithms are generally a “black box”: even their programmers cannot reconstruct in detail why an algorithm has made a particular decision. If the decisions of the algorithms were to lead to suffering or obvious injustices, it would therefore be difficult to intervene and correct them., LINE: 2119, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: moreov self learn algorithm gener black box even programm cannot reconstruct detail algorithm ha made particular decis decis algorithm lead suffer obviou injustic would therefor difficult interven correct
TEXT:  This short critical overview of money-free distribution methods shows that the supposed cure is not necessarily better than the disease. Of course markets and prices have serious disadvantages, in their capitalist version in any case., LINE: 2120, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: short critic overview money free distribut method show suppos cure necessarili better diseas cours market price seriou disadvantag capitalist version case
TEXT:  But the same goes for the attempts to do without them, and besides, the market would probably creep back in surreptitiously. These disadvantages could only be avoided in a genuinely affluent society, in which there was enough of every good to satisfy all demands, even if it was given away at a price of zero., LINE: 2121, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: go attempt without besid market would probabl creep back surreptiti disadvantag could genuin affluent societi wa enough everi good satisfi demand even wa given away price zero
TEXT:  But as stated above, a universally affluent society is not a realistic prospect for the foreseeable future, at least as long as humanity remains on earth, with its finite resources. So perhaps a price system is not a bad idea, at least for some of the goods that are not available in abundance? Certainly not for all goods: for some things, such as comprehensive medical care, distribution according to socially defined need makes more sense., LINE: 2122, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: state univers affluent societi realist prospect forese futur least long human remain earth finit resourc perhap price system bad idea least good avail abund certainli good thing comprehens medic care distribut accord social defin need make sens
TEXT:  And other methods such as FCFS, distribution by lot, and rationing may occasionally be justified. But since all of these methods have their disadvantages, a social debate about this is needed. There is no generally “right” answer, and in some cases a majority of people would probably, with good reason, favor the use of a price system for the distribution of goods., LINE: 2123, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: method distribut lot may occasion sinc method disadvantag social debat gener right answer case major peopl would probabl good reason favor use price system distribut good
TEXT:  3. Moneyless Production I understand production in a broad sense, as in Dalton’s definition (1971: 25), encompassing the provision of necessary and desired activities and goods. In this sense, cooking food at home or putting the children to bed is also production, just as much as installing software on a computer or manufacturing the computer., LINE: 2124, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: moneyless product understand product broad sens dalton definit provis necessari desir activ good sens cook food home child bed also product much comput comput

TEXT:  Today production for (extended) personal use is usually unpaid, and that for general others is usually paid, but this is not always the case.

TEXT: 6 From a historical perspective, this mode of production was dominant in subsistence-oriented economies: subsistence production is production in fairly small groups for collective personal use, which can certainly be understood as production for (extended) personal use, since the group ensures that there are at least loose relationships between all of its members., LINE: 2131, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: histor perspect mode product wa domin subsist economi subsist product product fairli small group collect person use certainli understood product extend person use sinc group least loos relationship member
TEXT:  3.1 The Dunbar Limit Of course this is the limitation of subsistence production, as mentioned above: since it is based on personal relationships, it mainly works on a small scale. I will refer to this as the “Dunbar limit,” after the “Dunbar number” identified by the anthropologist Robin Dunbar, which indicates the number of people with whom someone can maintain personal relationships., LINE: 2132, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: limit cours limit subsist product sinc base person relationship mainli work small scale refer limit number anthropologist robin number peopl someon maintain person relationship
TEXT:  Typically, the Dunbar number is stated to be “around 150,” though it can vary individually between around 100 and 250. Groups that are strongly oriented toward subsistence and production for collective personal use, and which dispense with forms of mediation such as money or distinct social hierarchies, almost never exceed the Dunbar number., LINE: 2133, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: typic number state around though vari individu around group strongli toward subsist product collect person use dispens form mediat money distinct social hierarchi almost never exceed number

TEXT:  Those among the community-supported agriculture (CSA) projects that spread costs among groups of subscribers in a solidarity-based, self-organized way (instead of charging everyone the same amount), rarely have more than 150 shares (a share can belong to more than one person, for example a family, but this does not have any direct impact on the structure of the project)., LINE: 2135, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: among commun agricultur project spread cost among group subscrib solidar base self organ way instead charg everyon amount rare share share belong one person exampl famili doe direct impact structur project

TEXT:  In my opinion this is no coincidence.

TEXT:  But such larger contexts beyond the Dunbar limit are likely to remain essential for the organization of production processes. 3.2 Central Planning?

TEXT:  Central does not necessarily mean the whole world or a whole country, but it does mean that there is a production plan for society as a whole in a particular geographical area, a plan that makes binding provisions for all the inhabitants of this area and their rights (to take and use goods) and obligations (to contribute)., LINE: 2140, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: central doe necessarili mean whole world whole countri doe mean product plan societi whole particular geograph area plan make bind provis inhabit area right take use good oblig contribut
TEXT:  Such a production plan could certainly be created democratically.

TEXT:  Ancient Roman law distinguished between three kinds of contract (or, in more general terms, agreement): 1.do ut des: I give so that you may give, e.g. sales contracts, tenancy agreements or loans (one party gives a certain amount of money, the other later pays back a larger amount)., LINE: 2153, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: ancient law distinguish three kind contract gener term agreement de give may give sale contract tenanc agreement loan one parti give certain amount money later pay back amount

The most radical proponents of a money-free world assume that every form of explicitly or implicitly expected reciprocity will vanish along with money.10 But even if implicitly expected reciprocity and money-free forms of explicitly agreed reciprocity continue to be seen as legitimate, I still have doubts as to whether asymmetrical agreements based on “I give so that you may give/may do” could be completely replaced if they disappeared., LINE: 2166, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: greater flexibl radic propon money free world assum everi form explicitli implicitli reciproc vanish along money even implicitli reciproc money free form explicitli agre reciproc continu seen legitim still doubt whether asymmetr agreement base give may give may could complet

Here the Dunbar limit once again comes into play: a few dozen parties may be able to reach individual agreements about who will take on what tasks, but when hundreds or thousands of people are involved this becomes impossible., LINE: 2168, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: principl highli divis task conceiv consider effort sinc involv must accept differenti fair limit come play dozen parti may abl reach individu agreement take task hundr thousand peopl involv becom imposs

TEXT:  And as a rule only very few kinds of products are distributed via a commons system—perhaps access to water, locally grown vegetables, or firewood.

TEXT:  Some people like to travel a lot; some regularly drink cocktails or fine whiskey; some have pets that need to be provided for; many people eat meat, while others reject the consumption of meat or even that of any animal products as unethical; different people have completely different hobbies, and usually need various products to pursue these., LINE: 2171, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: peopl like travel lot regularli drink cocktail fine whiskey pet need provid mani peopl eat meat reject consumpt meat even anim product uneth differ peopl complet differ hobbi usual need variou product pursu
TEXT:  How could the same commons system satisfy all these different needs? There is only one answer to this: not at all. The number of “flows,” and of contributions and participants required to produce these, would be much too large for all participants to agree on a uniform set of rules for the distribution of “flows” and duties., LINE: 2172, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: could common system satisfi differ need one answer number flow contribut particip produc would much larg particip agre uniform set rule distribut flow duti
TEXT:  In order to satisfy such diverse needs in accordance with commons principles, people would therefore have to participate not in one but in a whole series of different commons systems—and thus also make the relevant contributions for each of them., LINE: 2173, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: order satisfi divers need accord common principl peopl would therefor particip one whole seri differ common system thu also make relev contribut
TEXT:  This, however, would probably lead to a highly fragmented life structure, involving constant switching between different activities in very different contexts.

TEXT:  Some tasks cannot be dealt with in this way at all: a health commons, dispensing with specialist doctors and nurses and dividing all tasks equally among its members, would probably have a detrimental effect on their health., LINE: 2175, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: task cannot dealt way health common specialist doctor nurs divid task equal among member would probabl detriment effect health
TEXT:  But employing professionals, who are paid and can therefore devote themselves to a single thing instead of having to participate in dozens of other commons systems, would contradict the paradigm of money-free production., LINE: 2176, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: profession therefor devot singl thing instead particip dozen common system would contradict paradigm money free product
TEXT:  A similar solution would be for different commons systems to agree to mutually recognize contributions to any one of them, as I proposed in From Exchange to Contributions (Siefkes 2008). This would not necessarily require money, but it would necessitate some unit of compensation very similar to money, which would make it possible to reduce contributions to a “common denominator” and make them comparable., LINE: 2177, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: similar solut would differ common system agre mutual recogn contribut one exchang contribut would necessarili requir money would necessit unit compens similar money would make possibl reduc contribut common denomin make compar
TEXT:  3.5 Renouncing Compensation and Implicit Planned Economy But perhaps it would be possible to forego every kind of compensation, instead of continuing to use money or something very similar? Perhaps the doctor could devote herself to the health of others, while trusting that others will make sure she has enough to eat and a nice place to live, that her pets are also well fed, and that she can have an extended holiday twice a year? This would mean, among other things, the disappearance of any explicitly agreed reciprocity., LINE: 2178, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: compens implicit economi perhap would possibl forego everi kind compens instead use money someth similar perhap doctor could devot health trust make sure ha enough eat nice place live pet also well fed extend holiday twice year would mean among thing disappear explicitli agre reciproc
TEXT:  What is clear here is that explicit agreements could not be replaced by the implicit expectation of reciprocity on an individual basis, as is normal for presents and favors. Modern production processes are too complex for this: it is not only the doctor who contributes to a patient’s treatment and recovery in a hospital, but also nurses and numerous other employees, who keep the hospital running, and all those who provide the necessary equipment, drugs, energy, water, etc., LINE: 2179, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: clear explicit agreement could implicit expect reciproc individu basi normal present favor modern product process complex doctor patient treatment recoveri hospit also nurs numer employe keep hospit run provid necessari equip drug energi water
TEXT:  When mediation is money-based, previously signed contracts ensure that all participants are paid, though often (as a critical aside) in a very unbalanced way. It is not necessarily the patient herself who pays; it may instead be a health insurance fund or the state, funding a health system which is free for users., LINE: 2180, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: mediat money base previous contract ensur particip though often critic asid unbalanc way necessarili patient pay may instead health insur fund state health system free user
TEXT:  It would quite obviously be impossible—and utterly overwhelming—if the patient were implicitly expected to give appropriate return gifts to all the involved parties. At most, then, it is possible to imagine an expectation of reciprocity on a general social level (others do something for me, I do something for others, though generally not the same others), or alternatively, the renunciation of all expectations of reciprocity., LINE: 2181, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: would quit obvious imposs utterli overwhelm patient implicitli give appropri return gift involv parti possibl imagin expect reciproc gener social level someth someth though gener altern renunci expect reciproc
TEXT:  In the latter case, people would only become active if they felt like doing something, or if they considered a task sufficiently useful and important. From the point of view of producers, both these options sound good: they involve doing something for others, but deciding autonomously what and how., LINE: 2182, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: latter case peopl would becom activ felt like someth consid task suffici use import point view produc option sound good involv someth autonom
TEXT:  From the point of view of consumers, however, the complete renunciation of reciprocity creates problems, since this minimizes their influence on producers.

TEXT:  If the terms do not suit me, I will perhaps find another provider who offers me better ones, or I can renegotiate and, for example, increase my own offer in the hope of better terms.

TEXT: ” They can express wishes, but what the producers do with the (probably very numerous) wishes is entirely up to them. This problem may seem less serious if we fall into the trap which I call implicit planned economy: the idea that it is actually already obvious what needs to be done in society as a whole, and that all we have to do is find, for each task, someone who will actually do it., LINE: 2185, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: express wish produc probabl numer wish entir problem may seem less seriou fall trap call implicit economi idea actual alreadi obviou need done societi whole find task someon actual
TEXT:  Stefan Meretz12 falls into this trap, for example, when he writes: “From a systemic perspective, it is irrelevant who makes the necessary contributions, as long as it is assured, on average, that it securely takes place., LINE: 2186, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: fall trap exampl system perspect irrelev make necessari contribut long assur averag secur take place
TEXT: ” In fact, very little is “necessary” in complex societies. Strictly speaking it is not even “necessary” for everyone to become as old as possible, though this is undoubtedly desirable; and there is virtually nothing necessary about the way people spend their days., LINE: 2187, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: fact littl necessari complex societi strictli speak even necessari everyon becom old possibl though undoubtedli desir virtual noth necessari way peopl spend day
TEXT:  In money-based mediation, people decide for themselves what is desirable for them, not only as producers, but also as consumers and users. Someone who has a limited monthly budget can at least decide for herself how to spend it, beyond the “bare necessities., LINE: 2188, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: money base mediat peopl decid desir produc also consum user someon ha limit monthli budget least decid spend beyond bare necess
TEXT: ” This individualization of decision-making options can be criticized, e.g. when parents have to pay for their children, and therefore, in comparison to people without children, have to do without certain things., LINE: 2189, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: decis make option parent pay child therefor comparison peopl without child without certain thing
TEXT:  But such injustices are linked with the actual distribution of money, not with the fact that it is used at all. When money is used as a “flexible means of rationing,” people decide for themselves what they see as necessary or desirable., LINE: 2190, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: injustic link actual distribut money fact use money use flexibl mean peopl decid see necessari desir
TEXT:  Decision-making is decentralized, and lies with the different consumers or users themselves. In my view it can certainly be argued that this is better than leaving it in the hands of the producers or a central authority., LINE: 2191, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: decis make lie differ consum user view certainli better leav hand produc central author
TEXT:  Producers can survey people’s wishes, but they cannot know how important people’s different wishes are to them. If, on the other hand, I have my own budget, I can decide what I will allow myself to have immediately, what I will postpone having (and perhaps save up for), and what I can do without altogether., LINE: 2192, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: produc survey peopl wish cannot know import peopl differ wish hand budget decid allow immedi postpon perhap save without altogeth
TEXT:  3.6 Stigmergy and Self-Selected Teams A concept occasionally mentioned as an instrument of mediation to convert decentralized wish lists into useful products is “stigmergy.”13 In brief, stigmergy means that people leave suggestions or cues about what could or (from their point of view) should be done, and other people, to whom a certain suggestion makes sense, and who see themselves as having the relevant skills, then implement this suggestion—without anyone forcing them or paying them to do so., LINE: 2193, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: self select team concept occasion instrument mediat convert wish list use product brief mean peopl leav suggest cue could point view done peopl certain suggest make sens see relev skill implement suggest without anyon forc pay
TEXT:  Probably the biggest and most impressive example of stigmergy is Wikipedia. Never could the makers of traditional encyclopedias such as the Encyclopedia Britannica have dreamt that a group of unpaid amateurs would destroy their business model! Yet the remarkable success of this stigmergic self-organization depends on very specific conditions, which cannot be created for most production projects., LINE: 2194, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: probabl biggest impress exampl never could maker tradit encyclopedia encyclopedia dreamt group unpaid amateur would destroy busi model yet remark success self organ specif condit cannot product project
TEXT:  The secret of Wikipedia’s success is that all the countless suggestions for possible improvements and expansions can be dealt with separately. Whether I am correcting a spelling mistake in an article, searching for and adding missing sources, rewriting badly written or non-neutral paragraphs, or starting completely new articles, I can do so at any time, without being reliant on any specific preliminary work by others., LINE: 2195, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: secret success countless suggest possibl improv expans dealt separ whether correct spell mistak articl search miss sourc badli written non neutral paragraph start complet new articl time without reliant specif preliminari work
TEXT:  Every possible change is “atomic”; it has no other prerequisites than the existence and availability of Wikipedia itself. For most material production processes, the situation is quite different: here a whole series of preparatory steps are usually necessary., LINE: 2196, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: everi possibl chang atom ha prerequisit exist avail materi product process situat quit differ whole seri preparatori step usual necessari
TEXT:  In order to assemble any material thing—be it a bicycle, a Wi-Fi router or a sofa bed—all the necessary parts must first be present; all the necessary tools and resources must also be present, and a suitable workshop or manufacturing environment must be available., LINE: 2197, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: order assembl materi thing bicycl router sofa bed necessari part must first present necessari tool resourc must also present suitabl workshop environ must avail
TEXT:  If even just one of the dozens or hundreds of elements needed is missing, then the production process cannot begin, or will fail. Conversely, it makes little sense to produce individual components and precursor products without knowing whether they will be used anywhere., LINE: 2198, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: even one dozen hundr element miss product process cannot begin fail convers make littl sens produc individu compon precursor product without know whether use anywher
TEXT:  It becomes even more difficult if the good or its precursor products do not have a long shelf-life, or if living creatures play a part in the production process. In the vast majority of material production processes, then, the “atomicity” of the necessary tasks is not given: most tasks are dependent on various other tasks, which must be carried out shortly before, shortly after, or in parallel., LINE: 2199, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: becom even difficult good precursor product long shelf life live creatur play part product process vast major materi product process atom necessari task given task depend variou task must carri shortli shortli parallel
TEXT:  A further key factor in the success of stigmergic self-organization is that no lasting damage is done if individual tasks are completed badly or incorrectly. In Wikipedia, inappropriate or malicious changes can quickly be reversed by others., LINE: 2200, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: key factor success self organ last damag done individu task badli incorrectli inappropri malici chang quickli revers
TEXT:  Similarly, free (or open source) software often involves stigmergic changes carried out by all those who feel called to develop the software. But there is always a core team or maintainer who has the last word and reviews all the proposed changes before incorporating them into the software (or not, as the case may be)., LINE: 2201, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: similarli free open sourc often chang carri feel develop alway core team maintain ha last word review chang case may
TEXT:  This means that users only have to trust the core team or maintainer, but not the potentially large number of other people who have contributed to the development in one way or another. In general, it is a characteristic of successful stigmergic projects that contributions can be made first; it is only afterwards that they are checked to see whether they are harmless and can be included long-term., LINE: 2202, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: mean user trust core team maintain potenti larg number peopl develop one way anoth gener characterist success project contribut made first afterward check see whether harmless includ long term
TEXT:  Many activities have an immediate effect, however, and their consequences can no longer be undone. Few patients are likely to put their trust in a hospital whose nurses and operating teams work on the principle of “There’s work to be done here: any volunteers?” The harm that they could do, due to inexperience, carelessness or malice, is simply too great., LINE: 2203, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: mani activ immedi effect howev consequ longer undon patient like put trust hospit whose nurs oper team work principl work done volunt harm could due inexperi careless malic simpli great
TEXT:  There are alternatives to stigmergy, which leave behind some of its limitations and are nonetheless based on the voluntary, non-contractual “self-selection” of participants. Voluntary teams can come together and take care of certain operations on a voluntary or honorary basis, be they hospitals, farms, or software programs., LINE: 2204, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: altern leav behind limit nonetheless base voluntari non contractu self select particip voluntari team come togeth take care certain oper voluntari honorari basi hospit farm program
TEXT:  The above-mentioned “core teams” of many free software projects function on the basis of this principle (though admittedly they are not always unpaid). The potential users can develop trust in such teams, and can test their competencies, and such teams can also implement larger projects, which cannot be subdivided into numerous atomic individual tasks., LINE: 2205, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: core team mani free project function basi principl though admittedli alway unpaid potenti user develop trust team test compet team also implement project cannot numer atom individu task
TEXT:  Nonetheless, even teams such as these show the disadvantage of “one-sided” self-selection, which is not based on explicitly agreed reciprocity: the active members decide as they see fit what they will deal with, and what priorities they will set themselves; users who do not become active themselves can only express their wishes in a non-binding way., LINE: 2206, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: nonetheless even team show disadvantag one side self select base explicitli agre reciproc activ member decid see fit deal prioriti set user becom activ express wish non bind way
TEXT:  In the case of free software, this is shown by the fact that it is often written by programmers for programmers. Free programs are excellent when it comes to any kind of tool for the programming and management of computers and networks, where they often leave their proprietary (non-free) alternatives far behind., LINE: 2207, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: case free shown fact often written programm programm free program excel come kind tool manag comput network often leav proprietari non free altern far behind
TEXT:  There are also free variants of other kinds of software—office programs, graphics and video editing, games etc.—but these often lag behind their proprietary equivalents to a greater or lesser extent. Often the user-friendliness of free software also leaves something to be desired from the point of view of non-programmers., LINE: 2208, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: also free variant kind offic program graphic video game often lag behind proprietari equival greater lesser extent often user friendli free also leaf someth desir point view non programm
TEXT:  To some extent these differences are due to the fact that proprietary software companies have huge development teams, and small teams of volunteers cannot compete with their work. But of course these huge teams do not come out of nowhere: they consist of programmers who would probably, for the most part, not be sufficiently motivated to work on the software for many years voluntarily and without pay; the salary paid to them (which is ultimately funded by the users) provides the necessary motivation., LINE: 2209, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: extent differ due fact proprietari compani huge develop team small team volunt cannot compet work cours huge team come nowher consist programm would probabl part suffici work mani year voluntarili without pay salari ultim fund user necessari motiv
TEXT:  And in order to survive on the market, companies must take the needs and wishes of their (potential) users very seriously, and design their products on this basis. “The customer is always right” or “the customer is king” is a slogan, but it contains a substantial kernel of truth., LINE: 2210, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: order surviv market compani must take need wish potenti user serious design product basi custom alway right custom king slogan substanti kernel truth
TEXT:  The users are considerably less important for teams of unpaid volunteers. Of course it feels good if the software is used and appreciated by a large number of people, and some users will probably become active contributors sooner or later, thus ensuring that the project continues., LINE: 2211, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: user consider less import team unpaid volunt cours feel good use larg number peopl user probabl becom activ contributor sooner later thu project
TEXT:  But this again leads to a certain “self-similarity” between the active programmers and their “favorite users”: anyone who cannot program or contribute in another way is less interesting. Also relevant for material products and services (activities) are the distribution issues mentioned above., LINE: 2212, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: lead certain self similar activ programm favorit user anyon cannot program contribut anoth way less interest also relev materi product servic activ distribut issu
TEXT:  A software project can offer the current version of the developed software to everyone who wants to download it.

TEXT:  4. Money and Explicitly Agreed Reciprocity Cannot Easily Be Rendered Superfluous Overall, it can be said that there are many arguments against money, and especially against its “autonomization” in capitalism, and the way it dominates all other relationships as a compulsion or drive to maximize profit., LINE: 2214, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: money explicitli agre reciproc cannot easili superflu overal said mani argument money especi capit way relationship compuls drive maxim profit
TEXT:  At the same time, however, a look back in history shows that this autonomization of the profit principle is much more recent than the use of money, and that it is by no means an inevitable consequence of using money., LINE: 2215, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: time howev look back histori show profit principl much recent use money mean inevit consequ money
TEXT:  Most notably, no systematic tendency towards profit maximization can be observed in places where there are markets but no market principle—where products are traded, but not land or labor. Moreover, the analysis shows that explicitly agreed reciprocity along the lines of “I give so that you may give/do” is an option for human interaction which can hardly be replaced completely and without losses by other options, at least in “large-scale” contexts that exceed the Dunbar limit., LINE: 2216, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: notabl systemat tendenc toward profit maxim place market market principl product land labor moreov analysi show explicitli agre reciproc along line give may give option human interact hardli complet without loss option least larg scale context exceed limit
TEXT:  Without the use of money or a similar unit of compensation, however, this kind of mutual agreement is seldom likely to be practicable.

TEXT:  This task is much bigger than just finding a “substitute” for money as means of mediation—indeed, this view reproduces the predominant neoclassical economic theory’s assumption of the “neutrality of money” or of the “monetary veil” that lies over all real transactions (Romer 2012; cf., LINE: 2236, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: task much bigger find substitut money mean mediat inde view predomin econom theori assumpt neutral money monetari veil lie real transact

TEXT:  Accordingly, what has to be explained is why a social process of reproduction—the process for creating and maintaining all conditions of life—gets split into “real” and “monetary” processes at all and why its moments then also gain independence vis-à-vis one another, even though they are only what they are in their unity and can also only be grasped in this way., LINE: 2238, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: accordingli ha social process reproduct process condit life get split real monetari process moment also gain independ one anoth even though uniti also way
TEXT:  It is only on this basis that we can first develop the question of whether and how it is possible to depict a total social system of reproduction that does not give rise to the dichotomization of the real, because social mediation takes place in a qualitatively different fashion., LINE: 2239, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: basi first develop question whether possibl depict total social system reproduct doe give rise dichotom real social mediat take place qualit differ fashion

TEXT:  Thus, for instance, “communism” is this sort of image, which has been shaped by way of historical experiences with formerly really-existing socialism. Image prohibition attempts to circumvent this problematic, inasmuch as it is assumed that such images of a future condition cannot go beyond what already exists and hence are to be avoided., LINE: 2242, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: thu instanc commun sort imag ha shape way histor experi formerli realli social imag prohibit attempt circumv problemat inasmuch assum imag futur condit cannot beyond alreadi henc
TEXT:  The categorial approach attempts to avoid this opposition by indeed repudiating images on the level of experiences and conceptions, but still trying to develop the basic outlines of a different form of social organization by elaborating the conceptual foundations of a post-monetary society on an intermediate theoretical level., LINE: 2243, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: categori approach attempt avoid opposit inde imag level experi concept still tri develop basic outlin differ form social organ conceptu foundat post monetari societi intermedi theoret level
TEXT:  Since these considerations are always made explicit, they are also always susceptible to criticism.

TEXT:  Thus, capitalism is undeniably a human society; but, with the monetary mediation that is proper to it, it does not necessarily represent an, as it were, “natural-ideal” form of social organization.

TEXT:  Mediation The concept of mediation has hitherto been used without explanation. We want now to provide a more precise definition, since the concept is key for the argument to follow. Mediation is used here in a dual sense., LINE: 2248, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: mediat concept mediat ha hitherto use without explan want provid precis definit sinc concept key argument follow mediat use dual sens
TEXT:  On the one hand, it is a matter of the mediation of individuals in and with society.

TEXT:  On the other hand, it is a matter of the mediation of society with itself. From a systemic point of view, every society has a tendency toward self-preservation. It uses the reproductive contributions of its members to preserve and renew itself., LINE: 2250, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: hand matter mediat societi system point view everi societi ha tendenc toward self preserv us reproduct contribut member preserv renew
TEXT:  It makes no difference who concretely makes these contributions; they have simply to be made by someone.

TEXT:  Hence, it is a matter of two different perspectives on the same set of interrelationships. The two moments of mediation interpenetrate and form a whole. Nonetheless, the differences have to be clearly seen., LINE: 2252, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: henc matter two differ perspect set two moment mediat interpenetr form whole nonetheless differ clearli seen
TEXT:  What appears from the point of view of society as transpersonal necessities, are for individuals merely (inter-)personal action possibilities.2 If purposes and modes of functioning are inscribed into the societal infrastructures and hence have objective character, then these purposes on the level of necessities can come into conflict with subjective needs on the level of possibilities., LINE: 2253, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: point view societi transperson necess individu mere inter person action possibl purpos mode societ infrastructur henc object charact purpos level necess come conflict subject need level possibl

TEXT:  This leads, in turn, to the question of in what way the individual action level (of possibilities) is mediated by the social level (of necessities): or, in other words, how the connection between elementary actions on the micro level and the totality of all actions on the macro level is produced., LINE: 2255, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: lead turn question way individu action level possibl social level necess word connect elementari action micro level total action macro level produc
TEXT: 3 Social Obligation In addition to its function of mediation, money also has the possibility of delineating social obligations between actors (in the form of debt) and making them interoperable (payment redeems debt/s)—if necessary, with the support of threatened sanctions., LINE: 2256, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: social oblig addit function mediat money also ha possibl social oblig actor form debt make payment debt necessari support sanction
TEXT:  Even if the dual mediation depicted above could take place in a post-capitalist and hence a post-monetary society (which has still to be shown), the question remains whether social obligations—hence, non-monetary relations of debt—will, then, become obsolete or if they possess a supra-historical character and hence will look for other forms of expression., LINE: 2257, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: even dual mediat could take place post capitalist henc post monetari societi ha still shown question remain whether social oblig henc non monetari relat debt becom obsolet possess histor charact henc look form express
TEXT:  In order to provide an answer, we need to define the concept of social obligation more precisely. Social obligations are subjective or objective expectations of or claims on individuals, collectives or society as a whole., LINE: 2258, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: order provid answer need defin concept social oblig precis social oblig subject object expect claim individu collect societi whole

They do not arise when contributions and utilizations occur unconditionally., LINE: 2259, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: aris form reciproc contribut give util take condit link one anoth way expect claim aris contribut util occur uncondit
TEXT: 4 The question for a post-monetary society is hence whether and for what domains (inter-individual, collective, societal) such unconditional reciprocity relations can be adopted. Capitalism The conceptual reflections that we have undertaken thus far have largely been general in nature; they have thus abstracted from the fact that we are today dealing with capitalist relations., LINE: 2260, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: question post monetari societi henc whether domain inter individu collect societ uncondit reciproc relat adopt capit conceptu reflect thu far larg gener natur thu abstract fact today deal capitalist relat
TEXT:  This fact has now to be taken into account. Elementary Form: Commodity The dual mediation depicted above is also reflected in individual reproductive actions. These have to be doubly functional: hence, at the same time, to secure one’s own existence and to reproduce the systemic context in which the actions possess their functionality., LINE: 2261, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: fact ha taken account elementari form commod dual mediat also reflect individu reproduct action doubli function henc time secur one exist reproduc system context action possess function
TEXT:  The basic social mode of action in capitalism is (participation in) the production of commodities for sale and their transformation in money (as a profit or wage) for the purpose of purchasing commodities required for preserving one’s existence., LINE: 2262, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: basic social mode action capit particip product commod sale transform money profit wage purpos commod one exist
TEXT:  The commodity is thus the elementary form (cf. Marx 1976: 125) that generates the totality of the system of capitalism and, at the same time, is generated by the latter and only within it possesses the function of elementary form (cf., LINE: 2263, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: commod thu elementari form total system capit time latter within function elementari form
TEXT:  footnote 3). On this understanding, the commodity is not a neutral thing, but rather a social form, in which special “things” and “services”—products for sale—are produced. Their social form, the manner and purpose of their production, is inscribed in commodities., LINE: 2264, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: footnot understand commod neutral thing rather social form special thing servic product sale produc social form manner purpos product commod
TEXT: 5 In all societies, production is—to a varying extent—production for general others. The particularity of capitalism is the production for others on the basis of private property. Private production by entities that are separate from one another requires after-the-fact (“ex post”) that there be exchange for the purpose of mediating between producers of goods and those who need them (and have the money to buy them)., LINE: 2265, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: societi product extent product gener particular capit product basi privat properti privat product entiti separ one anoth fact post exchang purpos mediat produc good need money buy
TEXT:  The market is the generalized instance of this ex post mediation.6 The universality of market mediation leads, in turn, to a number of far-reaching consequences. Some of the aspects that are relevant to the context of the current presentation will be discussed here: duplication, equivalence, competition, inversion, valorization, externalization, and logic of exclusion., LINE: 2266, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: market gener instanc post mediat univers market mediat lead turn number far reach consequ aspect relev context current present duplic equival competit invers valor extern logic exclus
TEXT:  Duplication The commodity “duplicates” itself, because its two moments of usefulness and mediation develop in opposition to one another.7 The commodity is physically useful for those who want to obtain it, in order to satisfy needs: in other words, for the buyer, but not for the seller., LINE: 2267, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: duplic commod duplic two moment use mediat develop opposit one anoth commod physic use want obtain order satisfi need word buyer seller
TEXT:  The latter is instead interested in successful exchange: sale. In developed capitalism, the commodity indirectly establishes a relation with all other commodities in exchange: or, more precisely, with the outlay required for their production., LINE: 2268, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: latter instead interest success exchang sale capit commod indirectli relat commod exchang precis outlay product
TEXT: 8 A societal relation with all productive outlay is thereby formed. This relation is value. The value of a commodity reflects the relation of the outlay required for its production with respect to all other commodities, but it cannot itself be specified as an absolute quantity., LINE: 2269, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: societ relat product outlay therebi form relat valu valu commod relat outlay product respect commod cannot absolut quantiti
TEXT:  In order to be quantitatively operational, value must be depicted in a fixed objective or symbolic entity. This entity exists in the form of money. Money exchanges against all commodities and hence is in a position to represent value relations in the universe of commodities by reference to itself., LINE: 2270, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: order quantit oper valu must fix object symbol entiti entiti form money money exchang commod henc posit repres valu relat univers commod refer
TEXT:  Money is the general commodity, and therefore general equivalent, and discharges the function of expressing value quantities. Thanks to the value expressed by means of its relation to money, the dual-commodity can enter into societal mediation., LINE: 2271, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: money gener commod therefor gener equival discharg function valu quantiti thank valu express mean relat money dual commod enter societ mediat
TEXT:  Colloquially expressed: The commodity has a price that has to be paid to obtain it—and, ultimately, to use it. Although the satisfaction of needs provides the original impetus for production, value has priority., LINE: 2272, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: colloqui express commod ha price ha obtain ultim use although satisfact need origin impetu product valu ha prioriti
TEXT:  Equivalence The generality of value comparisons, cutting across all differences in individual acts of exchange, provides for equivalence. On average, consequently, equal values always exchange: hence equal societal production outlays., LINE: 2273, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: equival gener valu comparison cut across differ individu act exchang equival averag consequ equal valu alway exchang henc equal societ product outlay
TEXT:  It is important here that usefulness is irrelevant for mediation. Only the property of representing value—as expressed in money—is taken into account for the mediation. Considered in isolation, however, the value property is entirely immaterial and is not suitable to satisfying needs., LINE: 2274, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: import use irrelev mediat properti valu express money taken account mediat consid isol howev valu properti entir immateri suitabl satisfi need
TEXT:  In the opposition between usefulness and mediation, mediation plays the determining role. This means that commodities have first to pass through the mediation, i.e. they must be sold and bought, before they can satisfy a need., LINE: 2275, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: opposit use mediat mediat play role mean commod first mediat must sold bought satisfi need
TEXT:  Whoever, for instance, due to lack of money, is unable to participate in the process of mediation, is excluded from the social organization’s objective mode of provision. Or expressed in everyday language: “Money talks, bullshit walks., LINE: 2276, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: whoever instanc due lack money unabl particip process mediat social organ object mode provis express everyday languag money talk walk
TEXT: ” Competition The moment of the mediation of commodities does not only force commodities into a universal relation of comparison and mediation, but also their producers, who produce privately and separately from one another., LINE: 2277, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: competit moment mediat commod doe forc commod univers relat comparison mediat also produc produc privat separ one anoth
TEXT:  Despite its private character, production is always also simultaneously societal, since it has to be directed toward achieving the societally requisite outlay for the production of commodities or producing for less., LINE: 2278, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: despit privat charact product alway also simultan societ sinc ha direct toward societ requisit outlay product commod less
TEXT:  Since all producers (must) do this, but the market is limited, the social relationship into which private producers are forced is that of competition.9 Inversion Active producers can always freely decide about their production, but the standard by which their action has to be oriented is given: It is sellability or, in other words, the compulsion to produce commodities at their societally current value or preferably below it., LINE: 2279, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: sinc produc must market limit social relationship privat produc forc competit invers activ produc alway freeli decid product standard action ha given word compuls produc commod societ current valu prefer
TEXT:  An unintended, but unavoidable inversion of the objective and the social arises: Social relations appear as properties of relations among things. Producers organize their social relationships in accordance with the objectively necessary properties that commodities must have, in order to be sellable., LINE: 2280, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: unintend unavoid invers object social social relat appear properti relat among thing produc organ social relationship accord object necessari properti commod must order sellabl
TEXT:  The commodities tell the producers what is to be done. Marx called this the “fetishism which attaches itself to the products of labor as soon as they are produced as commodities, and is therefore inseparable from the production of commodities” (Marx 1976: 165)., LINE: 2281, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: commod tell produc done fetish attach product labor soon produc commod therefor insepar product commod
TEXT:  This fetishism is not mere appearance, but rather real objective compulsion, to which producers in competition must yield, in order to remain in business. This objective compulsion takes many different shapes and pervades all social domains: whether it be as compulsion to grow, compulsion to save, externalization compulsion, etc., LINE: 2282, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: fetish mere appear rather real object compuls produc competit must yield order remain busi object compuls take mani differ shape social domain whether compuls grow compuls save extern compuls
TEXT:  An ineluctable logic of things10 determines what can be socially organized and how—and what cannot be.11 Put pointedly: Instead of a conscious social movement of things for sensory-concrete purposes (needs), what arises is an unconscious objectively driven movement of the social for alien abstract aims (increasing money)., LINE: 2283, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: ineluct logic thing social organ cannot put pointedli instead consciou social movement thing sensori concret purpos need unconsci object driven movement social alien abstract aim increas money
TEXT:  In this process, money as objective-quantitative value relation is the means of (individual or collective) assignment of social obligations (“debts”). Money decides, and it has no morals.12 Valorization Competition and inversion, as well as the primacy of mediation, lead to a compulsion to valorize in production., LINE: 2284, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: process money object quantit valu relat mean individu collect assign social oblig debt money ha moral valor competit invers well primaci mediat lead compuls valor product
TEXT:  This means that production is undertaken primarily to increase the capital employed. Money must beget more money. Inasmuch as it is valorized, money thus relates to itself. The production of useful goods is merely a means for fulfilling the primary objective of valorizing money., LINE: 2285, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: mean product primarili increas capit employ money must beget money inasmuch money thu product use good mere mean primari object money
TEXT:  On the level of money or, respectively, of capital, we also find that capital appears as an active power and its possessors only as agents executing a given purpose that is alien to them. The positions of object and subject get inverted: Capital becomes, as Karl Marx put it, an “automatic subject., LINE: 2286, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: level money respect capit also find capit activ power possessor agent given purpos alien posit object subject get invert capit becom put automat subject
TEXT: ” For Marx, value is “the subject of a process in which, while constantly assuming the form in turn of money and commodities, it changes its own magnitude, throws off surplus-value from itself considered as original value, and thus valorizes itself” (Marx 1976: 255; translation modified)., LINE: 2287, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: valu subject process constantli assum form turn money commod chang magnitud throw surplu valu consid origin valu thu translat
TEXT:  Externalization The constant pressure to lower the price of commodities leads tendentially to the externalization of outlays (= costs) that do not contribute to the sellability of commodities. Externalized aspects can then be re-internalized again, if they raise sellability in a given segment (for instance, organic and fair-trade products) and satisfy additional needs (“good conscience,” etc., LINE: 2288, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: extern constant pressur lower price commod lead extern outlay cost contribut commod aspect rais given segment instanc organ fair trade product satisfi addit need good conscienc
TEXT: ). A further possibility of forced re-internalization is represented by government legislation on compliance with certain standards. Such legislation is, however, subject to competition (among locations) to offer the best conditions for the valorization of capital., LINE: 2289, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: possibl forc intern govern legisl complianc certain standard legisl howev subject competit among locat offer best condit valor capit
TEXT:  This can trigger a dynamic of lowering standards (a “race to the bottom”): for example, with respect to taxes or environmental standards.

TEXT:  Despite all efforts to create a price for it within the commodity logic (CO2 emissions trading, etc.), it has not been possible up to now to reverse the trend or even just nearly compensate for it. Logic of Exclusion Externalization on the level of things corresponds to the logic of exclusion with respect to social relations., LINE: 2291, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: despit effort creat price within commod logic emiss trade ha possibl revers trend even nearli compens logic exclus extern level thing logic exclus respect social relat
TEXT:  By virtue of duplication, competition, and the compulsion to (self-)valorization, people are placed in a structural relation of exclusion. Analogously to competition and cooperation, the logic of exclusion is not opposed to reciprocity, but is rather a form of realization of the latter., LINE: 2292, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: virtu duplic competit compuls self valor peopl structur relat exclus analog competit logic exclus oppos reciproc rather form realiz latter
TEXT:  The logic of exclusion is manifest as an action rationality,13 according to which it is subjectively functional to prevail at the cost of others. This rationality can be grasped as structural conditional negative reciprocity., LINE: 2293, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: logic exclus manifest action ration accord subject function prevail cost ration structur condit neg reciproc
TEXT:  The opposition between the dimensions of use and mediation of the commodity is manifest as opposed interests in social interaction. The seller wants to obtain a high price, the buyer a low one; the buyer strives to have a high degree of satisfaction thanks to high quality, which the seller, for competitive reasons, will tend to minimize., LINE: 2294, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: opposit dimens use mediat commod manifest oppos interest social interact seller want obtain high price buyer low one buyer high degre satisfact thank high qualiti seller competit reason tend minim
TEXT: 14 Sellers—whether of products or their own labor-power—are in competition with one another.

TEXT:  Since the logic of exclusion is not a voluntary relationship, but rather a structural relationship, it cannot simply be eliminated because one wants to eliminate it—just as little as it is always the personal intention of one seller to cut out the other., LINE: 2296, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: sinc logic exclus voluntari relationship rather structur relationship cannot simpli one want elimin littl alway person intent one seller cut

TEXT:  Usefulness Due to the priority of mediation over usefulness, commodities have first to be sold before they can be consumed. Hence, money-earning by way of one’s own economic activities of (self-)valorization comes before purchase., LINE: 2300, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: use due prioriti mediat use commod first sold henc money earn way one econom activ self valor come purchas

TEXT:  Nonetheless, the relative share of unpaid activities—such as caring for children and the sick or disabled, relaxation, education, and volunteering—has fallen in the last decade (Schäfer 2004).

TEXT: ) Mediation As the concept already suggests, systemic self-mediation is connected to the moment of mediation of commodities: their value shape. This means that self-mediation, as supra-historical property of all societies, is realized in capitalism in the form of value-mediation or, reified, of monetary mediation., LINE: 2304, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: mediat concept alreadi system self mediat connect moment mediat commod valu shape mean self mediat histor properti societi capit form valu mediat monetari mediat
TEXT:  As consequence, however, the need/value and social/objective inversions that were analyzed above get imported into and become a component of societal self-mediation.

TEXT:  This means that a form of social self-mediation is possible in which relations are consciously organized around needs, such that society can be experienced not as something alien, but as something proper to individuals: as a set of interrelationships that correspond to individuals and their needs., LINE: 2307, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: mean form social self mediat possibl relat conscious organ around need societi experienc someth alien someth proper individu set correspond individu need
TEXT:  The initially separate analysis of sociality and commodity production makes it possible to recognize that every society has a self-reproductive character, but that this function merges with the “automatic subject” of endless valorization of value only in capitalism., LINE: 2308, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: initi separ analysi social commod product make possibl recogn everi societi ha self reproduct charact function automat subject endless valor valu capit
TEXT:  Two erroneous conclusions can thus be avoided: (1) that capitalism is the “natural” developed form of social self-mediation; (2) that a post-monetary society cannot involve any self-reproductive systemic self-mediation., LINE: 2309, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: two erron conclus thu capit natur form social self mediat post monetari societi cannot involv self reproduct system self mediat

TEXT:  Before doing so, however, a distinction has to be made among discourses, in order not to mix arguments illegitimately.

It is based on its own categories, which need to be elaborated, and it can only meaningfully be discussed within this discursive space., LINE: 2313, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: assumpt post monetari societi societi qualit distinct societi today base categori need meaning within discurs space
TEXT:  Discourse 2, which I call “transformation discourse,” concerns the transition from contemporary society, with the categorial foundations proper to it, to a post-monetary society and its own categorial foundations, which have first to be developed in the utopia discourse., LINE: 2314, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: discours call transform discours concern transit contemporari societi categori foundat proper post monetari societi categori foundat first utopia discours
TEXT:  The transformation cannot be meaningfully discussed without it being clear where it leads (cf. also Sutterlütti and Meretz 2018).16 The utopia discourse thus has priority and will be the focus in what follows., LINE: 2315, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: transform cannot meaning without clear lead also utopia discours thu ha prioriti focu
TEXT:  I thereby discuss starting points (“embryonic forms”) of a possible development in the here and now, as well as the necessary contradictoriness that the new must form under the given conditions (cf.

TEXT: 17 In order to be able to analyze embryonic forms of something new and contradictions in the real development at all, we need first to pursue the elaboration of the categories of a new form of social double mediation., LINE: 2317, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: order abl analyz embryon form someth new contradict real develop need first pursu elabor categori new form social doubl mediat
TEXT:  What is at issue here are questions like: Can a society that is not based on separate private production and competition (commodity production) “function” in a stable manner? What could new non-monetary forms of mediation look like? What could this mean for social relations of mediation and obligation? Post-Monetary Societies Now that the conceptual preconditions have been developed in the analysis of sociality in general and of capitalism in particular, we can use them for the development of the categorial foundations of a post-monetary society., LINE: 2318, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: issu question like societi base separ privat product competit commod product function stabl manner could new non monetari form mediat look like could mean social relat mediat oblig post monetari societi conceptu precondit analysi social gener capit particular use develop categori foundat post monetari societi

TEXT:  Hence, the baby is not to be thrown out with the bathwater. Rather, the bathwater has to be changed. Elementary Form: Commons What element-totality interrelationship creates the preconditions for the development of a post-monetary society? Or, to put it differently: As basic matrix of action, what element produces the totality of the new post-monetary societal system and is, at the same time, produced by it? The social micro-form that we are seeking cannot be created ex nihilo, but rather must already exist in undeveloped form—in embryonic form—as part of human-societal potentiality., LINE: 2320, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: henc babi thrown rather ha elementari form common element total precondit develop post monetari societi put differ basic matrix action element produc total new post monetari societ system time produc social micro form seek cannot rather must alreadi exist undevelop form embryon form part human societ potenti
TEXT:  The commons can be identified as this micro-form. According to the German Wikipedia entry, the concept refers to “resources (code, knowledge, food, energy sources, water, land, time, etc.) that come from self-organized processes of common needs-oriented production, administration, care, and/or use” (de., LINE: 2321, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: common micro form accord german entri concept resourc code knowledg food energi sourc water land time come self organ process common need product administr care use
TEXT: wikipedia.org/wiki/Commons; accessed November 14, 2017). When speaking of commons in what follows, we will always be doing so in the sense of emerging commons or new commons that took shape in the late phase of capitalism—as opposed to “residual” traditional commons (cf., LINE: 2322, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: common speak common alway sens common new common took shape late phase capit oppos residu tradit common

TEXT:  In capitalism, they find themselves in a, so to say, “hostile environment.” This means that embryonic forms that are present today can never have the quality of a constitutive elementary form in a corresponding total system (cf., LINE: 2324, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: capit find say hostil environ mean embryon form present today never qualiti constitut elementari form correspond total system
TEXT:  Meretz 2014b). In the conceptual development, the unfolding of present potentials can thus draw on existing, empirically available types of relations, but it must push the latter beyond the existing restrictions by capturing their own internal logic., LINE: 2325, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: conceptu develop unfold present potenti thu draw avail type relat must push latter beyond restrict intern logic

In what follows, I will summarize the results in relation to the categorial problem that has been raised here and contrast them to the forms of appearance known from commodity production. Ex Post and Ex Ante Mediation A first key difference is to be found in the relation between usefulness and mediation., LINE: 2327, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: summar result relat categori problem ha rais contrast form appear known commod product post ant mediat first key differ found relat use mediat
TEXT:  In the case of the commodity, the two dimensions follow separate action rationalities. Production is certainly about usefulness and potential need satisfaction, upon which, however, the primacy of value is superimposed., LINE: 2328, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: case commod two dimens follow separ action ration product certainli use potenti need satisfact upon howev primaci valu superimpos
TEXT:  For whether the potential for need satisfaction is also realized is only to be found out after production (ex post), if mediation, i.e. sale, actually succeeds and the commodity is consumed. This leads to the production of a gigantic collection of commodities, existing side-by-side, whose potential for satisfying needs has not been mediated among each other, since the mediation takes place not via the dimension of usefulness, but rather via the social comparison of outlay, viz., LINE: 2329, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: whether potenti need satisfact also found product post mediat sale actual commod lead product gigant collect commod side side whose potenti satisfi need ha among sinc mediat take place via dimens use rather via social comparison outlay
TEXT:  value. This has as consequence, in turn, that producers are (and must be) decisively oriented toward minimizing outlay or, in other words, cost reduction. In competition, the pressure is great to externalize all aspects of need that do not promote sellability, in order to lower costs., LINE: 2330, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: valu ha consequ turn produc must decis toward outlay word cost reduct competit pressur great extern aspect need promot order lower cost
TEXT:  From the point of view of the consumer, different needs come into competition with each other: What cheapens one commodity, and thus makes the need satisfaction it provides more easily accessible, leads, on the other hand, to an impairment of needs (for instance, in production by virtue of poor working conditions or low wages)., LINE: 2331, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: point view consum differ need come competit one commod thu make need satisfact easili access lead hand impair need instanc product virtu poor work condit low wage
TEXT:  The logic of exclusion on the level of social relations, which was described above, finds its counterpart on the level of the objective satisfaction of needs. Here too, the one need can exclude the other and the one satisfaction of need can harm the possibility of satisfying a need in a different domain., LINE: 2332, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: logic exclus level social relat wa find counterpart level object satisfact need one need exclud one satisfact need harm possibl satisfi need differ domain
TEXT:  As a rule, these relations of harm are distributed between different persons, such that the others at whose costs one lives remain, for the most part, invisible. But, due to the complexly cascading form of mediation, even when it is a matter of the same person, the connection is, for the most part, opaque., LINE: 2333, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: rule relat harm distribut differ person whose cost one life remain part invis due complexli form mediat even matter person connect part opaqu
TEXT:  Hence, the real connection between “wanting to purchase a commodity cheaply” and “not wanting to accept the externalizations that make the cheapening of the commodity possible”—or, in other words, the de facto self-damaging character of one’s own conduct—fails to be recognized., LINE: 2334, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: henc real connect want purchas commod cheapli want accept make commod possibl word self charact one conduct
TEXT:  This yet again makes clear that grasping commodity production as mere production of goods is conceptually inadequate, because the aspect of social form is thereby left out, with the consequences that have been shown here., LINE: 2335, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: yet make clear grasp commod product mere product good conceptu inadequ aspect social form therebi left consequ shown
TEXT:  The relation between usefulness and mediation takes a completely different form in the case of the commons. It does not here split up into different action rationalities, but rather the mediation takes place via the dimension of usefulness., LINE: 2336, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: relat use mediat take complet differ form case common doe split differ action ration rather mediat take place via dimens use
TEXT:  The needs that are connected to the usefulness are thereby directly and tendentially placed in a relationship before reproduction (ex ante). Already at this point, conflicts between needs can thus come to light and be mediated., LINE: 2337, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: need connect use therebi directli relationship reproduct ant alreadi point conflict need thu come light
TEXT: 20 Commons thus tend to internalize other needs: i.e. to find solutions that can satisfy the primary need without this occurring at the cost of secondary needs. To the logic of inclusion on the side of needs and their realization, there corresponds the same logic on the side of the social relations among actors., LINE: 2338, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: common thu tend intern need find solut satisfi primari need without cost secondari need logic inclus side need realiz logic side social relat among actor
TEXT:  Detailed descriptions of possible forms of mediation based on this will be provided below. To use a pointed formulation, ex post mediation has a remedial character, which can never entirely catch up or compensate (for instance, by way of public measures); whereas ex ante mediation is characterized by its structurally precautionary character., LINE: 2339, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: detail descript possibl form mediat base provid use point formul post mediat ha remedi charact never entir catch compens instanc way public measur wherea ant mediat structur precautionari charact
TEXT:  Reproductive Dimensions in Commons The precautionary production and maintenance of societal conditions of life—reproduction in the general sense described above—can be characterized by means of three reproductive dimensions., LINE: 2340, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: reproduct dimens common precautionari product mainten societ condit life reproduct gener sens mean three reproduct dimens
TEXT: 21 In the first place, resources enter into the process: whereby the concept of resources is comprehensively understood here as preconditions for reproduction and, in addition to natural resources, also includes (intermediate) products, knowledge and skills, as well as means of reproduction., LINE: 2341, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: first place resourc enter process wherebi concept resourc comprehens understood precondit reproduct addit natur resourc also intermedi product knowledg skill well mean reproduct
TEXT:  The process of reproduction then takes place in a—historically highly varying—social form and also produces the latter. Finally, at the end of a cycle of reproduction, we find products in the broadest sense, which serve to satisfy needs., LINE: 2342, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: process reproduct take place histor highli social form also produc latter final end cycl reproduct find product sens serv satisfi need
TEXT:  These include both material and symbolic goods (for more on the classification of goods, cf. Meretz 2009), as well as interpersonal services and (“care”) relationships. Per critical psychology, all needs have two basic and interrelated dimensions: the sensual-vital dimension and the productive dimension (H., LINE: 2343, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: includ materi symbol good classif good well interperson servic care relationship per critic psycholog need two basic interrel dimens sensual vital dimens product dimens
TEXT: -Osterkamp 1976). The sensual-vital dimension of need is directed toward individual contents of need (like eating, sexuality, security, etc.), which—as mediated by way of the productive dimension of need—can be achieved by participation in the disposition over the precautionary production of means of satisfaction., LINE: 2344, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: sensual vital dimens need direct toward individu content need like eat sexual secur way product dimens need particip disposit precautionari product mean satisfact
TEXT:  “Disposition has … a natural foundation in needs” (Küpper 2016: 50). Resources in the broad sense presented here enter into both commodity production and commons reproduction. But the purpose and hence the role of the resources differ considerably., LINE: 2345, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: disposit ha natur foundat need kupper resourc broad sens enter commod product common reproduct purpos henc role resourc differ consider
TEXT:  The purpose of commodity production is the production of sellable—which always means: competitively priced—commodities. Resources serve to achieve the required (or even simulated) sales quality at the lowest possible price., LINE: 2346, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: purpos commod product product sellabl alway mean competit price commod resourc serv achiev even sale qualiti possibl price
TEXT:  They enter into production as a cost factor that is to be minimized. The purpose of commons reproduction is achieving usefulness, in order to satisfy needs. If in commodity production, the relation to resources is essentially instrumental, extractive and remedial, in commons reproduction, it is essentially goal-oriented, preserving and precautionary (see above)., LINE: 2347, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: enter product cost factor purpos common reproduct use order satisfi need commod product relat resourc essenti instrument extract remedi common reproduct essenti goal precautionari see
TEXT:  The social practice of the commons is also described as commoning.22 It is the process of production and/or maintenance of useful goods intended for the satisfaction of needs, as well as of social relationships in the process., LINE: 2348, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: social practic common also process product mainten use good intend satisfact need well social relationship process
TEXT:  We can briefly mention the following features of commoning (features of commodity production are given in parentheses to bring out the contrast): •Freedom from domination and voluntariness (objective compulsion and personal command): Since, as a rule, there are structurally no instruments of power in commons, no one can be made to do something that he or she does not want to do, but rather participation occurs, in principle, on a voluntary basis., LINE: 2349, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: briefli mention follow featur featur commod product given parenthesi bring contrast freedom domin voluntari object compuls person command sinc rule structur instrument power common one made someth doe want rather particip principl voluntari basi
TEXT:  •Contributions (exchange): Interpersonal reciprocity is, in principle, unconditional (see above), so that no social obligation exists on the micro level. The motivation for such uncoupled contributions comes from the productive urge to want to take part in disposition over the collective (and hence societal) process, which is the precondition for securing individual existence., LINE: 2350, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: contribut exchang interperson reciproc principl uncondit see social oblig micro level motiv uncoupl contribut come product urg want take part disposit collect henc societ process precondit individu exist
TEXT:  •Individual self-development (marketable self-valorization): A further aspect of the productive need dimension is the structurally positive reciprocal development of each person’s own individuality. This means that one’s own development of individual possibilities is positively related to the development of others and presupposes it—and vice-versa., LINE: 2351, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: individu self develop market self valor aspect product need dimens structur posit reciproc develop person individu mean one develop individu possibl posit relat develop vice
TEXT:  •Collective self-organization (heteronomy): The differences in resources and products, as well as in the persons involved, is reflected in social organization. The participants come to agreement on the rules, which correspond both to their needs and to the conditions., LINE: 2352, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: collect self organ heteronomi differ resourc product well person involv reflect social organ particip come agreement rule correspond need condit
TEXT:  •Possession (property): What is decisive is really disposing of the resources that are necessary for reproduction. (On the difference between possession and property, cf. Meretz 2010.) Commons do not require any property, but on the basis of real possession, they can also exist under conditions of legal property., LINE: 2353, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: possess properti decis realli resourc necessari reproduct differ possess properti common requir properti basi real possess also exist condit legal properti
TEXT:  The results of commoning while using resources are material, symbolic and social products in the broadest possible sense.23 It here becomes clear that commons know no separation between production and reproduction., LINE: 2354, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: result resourc materi symbol social product possibl sens becom clear common know separ product reproduct
TEXT:  Instead, all—in the traditional sense—productive and reproductive conditions of social life are fulfilled. This means that commons do not generate the division into spheres that is well known from commodity production: namely, that into a male-structured public/value-productive sphere and a female-structured private/reproductive sphere (cf., LINE: 2355, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: instead tradit sens product reproduct condit social life mean common gener divis sphere well known commod product name male structur public valu product sphere femal structur privat reproduct sphere
TEXT:  Scholz 2000), each with its own action logics.

TEXT:  Commons Society Now that, implicitly anticipating the whole, the element of the commons in the element-totality interrelationship has been determined—the element only has its function amidst the whole—I want now to bring in the still outstanding determination of the social totality of a commons society., LINE: 2357, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: common societi implicitli whole element common element total ha determin element ha function amidst whole want bring still outstand determin social total common societi
TEXT:  To this end, reflections are required, in turn, about how this whole can be conceived precisely on the level of the whole. As conceptual means, I employ a network, which consists of nodes and links between the nodes or edges., LINE: 2358, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: end reflect turn whole precis level whole conceptu mean employ network node link node edg
TEXT:  A node is an individual commons. This is, in turn, itself a network of directly cooperating, interacting people. It represents the level of (inter-)subjective possibilities (see above). The commons society is, then, the transpersonal aggregate network of all socially cooperating mediated commons nodes and represents the level of objective necessities., LINE: 2359, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: node individu common turn network directli peopl level inter subject possibl see common societi transperson aggreg network social common node level object necess
TEXT:  Interpersonal and transpersonal relationships are depicted as edges and are based on the same qualitative-concrete mode of mediation (on which, more later). A society is, therefore, a layered transpersonal network of personal networks., LINE: 2360, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: interperson transperson relationship edg base qualit concret mode mediat later societi therefor layer transperson network person network
TEXT:  The topology of such a social network of mediation is characteristic for a specific social form, and hence this is also the case for the commons society. Topologically, the network of a commons society can be described as polycentric and scale-free, and the concept of stigmergy (to be explained below) is suitable for grasping the substantive quality of the mediation., LINE: 2361, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: topolog social network mediat characterist specif social form henc also case common societi network common societi polycentr scale free concept suitabl grasp substant qualiti mediat
TEXT:  In commons research, polycentricity is used, above all, to describe “self-organized … complex adaptive systems” (Ostrom and Ostrom 2009: 156), such as I have grasped them here as networks. When network systems grow, they do so not only through the emergence of new nodes and edges, but also by virtue of the fact that the network is permanently renovating itself structurally., LINE: 2362, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: common research use describ self organ complex adapt system network network system grow emerg new node edg also virtu fact network perman structur
TEXT:  A system is described as polycentric when it comprises several dispersed centers that take on governance functions. Certain nodes are increasingly assigned meta-tasks or, in other words, tasks involved in creating the preconditions for the functioning of the other nodes: for instance, developing infrastructure., LINE: 2363, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: system polycentr sever dispers center take govern function certain node increasingli assign meta task word task involv precondit node instanc infrastructur
TEXT:  Such poly-centers or meta-nodes (here: meta-commons) are also called hubs, and they draw numerous linkages to themselves. With increasingly non-hierarchical distribution of coordinating tasks across several nodes, I speak of distributed self-planning in the network., LINE: 2364, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: poli center meta node meta common also hub draw numer linkag increasingli non hierarch distribut task across sever node speak distribut self network
TEXT: 24 Along with the continuing inner polycentric differentiation of a large complex network, a scale-free distribution of the network density (or, in other words, of the incoming and outgoing edges) of the nodes is formed., LINE: 2365, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: along inner polycentr differenti larg complex network scale free distribut network densiti word incom outgo edg node form
TEXT:  This means that the topology is largely self-similar and hence the properties of the network are largely scale-independent: Sections of the network behave like the network as a whole. The ideality of the theory—networks that obey a power law are scale-invariant—has, however, a lower limit in reality: Partial networks that are too small no longer function like the network as a whole., LINE: 2366, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: mean topolog larg self similar henc properti network larg scale independ section network behav like network whole ideal theori network obey power law scale invari ha howev lower limit realiti partial network small longer function like network whole
TEXT:  Nonetheless, partial scale-independence is an essential property of social organization, since it secures a high degree of robustness vis-à-vis node failures or, in other words, partial damage to the networking (such as occurs, say, during disasters)., LINE: 2367, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: nonetheless partial scale independ essenti properti social organ sinc high degre robust node failur word partial damag say disast
TEXT: 25 Consideration of the topology does not yet tell us anything about the substantive quality of the edges: i.e. about the relations of mediation between persons and commons. This is the subject of the following section., LINE: 2368, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: consider topolog doe yet tell anyth substant qualiti edg relat mediat person common subject follow section
TEXT:  Stigmergy The concept of stigmergy is derived from the Greek words stigma (στιγμα) for marking and ergon (εργον) for labor. It was coined by the French biologist Pierre-Paul Grassé (1959), who studied the emerging behavior of termites., LINE: 2369, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: concept deriv word stigma mark ergon labor wa biologist studi behavior termit
TEXT:  In general terms, localized signs indicate subsequent follow-up activities or desired new activities. Francis Heylighen (2007) applied the concept of stigmergy to commons-based peer production (cf.

TEXT:  Stigmergy is not a novel form of mediation that is limited to a possible commons society, but rather an aspect of every society. The market can, thus, be grasped as a stigmergic system. Here, we will unpack how stigmergy can come to bear as a new principle of post-monetary mediation., LINE: 2371, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: novel form mediat limit possibl common societi rather aspect everi societi market thu system unpack come bear new principl post monetari mediat
TEXT:  In what follows, we present these considerations and discuss them with respect to the following aspects: decisions, conflicts, information, bandwidth, coordination, and planning. Decisions Collective provision for society as a whole requires that decisions be made about what will be done and how., LINE: 2372, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: present consider discu respect follow aspect decis conflict inform decis collect provis societi whole decis made done
TEXT:  Nowadays, hierarchical procedures are usually employed, in which decision-making power increases the higher one goes in the hierarchy. To this end, field information has to be aggregated upwards, condensed into a decision, and allocated downwards again in the form of process instructions., LINE: 2373, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: nowaday hierarch procedur usual employ decis make power increas higher one go hierarchi end field inform ha upward condens decis form process instruct
TEXT:  This is meant to ensure that processes involving a division of activity lead to a consistent result. Marx criticized the separation of decision and execution as the “enslaving subordination of individuals under the division of labor” (Marx 1938: 10)., LINE: 2374, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: meant ensur process divis activ lead consist result separ decis execut subordin individu divis labor
TEXT:  By virtue of this separation, as well as the lack of transparency and limitation of individual opportunity for development that come about when there are many hierarchical levels and a high degree of subdivision into particular steps, a considerable loss of motivation can occur, and external rewards (e., LINE: 2375, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: virtu separ well lack transpar limit individu opportun develop come mani hierarch level high degre subdivis particular step consider loss motiv occur extern reward
TEXT: g. monetary gratification) are not able to compensate for it (cf. Deci et al. 1999). The flattening of hierarchies and the creation of areas of individual initiative reduces the discrepancy, but cannot offer a fundamental solution to the problem of motivation., LINE: 2376, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: monetari gratif abl compens flatten hierarchi creation area individu initi discrep cannot offer fundament solut problem motiv
TEXT: 26 This is all the more the case, inasmuch as under conditions of commodity production, the incentives for production are not need-based, but rather value-based. Different variants of majority decision and consensus are often mentioned and applied as alternatives to hierarchical decision-making processes., LINE: 2377, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: case inasmuch condit commod product incent product need base rather valu base differ variant major decis consensu often appli altern hierarch decis make process
TEXT:  It is claimed that, above all, consensual procedures involve all parties and thus lead to greater motivation than, say, majority decisions. But even consensual procedures have their limits. A consensus is not based on the full agreement of all parties, but rather on a collective process of coming to a decision with which all parties can live and to which, in the end, they can all submit in the interest of common action., LINE: 2378, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: consensu procedur involv parti thu lead greater motiv say major decis even consensu procedur limit consensu base full agreement parti rather collect process come decis parti live end submit interest common action
TEXT:  The decision and the information that is relevant to it are transparent for the parties; nonetheless—or precisely for this reason—it is often the case that a decision needs to be discussed at great length., LINE: 2379, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: decis inform relev transpar parti nonetheless precis reason often case decis need great length
TEXT:  The mere fact that a consensus is brought about does not automatically create motivation for all parties. For it can happen that some subordinate their individual views and needs, in the interest of reaching a decision, and this can adversely affect their motivation., LINE: 2380, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: mere fact consensu brought doe automat creat motiv parti happen subordin individu view need interest reach decis advers affect motiv
TEXT:  If outside factors impact the decision-making process—say, the necessity of taking external economic constraints into account—the difference between one’s own wishes and the externally influenced compulsion can have further negative effects., LINE: 2381, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: outsid factor impact decis make process say necess take extern econom constraint account differ one wish extern compuls neg effect
TEXT:  Self-selection inverts the direction of the decision: Instead of needing to bring a—whether hierarchically or consensually made—decision to people (with whatever degree of (internalized) pressure), people themselves seek out the decision that is right for them., LINE: 2382, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: self select direct decis instead need bring whether hierarch consensu made decis peopl whatev degre pressur peopl seek decis right
TEXT:  On the basis of locally available information, which may indeed have global character, they choose the constellation in which they want to be or to become active.

TEXT:  In a commons society, moreover, it is not counteracted by external pressures (to valorize or the like).27 There thus arises a kind of “do-ocracy” (Habermann 2009: 140f.), in which actors take responsibility for the process and own it., LINE: 2384, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: common societi moreov extern pressur valor like thu kind ocraci actor take respons process
TEXT:  Conflicts The responsibilities of the process owner also include dealing with limitations and conflicts.

TEXT:  On the one hand, the infrastructural preconditions for amassing power (the state, property, repressive instances, etc.) are lacking. On the other hand, the organization of interests for the purpose of realizing needs at the expense of others is off-putting and reduces the willingness to cooperate., LINE: 2386, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: one hand precondit power state properti repress instanc hand organ interest purpos realiz need expens willing
TEXT:  Just as under the conditions of an exclusionary logic, where good reasons exist to prevail, by way of the effective organization of interests, at the expense of others, under the conditions of an inclusionary logic, there are good reasons for everyone continually to win over others as partners for realizing their own respective needs., LINE: 2387, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: condit exclusionari logic good reason exist prevail way effect organ interest expens condit logic good reason everyon continu win partner realiz respect need
TEXT:  What is more: It becomes increasingly evident, both emotionally and cognitively, that the needs of others are fundamentally included in my needs—not in every individual case, but on average. This means that by satisfying the needs of others, I can also satisfy my own needs., LINE: 2388, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: becom increasingli evid emot cognit need fundament includ need everi individu case averag mean satisfi need also satisfi need
TEXT:  In a certain way, this also gives rise to competition: not, however, in the old exclusive sense, but rather in the sense of an inclusive winning over of others for the purpose of cooperation. Conflicts that, nonetheless, arise in the process (due, say, to limited possibilities for realization) can likewise only be resolved in a cooperative fashion: by prioritizing implementation, by the search for alternative solutions and, finally, also by individually (or also collectively) seeking out cooperative contexts that are better suited to satisfying one’s needs (per the principle of self-selection)., LINE: 2389, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: certain way also give rise competit howev old exclus sens rather sens inclus win purpos conflict nonetheless aris process due say limit possibl realiz likewis resolv fashion implement search altern solut final also individu also collect seek context better satisfi one need per principl self select
TEXT:  Competition is thus a competition for inclusiveness. Whether sanctions still have a constitutive role for conflict resolution under these circumstances is debatable (cf. the discussion by Siefkes, Meretz and Habermann in the present volume)., LINE: 2390, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: competit thu competit inclus whether sanction still constitut role conflict resolut circumst debat discuss present volum
TEXT: 28 Information The information that mediates processes and decisions can have two sources: Direct process information—also called “sematectonic”29 information—emerges in and along with the activity; indirect or marker-based information is information that accompanies the activity and serves for planning and coordination., LINE: 2391, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: inform inform process decis two sourc direct process inform also inform along activ indirect marker base inform inform activ serf
TEXT:  Direct process information includes. among other things, measurements, status signals,30 tracking data (cf. Kathöfer and Schröter in the present volume), and affective signals between people. Indirect process-steering information includes requirement descriptions, to-do lists, discussions, plans, statistics, wish lists, etc., LINE: 2392, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: direct process inform among thing measur statu signal data present volum affect signal peopl indirect process steer inform requir descript list discuss plan statist wish list
TEXT:  Such qualitative information emerges in advance of or from processes that create the immaterial and material conditions for the satisfaction of needs. In comparison to merely indirect, monetary-quantitative formats, they depict these needs qualitatively and directly., LINE: 2393, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: qualit inform advanc process creat immateri materi condit satisfact need comparison mere indirect monetari quantit format depict need qualit directli
TEXT:  Above all, interpersonal information must not be technically mediated, however, but rather can be directly exchanged: especially, for instance, in the case of personal care activities. On the other hand, the medial mediation of information comes to bear, above all, in the case of transpersonal coordination., LINE: 2394, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: interperson inform must technic howev rather directli especi instanc case person care activ hand medial mediat inform come bear case transperson

TEXT:  Both local and global information that is available in situ facilitates local decision-making and action. In a commons society, this information is qualitative in character and capable of depicting people’s needs., LINE: 2397, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: local global inform avail local decis make action common societi inform qualit charact capabl peopl need
TEXT:  Local action is thus inclusive and need-oriented, since it develops to a large degree on the basis of the needs of others. Exclusive behavior remains entirely possible; but it is dysfunctional and hence does not become decisive., LINE: 2398, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: local action thu inclus need sinc larg degre basi need exclus behavior remain entir possibl henc doe becom decis
TEXT:  Indirect coordination leads to disequilibria being continuously propagated throughout the network until a dynamic coherence is also established on the level of the societal system. This means that a state of ideal equilibrium is never reached, but that disequilibria provide signals for local action., LINE: 2399, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: indirect lead continu throughout network dynam coher also establish level societ system mean state ideal equilibrium never provid signal local action
TEXT: 31 The idea of an essentially static equilibrium (such as also predominates in the tradition of neoclassical theory formation) is erroneous, since all parameters (needs, procedures, resources, etc.) are continuously changing, such that the guiding concept is rather systemic self-adaptation on the basis of collective intelligence., LINE: 2400, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: idea essenti static equilibrium also tradit theori format erron sinc paramet need procedur resourc continu concept rather system self adapt basi collect intellig
TEXT:  What drives the emerging coherence is not, however, an abstraction—like value in the case of the market—which indirectly mediates needs, but rather needs themselves. Planning Stigmergic emergence means that—like the “invisible hand” (Adam Smith) in the case of market mediation—social coherence is produced “behind the backs” (Karl Marx) of actors, but that this does not occur blindly, but rather with complete transparency., LINE: 2401, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: drive coher howev abstract like valu case market indirectli need rather need emerg mean like invis hand smith case market mediat social coher produc behind back actor doe occur blindli rather complet transpar
TEXT:  By way of conscious action, the social process of distributed self-planning can be re-directed, without, however, being subject to the illusion that a complete organization of social relations is possible., LINE: 2402, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: way consciou action social process distribut self direct without howev subject illus complet organ social relat possibl
TEXT:  Every attempt to plan the societal totality—or even to do so from a privileged (central) position—ends up in totalitarian forms of rule. But how can social transparency be produced, in order to bring adaptive moments into distributed self-planning? Traditionally, this is the task of politics., LINE: 2403, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: everi attempt plan societ total even privileg central posit end totalitarian form rule social transpar produc order bring adapt moment distribut self tradit task polit
TEXT:  But, here too, I assume that the political functions of systemic orientation and adaptation do not belong to a separate sphere, but are rather embedded in the societal process of mediation. Since there is no mediating abstraction outside of the mediation of needs, an independent instance of redistribution, decision-making and priority-setting has no proper function., LINE: 2404, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: assum polit function system orient adapt belong separ sphere rather societ process mediat sinc mediat abstract outsid mediat need independ instanc redistribut decis make prioriti set ha proper function
TEXT:  Adaptation, decision-making and prioritization are rather tasks that are distributed over the network, although they can also be concentrated in hubs as meta-tasks (see above on polycentricity). Blockchain Here a technology comes into play that is currently experiencing a precipitous rise: blockchain (Hülsbömer and Genovese 2017)., LINE: 2405, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: adapt decis make rather task distribut network although also concentr hub meta task see technolog come play current precipit rise
TEXT:  Blockchain gained notoriety thanks to the bitcoin cryptocurrency. In essence, however, it is just a distributed protocol that transparently records actors’ transactions in a chronological memory: also known as a ledger., LINE: 2406, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: notorieti thank essenc howev distribut protocol transpar record actor transact chronolog memori also known ledger
TEXT:  This ledger is not located in any particular place and is also not subject to central administration. Instead, it is distributed over the internet. It belongs to all and is administered by all. The cryptographic interlinking of blocks, in which the transactions are saved, prevents ex post alterations and provides a secure depiction of the temporal sequence of the transactions., LINE: 2407, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: ledger particular place also subject central administr instead distribut cryptograph block transact save post alter secur depict tempor sequenc transact
TEXT:  Blockchain is a kind of globally distributed operating system for agreements between peers: The peers no longer need intermediaries and applications are running on the operating system that allow everyone access to the agreements., LINE: 2408, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: kind global distribut oper system agreement peer peer longer need intermediari applic run oper system allow everyon access agreement
TEXT:  A blockchain system could replace contracts without agreements losing the binding character that today has still to be created by way of law and the state. This binding character can be achieved via transparency and social influence through voting with one’s feet: Someone who frequently fails to uphold agreements that are consultable by everyone, or who only implements them to the detriment of one side, will less often find partners who want to enter into new agreements., LINE: 2409, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: system could replac contract without agreement lose bind charact today ha still way law state bind charact via transpar social influenc vote one foot someon frequent uphold agreement consult everyon implement detriment one side less often find partner want enter new agreement
TEXT:  In this way, the inclusionary logic described above can find its operative basis: Inclusive-cooperative behavior is self-reinforcing and one’s own needs are more likely to be satisfied, if the needs of one’s peers are also taken into account., LINE: 2410, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: way logic find oper basi inclus behavior self one need like satisfi need one peer also taken account
TEXT:  Despite the generality of the blockchain protocol, it is not necessary to record all domains of society, since interpersonal relationships, above all, can manage entirely without transparent documentation., LINE: 2411, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: despit gener protocol necessari record domain societi sinc interperson relationship manag entir without transpar document
TEXT:  Blockchain is, above all, suitable for transpersonal mediations, in which persons who are unknown to one another can create an equal—peer-to-peer—basis of trust by means of transparency. Summary and Discussion Stigmergic Mediation In a commons society, a stigmergic mediation based on qualitative information can be conceived as a form of indirect and emergent self-management for the purpose of communicative mediation of needs, resources, limitations, and goals., LINE: 2412, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: suitabl transperson mediat person unknown one anoth creat equal peer peer basi trust mean transpar summari discuss mediat common societi mediat base qualit inform form indirect emerg self manag purpos commun mediat need resourc limit goal
TEXT:  The principle of self-selection on the individual level leads to a similar shift in focus on the systemic level of the whole: Instead of organizing processes directly by means of central planning, the objective is rather to create the conditions for social self-organization, which then gives rise to stigmergically distributed network planning., LINE: 2413, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: principl self select individu level lead similar shift focu system level whole instead process directli mean central object rather creat condit social self organ give rise distribut network
TEXT:  Thanks to the inclusionary logic, the network effect (Yang 1997) comes fully to bear by way of self-reinforcing feedback: Inclusionary behavior is functional and creates the conditions for inclusionary behavior., LINE: 2414, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: thank logic network effect yang come fulli bear way self feedback behavior function condit behavior
TEXT:  Effectiveness (the degree of goal attainment) is high, thanks to the direct stimulus of need and direct peer-to-peer forms of mediation without intermediaries. The same applies for efficiency (the required outlay for goal attainment), since transaction outlays are minimal—in contrast to monetary mediation, whereby society has to make major outlays just for the purpose of maintaining and operating the monetary system and these outlays are useless as directly regards the satisfaction of needs., LINE: 2415, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: effect degre goal attain high thank direct stimulu need direct peer peer form mediat without intermediari effici outlay goal attain sinc transact outlay minim contrast monetari mediat wherebi societi ha make major outlay purpos oper monetari system outlay useless directli regard satisfact need
TEXT: 32 This is possible thanks to the multi-dimensional substantive quality of information, whose capacity for mediation via the qualitatively employed bandwidth is considerably greater than the one-dimensional, purely quantitative representational capacity of money., LINE: 2416, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: possibl thank dimension substant qualiti inform whose capac mediat via qualit employ consider greater one dimension pure quantit capac money
TEXT:  Stigmergic mediation takes place more on the transpersonal level of larger and more diverse systems—such as are present on the level of society as a whole—than in small units. For the transpersonal level, the Stigmergic Law can be formulated as follows: “Given enough people and commons, a person or commons will be found for every task that has to be done., LINE: 2417, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: mediat take place transperson level divers system present level societi whole small unit transperson level law given enough peopl common person common found everi task ha done
TEXT: ”33 A blockchain operating system for agreements thus makes reached agreements transparent for all, and this provides the foundation for an, on average, highly binding character and a high degree of dependability on the basis of the free choice of the individual., LINE: 2418, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: oper system agreement thu make agreement transpar foundat averag highli bind charact high degre depend basi free choic individu
TEXT:  Knowledge and Capacity for Action Is commons-based stigmergy another way of solving the Hayekian problem of knowledge (cf. Kathöfer and Schröter in the present volume)? The problem consists in the fact that in a society based on the division of labor, knowledge is always only contextual, local, limited, and dispersed., LINE: 2419, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: knowledg capac action common base anoth way problem knowledg present volum problem fact societi base divis labor knowledg alway contextu local limit dispers
TEXT:  Friedrich von Hayek ([1937] 1948: 54) asked: “How can the combination of fragments of knowledge existing in different minds bring about results which, if they were to be brought about deliberately, would require a knowledge on the part of the directing mind which no single person can possess?”—and he concluded thereby that central planning is, in principle, impossible., LINE: 2420, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: combin fragment knowledg differ mind bring result brought deliber would requir knowledg part mind singl person possess therebi central principl imposs
TEXT:  In order to achieve capacity for action, he argued, it is necessary to reduce divided knowledge to manageable quantities and to subject it to a self-mediation. Per Hayek, the latter are “prices” and “competition” on the market, which produces “complex, seemingly intelligent structures, without need for any planning, control, or even direct communication between the agents., LINE: 2421, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: order achiev capac action necessari reduc divid knowledg manag quantiti subject self mediat per latter price competit market produc complex seemingli intellig structur without need control even direct commun agent
TEXT: ” The last quote is not from Hayek, but rather a phrase from the Wikipedia entry on “Stigmergy” (en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stigmergy; accessed April 8, 2018). This shows that market mediation by way of prices is one possible form of stigmergy; but it is the least favorable one conceivable, because the limited informational capacity of merely quantitative price signals does not allow for any qualitative coordination., LINE: 2422, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: last quot rather phrase entri show market mediat way price one possibl form least favor one conceiv limit inform capac mere quantit price signal doe allow qualit
TEXT:  Matters are otherwise in commons-based stigmergy, in which the effect of coordination is just as indirect and emergent as in the case of the price mechanism. Since, however, the basic motor is not valorization, but rather need, the emerging coherent overall outcome is a society in which need-satisfaction is optimal for all., LINE: 2423, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: matter otherwis common base effect indirect emerg case price mechan sinc howev basic motor valor rather need coher overal outcom societi need satisfact optim
TEXT:  As remarked at the outset, however, it should not be assumed that this comparison is about a simple “substitute” for money. Rather, the discussed problems of a society facing the abyss of money34 can only be resolved when commons-mediated stigmergy is part of an ex ante reproduction, in which needs are not first reduced to one-dimensional, merely quantitative variables, but are mediated rather in their fully qualitative character., LINE: 2424, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: outset howev assum comparison simpl substitut money rather problem societi face abyss money resolv common part ant reproduct need first reduc one dimension mere quantit variabl rather fulli qualit charact
TEXT:  Social Obligation What happens with non-monetary debt relations—or, in other words, social obligations—that arise in a society based on the division of activity, if the ways in which obligations are met are interconnected? Do not these social obligations catch up with us and, in the end, find their operative expression in the form of money, after all? The question for a post-monetary society is hence whether and for what domains (inter-individual, collective, societal) unconditional reciprocity relations (see above) can be available., LINE: 2425, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: social oblig non monetari debt relat word social oblig aris societi base divis activ way oblig met social oblig catch end find oper express form money question post monetari societi henc whether domain inter individu collect societ uncondit reciproc relat see avail
TEXT:  It is clear that on the societal level, a conditionality of reciprocity—or, in other words, the mutual production of necessities of life via the creation and use of means and services for the purpose of satisfying needs—cannot be eliminated., LINE: 2426, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: clear societ level condition reciproc word mutual product necess life via creation use mean servic purpos satisfi need cannot
TEXT: 35 From a systemic perspective, it is irrelevant who makes the necessary contributions, as long as it is assured, on average, that it securely takes place. As shown, this can be achieved by way of stigmergic mediation., LINE: 2427, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: system perspect irrelev make necessari contribut long assur averag secur take place shown way mediat
TEXT:  Hence, both individually and collectively, there is no compulsion to link utilizations and contributions on the societal level. This means that a commons collective is also under no compulsion to make sure that utilizations and contributions balance out on the collective level., LINE: 2428, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: henc individu collect compuls link util contribut societ level mean common collect also compuls make sure util contribut balanc collect level
TEXT: 36 This is an important quality of a commons society, since it is often—say, in the domain of care—not possible to bring about such a balance: as is nowadays attempted by means, for instance, of an imposed economic and value-based equivalence regime., LINE: 2429, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: import qualiti common societi sinc often say domain care possibl bring balanc nowaday mean instanc econom valu base equival regim
TEXT:  This applies in the same way for the individual level: Even those people who are not able to make contributions have a claim to undiminished use of social wealth. Moreover, if we free ourselves from the abstract economic idea of equivalence, it becomes apparent that there are numerous contributions to the social mode of life or to culture, in the broadest sense, that up to now—because they cannot be economically represented—do not exist: because they do not pay and are not economically perceptible., LINE: 2430, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: way individu level even peopl abl make contribut claim undiminish use social wealth moreov free abstract econom idea equival becom appar numer contribut social mode life cultur sens cannot econom exist pay econom percept
TEXT:  Strictly speaking, every development of individual possibilities in each unique form of human being is a contribution to this mode of life. This means that the linking of utilizations and contributions that has hitherto taken place first presupposes an individualized and privatized separation of economic performance that, in fact, does not exist at all., LINE: 2431, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: strictli speak everi develop individu possibl uniqu form human contribut mode life mean link util contribut ha hitherto taken place first separ econom perform fact doe exist
TEXT:  Utilizations and contributions can indeed be analytically distinguished. But concretely it is always only a matter of differently weighted moments of a unitary process of individual participation in social reproduction by way of individual development of life chances., LINE: 2432, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: util contribut inde analyt distinguish concret alway matter differ weight moment unitari process individu particip social reproduct way individu develop life chanc
TEXT:  It is only in a free society of decoupled reciprocity on both the individual and collective levels that this identity can come to the fore with its moments of utilizations and contributions, since all contributions are socially recognized., LINE: 2433, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: free societi reciproc individu collect level ident come fore moment util contribut sinc contribut social
TEXT: 37 But what about inter-individual relations of obligation? Is not the moral sense that giving should be compensated by giving in return deeply ingrained in our historically acquired social relations? This can hardly be denied., LINE: 2434, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: inter individu relat oblig moral sens give give return deepli ingrain histor acquir social relat hardli
TEXT:  But what has been socially acquired can just as well be unacquired again. What is decisive for the argumentation presented here, however, is that the unlearning of social relations of obligation on the inter-individual level of reciprocity is not a categorial precondition for unconditional relations of mediation on supra-individual levels., LINE: 2435, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: ha social acquir well unacquir decis argument howev unlearn social relat oblig inter individu level reciproc categori precondit uncondit relat mediat individu level
TEXT:  Whether, in a free society, we thus see ourselves as having obligations toward individual persons or, rather, we are able dispassionately to perceive the fundamental structural unconditional positive reciprocity is, for the moment, undecidable., LINE: 2436, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: whether free societi thu see oblig toward individu person rather abl dispassion perceiv fundament structur uncondit posit reciproc moment undecid

TEXT:  One of these authors is the world’s best-known futurologist, the economist Jeremy Rifkin.

TEXT:  And much the same can be said about how early societies were organized: without capitalism, that is, without the structural compulsion to turn money into more money; without labor, that is, without the appropriation of the surplus product from an activity by another person; without property, that is, without the right to exclude others from the use of a good unless one is using it oneself, and without money and exchange, that is, without any value relation that predetermines, when resources are exchanged, who still owes what to whom., LINE: 2529, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: much said earli societi organ without capit without structur compuls turn money money without labor without appropri surplu product activ anoth person without properti without right exclud use good unless one oneself without money exchang without valu relat resourc still

TEXT:  Of course “feminist economics” is a broad concept: there are many feminisms and many orientations within economic theory, and theoretically any combination of the two is possible. But what is meant here is neither games-theory-based reflections from a woman’s perspective, as are sometimes to be found in the International Association for Feminist Economics, nor Keynes-inspired reflections on the (entirely reasonable) notion of “gender budgeting,” that is, the practice of taking into consideration gender-specific inequalities in budgetary policy., LINE: 2535, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: cours feminist econom broad concept mani femin mani orient within econom theori theoret combin two possibl meant neither game theori base reflect woman perspect sometim found intern associ feminist econom inspir reflect entir reason notion gender practic take consider gender specif inequ budgetari polici
TEXT:  In the German-speaking countries, since the 1980s, “feminist economics” has largely stood for analyses, mainly from an eco-feminist perspective, of the exploitation of nature, traditional women’s or reproductive work, and the (post-)colonial North-South relationship—all of this combined with the positive vision of a “subsistence” society, free of money and the logic of exchange., LINE: 2536, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: german speak countri sinc feminist econom ha larg stood analysi mainli feminist perspect exploit natur tradit woman reproduct work post coloni north south relationship combin posit vision subsist societi free money logic exchang

TEXT:  This was an extremely valuable contribution: building on Rosa Luxemburg’s analysis, it shows that the aim of capitalism is not to permeate the world with capitalism, i.e. not to transform every kind of work into wage labor, but that on the contrary a vital element for the survival of capitalism is its imperialistic ability to exploit resources produced in a non-capitalist manner., LINE: 2538, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: wa extrem valuabl contribut build analysi show aim capit permeat world capit transform everi kind work wage labor contrari vital element surviv capit imperialist abil exploit resourc produc non capitalist manner

TEXT:  Möller 1997). Yet even today there is a systematic tendency to overlook reproductive or care activities, and therefore the prerequisites for what is generally understood as the “economy”. “It really is unfathomable,” as Carola Möller noted twenty years ago, “why it has so far been possible to make unpaid work appear, in the public consciousness, as non-existent and without value” (1998: 471)., LINE: 2542, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: yet even today systemat tendenc overlook reproduct care activ therefor prerequisit gener understood economi realli unfathom note twenti year ago ha far possibl make unpaid work appear public conscious non exist without valu

TEXT:  Claudia von Werlhof raises the question of whether capitalism is so incapable that it has not yet succeeded in integrating these masses into exploitation, into its system. According to her, the answer to the riddle is very simple: “everything is the reverse of what it seemed: the pillars of accumulation and growth are not the 10 percent free wage laborers, but the 90 percent unfree nonwage laborers; they are the truly exploited, the real ‘producers,’ the ‘norm,’ the general condition of the human being under capitalism” (Werlhof 1984: 257)., LINE: 2544, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: rais question whether capit incap ha yet mass exploit system accord answer riddl simpl everyth revers pillar accumul growth percent free wage labor percent unfre labor truli real produc norm gener condit human capit

TEXT:  It then becomes possible to speak of extending the “logic of care” to production. Money divides individuals, as Veronika Bennholdt-Thomsen later also stresses in her book Geld oder Leben (Money or life, 2010); the immediacy of subsistence provision, in contrast, brings them together (2010: 46)., LINE: 2546, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: becom possibl speak extend logic care product money divid individu later also stress book geld money life immediaci subsist provis contrast togeth
TEXT:  However, the concept of subsistence for socialized economic activity beyond the market and the state has been repeatedly misunderstood.

TEXT:  The “women of Bielefeld” used the term “subsistence approach” (Subsistenzansatz) to stress the need for progressive self-liberation from capitalist, market-mediated constraints. The catchphrase “politicized subsistence,” coined by Ulla Peters (1997), encapsulated the creation of collective structures of resistance beyond the state and the market more clearly, and connected more explicitly with an internationalist perspective., LINE: 2549, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: woman use term subsist approach stress need progress self liber capitalist market constraint subsist ulla peter creation collect structur resist beyond state market clearli connect explicitli perspect

TEXT:  Here is an outline of the core ideas. Playing on the word “economy,” I speak of “ecommony,” to emphasize the potential which the commons hold for the whole of society.

But “impure public goods” such as water supply, wastewater disposal, or any kind of public transport and infrastructure where consumption involves a certain rivalry, can also be organized according to the principle of possession instead of ownership—probably very few people would think of using them excessively just because they are free., LINE: 2564, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: good free access doe limit access anyon non rival good impur public good water suppli dispos kind public transport infrastructur consumpt certain rivalri also organ accord principl possess instead ownership probabl peopl would think excess free
TEXT:  Needs are met relatively quickly. Even food—to name what is probably the most rivalrous among the rival goods—can be categorized in this way: food can only be “possessed” if it is eaten.

TEXT:  Possession rather than ownership can also refer to everyday objects, however. On the one hand those where serial use is possible, as they are no longer needed after use.

TEXT:  This trend is also reflected in “free stores” or “give-away shops,” which work like second-hand shops, just without money and without the logic of exchange. These are not to be understood as places where things are “given,” that is, transferred from one private owner to another, but as places where people bring things that have “fallen out of possession,” since they are no longer used., LINE: 2568, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: trend also reflect free store give away shop work like second hand shop without money without logic exchang understood place thing given transfer one privat owner anoth place peopl bring thing fallen possess sinc longer use
TEXT:  Parallel or alternating use is also possible, for example in the case of tools, which—unlike books—are not “finished with” at some point. For this there are “user communities,” “libraries of things” or “borrowing shops,” and open workshops, equipped for woodwork or metalwork, bike repair or sewing workshops, or “FabLabs” with 3D printers., LINE: 2569, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: parallel altern use also possibl exampl case tool unlik book finish point user commun librari thing borrow shop open workshop woodwork metalwork bike repair sew workshop printer
TEXT:  After all, not only products but also the means of production should be in the possession of those who need (and use) them. The increasing decentralization and thus democratization of production opportunities means—and this is Rifkin’s central thesis—“that anyone and eventually everyone can access the means of production, making the question of who should own and control the means of production irrelevant, and capitalism with it” (2014: 112)., LINE: 2570, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: product also mean product possess need use increas thu democrat product opportun mean central thesi anyon eventu everyon access mean product make question control mean product irrelev capit

TEXT:  It is no coincidence that it is predominantly feminist theorists who, based on the recognition of a lifelong mutual dependency, emphasize this broad spectrum of motivations. Brigitte Kratzwald (2014) sums it up with the phrase “between pleasure and necessity,” while the theologian Ina Praetorius, who lives in Switzerland, describes such motivations for action as the “rediscovery of what has been taken for granted” (Wiederentdeckung des Selbstverständlichen): the fact that most of us become active as a matter of course when we see the necessity for it., LINE: 2573, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: coincid predominantli feminist theorist base recognit lifelong mutual depend emphas broad spectrum motiv sum phrase pleasur necess theologian life motiv action rediscoveri ha taken de fact becom activ matter cours see necess
TEXT:  “It can be taken for granted that humans, as creatures who are free in relatedness, want to increase more than their personal benefits” (2015: 54). This should not be confused with altruism.

Both approaches are strongly linked to an understanding of nature such as that expressed by the indigenous concept of “Pachamama” (Mother Earth): nature is not seen as separate from humans, and as an exploitable resource; instead humans are to be understood as a part of nature; in this sense the original indigenous expressions for buen vivir—generally rendered as “good living”—can perhaps be better translated as “good living together., LINE: 2594, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: time keep idea care concern differ attitud natur seen anoth thing care common share approach strongli link understand natur express indigen concept mother earth natur seen separ human exploit resourc instead human understood part natur sens origin indigen express gener good live perhap better good live togeth
TEXT: ” Care activities are focused on the well-being of others, and therefore do not lend themselves to profitable exploitation. Thus those who work in this area, mostly women, often have fewer problems overcoming the logic of exchange, because the logic of care allows a different way of looking at economic activity as a whole: if giving food to a sick person is care, why should growing the food not be care? If putting a child to bed is care, why should producing the bed not be care? Furthermore, the area of reproductive work, or more precisely care work, highlights something that is true of any form of activity: that it inevitably becomes alienated as long as it is carried out in exchange for food (German: Lebensmittel, literally “the means of life”), and therefore under compulsion., LINE: 2595, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: care activ well therefor lend profit exploit thu work area mostli woman often problem logic exchang logic care differ way look econom activ whole give food sick person care grow food care child bed care bed care furthermor area reproduct work precis care work highlight someth true form activ inevit becom long carri exchang food german liter mean life therefor compuls

TEXT:  Moreover, if we are to avoid constructing people as inferior in order to be able to impose the less profitable reproductive tasks on them, then the necessary prerequisite is a society in which the logic of exchange is overcome, and with it the discrepancy (caused by the compulsion to pursue profit) between the evaluation of “productive” and “reproductive” activities., LINE: 2598, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: moreov avoid peopl inferior order abl impos less profit reproduct task necessari prerequisit societi logic exchang overcom discrep compuls pursu profit evalu product reproduct activ
TEXT:  The word “construct” (“constructing people as inferior”) is deliberately chosen here, since from a queer feminist perspective this is about more than the mere distribution of jobs to men and women, white and black people, or Germans and migrants: in every society, what women are, what black people are etc., LINE: 2599, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: word construct peopl inferior deliber chosen sinc queer feminist perspect mere distribut job men woman white black peopl german migrant everi societi woman black peopl

TEXT:  It also means that it is not capitalism per se that causes racism, sexism etc., but that it “only” gives structural support for dividing people into identity categories. Ultimately, however, it is racist and sexist behaviors, even if they are embedded in corresponding structures, which construct these identity categories, in the process of creating or (often unconsciously) defending privileges (in what Gramsci would call the “struggle for hegemony”)., LINE: 2602, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: also mean capit per caus racism give structur support divid peopl ident categori ultim howev racist behavior even correspond structur construct ident categori process often unconsci privileg would call struggl hegemoni

TEXT:  To the extent that one does not want to be limited to the current condition of society or to earlier or elsewhere existing relations, empirical observation will not get one far. Instead, one needs a theoretical model of human behavior that makes it possible to predict behavior that can be expected under circumstances that are not observable today., LINE: 2633, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: extent one doe want limit current condit societi elsewher relat empir observ get one far instead one need theoret model human behavior make possibl predict behavior circumst observ today
TEXT:  Such a model of human behavior roughly corresponds to what is commonly known as a “view of human nature”; hence, I will make use of this somewhat more concise term. In order to make statements about human behavior in a hypothetical scenario, one thus always needs a view of human nature, if one wants to say something more than “don’t know., LINE: 2634, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: model human behavior roughli commonli known view human natur henc make use somewhat concis term order make statement human behavior hypothet scenario one thu alway need view human natur one want say someth know
TEXT: ” Two things are important here: 1.One should make one’s own view of human nature explicit, instead of simply allowing it to operate implicitly. 2.Ideally, the view of human nature on which one’s argument is based should not involve too many presuppositions., LINE: 2635, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: two thing import one make one view human natur explicit instead simpli oper implicitli ideal view human natur one argument base involv mani presupposit
TEXT:  Point (1) is important, since otherwise one leaves one’s public or interlocutor confused and frustrated. If one’s view of human nature is merely implicit, one will often get reactions like “But people are not like that” or “To do this, you first need new people, whom you have to produce by way of forced re-education., LINE: 2636, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: point import sinc otherwis one leaf one public interlocutor confus one view human natur mere implicit one often get reaction like peopl like first need new peopl produc way forc educ

TEXT:  And when one’s own view of human nature is not formulated as a mere postulate, but is justified as empirically secured knowledge, then any objections that are to be taken seriously have also to be situated on this level of theoretical justification, instead of appearing simply as counter-postulates., LINE: 2638, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: one view human natur mere postul knowledg object taken serious also situat level theoret justif instead simpli counter postul
TEXT:  Point (2) is less important, since if one has well-founded knowledge, then it makes sense to use it too.

TEXT:  The latter option offers the advantage that others can follow and accept the argument more easily, without having to evaluate the additional elements involved in the underlying view of human nature.

TEXT:  I do not want only to call for this, but also to provide it. From a feminist and anti-racist perspective, the fact that human beings are always part of their society is a platitude. For why was it so difficult in the nineteenth century to argue that women or black people are not less intelligent than white men?

TEXT:  When it is a matter of breaking up the view of human nature as being driven by egoism, this does not imply that in a “good” society, people would exclusively honor altruism and total self-sacrifice. But it obviously makes a difference whether we live in a society in which the asocial qualities receive the greatest recognition (because they represent the absolute precondition for success) or we live in a society in which these conceptualizations would be recognized as false oppositions and overcome, because only very few activities are covered by them and (re)production is accordingly organized in such a way that they have hardly any significance in day-to-day life., LINE: 2656, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: matter break view human natur driven egoism doe impli good societi peopl would exclus honor altruism total self sacrific obvious make differ whether live societi asoci qualiti receiv recognit repres absolut precondit success live societi would fals opposit overcom activ cover product accordingli organ way hardli signific day day life

TEXT:  When I use the word “identical” here, I am doing so in the Hegelian sense of the identity of identity and difference: The human being and society are identical, but also different.

TEXT:  Considered from this perspective, the idea that human beings come together to found a society is absurd.

TEXT:  Human-social existence is cooperation. Society is a cooperative set of interrelationships. Competition is a form of cooperation. Hence, the question is not whether we cooperate, but only how. And what historically specific psychological equipment we have to acquire, in order to take part in the dominant form of cooperation—hence, how we have to be able to think and feel, in order to want and be able to act—depends on this “how., LINE: 2664, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: human social exist societi set competit form henc question whether histor specif psycholog equip acquir order take part domin form henc abl think feel order want abl act

TEXT:  But this does not require us to start from the assumption that “inclusion” is true human nature. Thus, we recognize that in the question of what social relations are possible, the focus must be placed on the aspect of social structure, which predetermines the matrix for individual action—and not on assumptions about what human beings are like., LINE: 2668, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: doe requir start assumpt inclus true human natur thu recogn question social relat possibl focu must aspect social structur matrix individu action assumpt human like

TEXT:  And if I add the alleged need for “close contact,” matters become even more difficult: Why should it be so? Cannot people also exist (and be happy) without this?

TEXT:  Just as the former does not represent “human nature,” neither does the latter. But both are evidently possible.

TEXT:  Such a concept of potentiality allows us to conceive social relations “after money.” That this is challenging is obvious.

TEXT:  A “post-monetary society” that is worth striving for needs to confront a dual task: In the process of constructing a new action matrix, in which inclusive behavior is rewarded, because it works and secures one’s existence, we must change ourselves in such a way that we leave behind inherited modes of behavior and appropriate ourselves anew., LINE: 2678, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: post monetari societi worth strive need confront dual task process new action matrix inclus behavior work one exist must chang way leav behind mode behavior appropri anew
TEXT:  This is a major undertaking. But people are able to be able to do it. (4) Concept of Human Being and Social Organization Christian Siefkes Both of you say that assumptions about human beings are of limited relevance, because people, such as we are able to observe them, are always shaped by social structures and typically behave in the way that is expedient within the framework of these structures., LINE: 2679, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: major undertak peopl abl abl concept human social organ say assumpt human limit relev peopl abl observ alway shape social structur typic behav way expedi within framework structur
TEXT:  Hence, what is needed are other, better structures, in which it makes more sense to work with others instead of against them—“in which inclusive behavior is rewarded, because it works and secures one’s existence” (Stefan) and in which not “the asocial,” but rather the more social “qualities receive the greatest recognition” (Friederike)., LINE: 2680, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: henc better structur make sens work instead inclus behavior work one exist asoci rather social qualiti receiv recognit
TEXT:  I totally agree with this, but what follows from it is the crucial question: What could such structures look like and how could they function? If it is the structures that are at issue, then it is not enough to limit oneself essentially to the negation of existing structures and their functional principles., LINE: 2681, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: total agre crucial question could structur look like could function structur issu enough limit oneself essenti negat structur function principl
TEXT:  Instead, what is needed is clearly to describe the alternative structures “in which inclusive behavior is rewarded”—one cannot merely postulate this rewarding or recognition of the desired behavior, but rather one has to show how it comes about., LINE: 2682, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: instead clearli describ altern structur inclus behavior one cannot mere postul reward recognit desir behavior rather one ha show come
TEXT:  And here I find it problematic when Stefan (in his contribution to this volume) instead formulates principles that seem precisely to exclude this: for instance, that “utilizations and contributions … are [equally] socially recognized., LINE: 2683, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: find problemat contribut volum instead principl seem precis exclud instanc util contribut equal social
TEXT: ” If utilizations and contributions are equally recognized, then this suggests that no matter whether I make the bed for others or lie down in a bed that was made by others, I have in both cases rendered service to others and to society., LINE: 2684, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: util contribut equal matter whether make bed lie bed wa made case servic societi
TEXT:  No distinction should be made anymore between doing something for others and having others provide for you: none, in any case, that could reward the former and sanction or attach costs to the latter (not even when it occurs to such an extent that not enough is left over for others)., LINE: 2685, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: distinct made someth provid none case could reward former sanction attach cost latter even extent enough left
TEXT:  So, if it is not social structures that could steer behavior in the socially desirable direction, what is it then? One possible, partial answer is the reference to the variety of human interests and desires to act, which in Stefan’s contribution is called the Stigmergic Law: “Given enough people and commons, a person or commons will be found for every task that has to be done., LINE: 2686, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: social structur could steer behavior social desir direct one possibl partial answer refer varieti human interest desir act contribut law given enough peopl common person common found everi task ha done
TEXT: ” But this Stigmergic Law is in no way a law (of nature) that has been proven. It is a mere postulate. It would be more justified to formulate it as a hope: If there are numerous different tasks and numerous different people, for every task hopefully enough people can be found that have enough interest in this task to take care of it to the extent required., LINE: 2687, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: law way law natur ha proven mere postul would formul hope numer differ task numer differ peopl everi task hope enough peopl found enough interest task take care extent
TEXT:  Or maybe, instead of “that have enough interest in,” we should say rather: “that may have no interest in the task, but take it on anyway, due to their insight into what is socially necessary”? It is not clear from the original Stigmergic Law which formulation is intended, but this makes a huge difference with regard to the underlying concept of human being., LINE: 2688, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: mayb instead enough interest say rather may interest task take anyway due insight social necessari clear origin law formul intend make huge differ regard underli concept human
TEXT:  If it is a matter of interest in doing something, then what underlies this is the conception of a humanity that disposes, as a whole, over a gigantic potential for different interests and desires to act: more than enough so that for all tasks—even for those that from an individual perspective seem most boring or thankless—a sufficient number of people are available that find them highly interesting and motivating., LINE: 2689, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: matter interest someth concept human whole gigant potenti differ interest desir act enough task even individu perspect seem bore thankless suffici number peopl avail find highli interest
TEXT:  This is a beautiful vision, which is surely not entirely implausible, since the multiplicity of human interests is in fact immense. But, nonetheless, how can it be established that this multiplicity is enough not just for many, but in fact for all necessary tasks? If, on the other hand, it is a matter of insight into what is necessary, then this raises further questions in turn., LINE: 2690, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: beauti vision sure entir implaus sinc multipl human interest fact immens nonetheless establish multipl enough mani fact necessari task hand matter insight necessari rais question turn
TEXT:  Whence do all these people come that are so responsible that they make the affairs of the whole society their own and devote themselves to the necessary, but from their perspective not especially rewarding, activities that would otherwise remain undone? In order to “produce” a sufficiently large number of such responsible people, would not social indoctrination or, in other words, a program of re-education be required?

TEXT:  And would it not be rather unfair for some to toil away, in order to take care of what is socially necessary, while others only do what they want to do?

TEXT:  Due to the entirely understandable concern that, in the end, all necessary tasks would not be voluntarily performed after all, you would like to retain a structural, depersonalized form of domination of this sort (in however soft a form)., LINE: 2696, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: due entir understand concern end necessari task would voluntarili would like retain structur form domin sort howev soft form
TEXT:  Thus, you would like to “sanction or attach costs” to excessively “having others provide for you” (to a degree that is harmful to others). This is an argument that, for good reason, is well known to us from contemporary neo-liberal discourse: Extorting good behavior and sanctioning are elementary components of commodity production—as is, for instance, explained to us on a daily basis in the context of the German “Hartz 4” welfare benefit regime., LINE: 2697, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: thu would like sanction attach cost excess provid degre harm argument good reason well known contemporari neo liber discours good behavior elementari compon commod product instanc daili basi context german welfar benefit regim
TEXT:  Thus, it is no accident that you take my postulated supersession of the separation between contributions and utilizations as the starting point for the debate. It is certainly the case that one can distinguish between contributions and utilizations (although a blurring of the boundaries already occurs under our current conditions, as the phenomenon of “prosumption” shows)., LINE: 2698, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: thu accid take supersess separ contribut util start point debat certainli case one distinguish contribut util although boundari alreadi current condit phenomenon show
TEXT:  But it is only commodity production that first made this into a separation and opposition whose poles obey different action rationalities, which from now on always appear as linked: Without a contribution, no use; without money, no commodity for satisfying a need., LINE: 2699, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: commod product first made separ opposit whose pole obey differ action ration alway appear link without contribut use without money commod satisfi need
TEXT:  But this means that, vice-versa, a supersession of linked negative reciprocity (which is the social form of exchange) necessarily involves no longer distinguishing between contributions which count as such and “merely” useful contributions., LINE: 2700, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: mean vice supersess link neg reciproc social form exchang necessarili longer distinguish contribut count mere use contribut
TEXT:  Also because it is, from my perspective, unjustifiable (even just partially) to exclude those people who are able to contribute little or nothing from the full use of total social wealth.

TEXT:  From my point of view, the paradigm shift that has to be accomplished can be described as follows: The question is not how do I get people to do this or that—I call this a “really-existing socialist” style of thinking, which has not freed itself from the extortionist logic of the commodity form—but rather under what conditions do people, for good reasons, act and organize themselves in such a way that no one loses out., LINE: 2703, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: point view paradigm shift ha accomplish question get peopl call realli socialist style think ha freed extortionist logic commod form rather condit peopl good reason act organ way one

TEXT:  I provide an experimental description of how this can occur on the categorial level in my contribution to this book. Stigmergy plays a key role in the mediation here. But mediation implies that there can be no steering of the process in accordance with external standards (like in the case of the commodity, whereby the ability to valorize serves as external standard), but rather stigmergy is a means for self-organization and self-planning., LINE: 2705, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: provid experiment descript occur categori level contribut book play key role mediat mediat steer process accord extern standard like case commod wherebi abil valor serf extern standard rather mean self organ self
TEXT:  To demand of me that I justify how self-organization can ultimately accomplish “all necessary tasks” is internally contradictory.

Stefan, concerning Gabor Maté’s statement (“We have a human need for companionship and for close contact, to be loved, to be attached to, to be accepted, to be seen, to be received for who we are”), you write: “The usual dichotomization appears in the postulated ‘need for companionship’: I have a need for something that I am not., LINE: 2713, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: doe foster commun concern mate statement human need companionship close contact attach accept seen receiv write usual dichotom need companionship need someth

TEXT:  Which, then, is the focus of your further discussion. Not only are we, as people, part of our society, but so too are our categories of thought. This too is a commonplace in feminist writings.

TEXT:  And in the case of exchange, you say explicitly that you regard it as a “form of reciprocal extortion” and hence cannot accept it as “foundation for human interrelationships.” But at least as regards exchange, the picture is skewed, since extortion requires an active role: I threaten someone else with negative consequences, in case he or she fails to meet my demands., LINE: 2730, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: case exchang say explicitli regard form reciproc extort henc cannot accept foundat human least regard exchang pictur skew sinc extort activ role threaten someon els neg consequ case meet demand

TEXT:  It seems to me that an ethically emotionalized fallacy is involved here: Since A (extortion) is evil, both B (sanctions) and C (exchange) are also evil, and hence a better society must forgo all three and be organized “beyond exchange, extortion and sanctions., LINE: 2732, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: ethic fallaci involv sinc extort evil sanction exchang also evil henc better societi must forgo three organ beyond exchang extort sanction

TEXT:  This means that, vice-versa, where exchange transactions work well for the participants, there is nothing to be said against them. This is why for me the question concerning “How will it work then?” is so important, whereas both of you tend to dismiss it with a “we will find out., LINE: 2734, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: mean vice exchang transact work well particip noth said question concern work import wherea tend dismiss find
TEXT: ” For me, it is by no means sure whether a society in which neither people nor nature lose out must or even could entirely do without exchange. This has rather to be made plausible, and the problem is not resolved simply be saying “creative energy will, then, flow into doing so” (Stefan) or “then we will see” (Friederike)., LINE: 2735, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: mean sure whether societi neither peopl natur lose must even could entir without exchang ha rather made plausibl problem resolv simpli say creativ energi flow see

TEXT:  But your claim sounds more general: Every sort of sanction is to be rejected. You thus distance yourself from the findings of commons research, in which “graduated sanctions” figure as one of the essential conditions for successful commons: “Sanctions for rule violations start very low but become stronger if a user repeatedly violates a rule” (Ostrom 2009)., LINE: 2737, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: claim sound gener everi sort sanction thu distanc find common research graduat sanction figur one essenti condit success common sanction rule violat start low becom user repeatedli rule
TEXT:  Unnecessarily harsh sanctions are counter-productive—but it is not possible either to do entirely without. The findings of commons theory also include the fact that commons always need rules: “No commons can function without rules that have been agreed upon” (Commons-Institut 2017)., LINE: 2738, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: unnecessarili harsh sanction counter product possibl either entir without find common theori also includ fact common alway need rule common function without rule agre upon common

TEXT:  But this can only be shown in practice, it cannot be theoretically postulated in advance.

TEXT:  As true as this is, I do not find it very convincing when it comes to the organization of society as a whole. Society cannot be grasped on the model of a nuclear family. And even the example of the mother is not self-evident and hence universally human: In earlier times, rather than the mother, often a (paid) wet nurse was responsible for feeding children in well-to-do families., LINE: 2742, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: true find convinc come organ societi whole societi cannot model nuclear famili even exampl mother self evid henc univers human time rather mother often wet nurs wa respons feed child well famili

TEXT:  This little example already makes clear that the seemingly self-evident is anything but self-evident.

TEXT: ) One of the key questions that I posed in my book From Exchange to Contributions was “How to coordinate the producer side … with the consumer side?” (Siefkes 2008: 17). It is possible that findings deriving from the view of human nature, or concept of human being, could allay the fear that in a production-driven society (in which potential producers decide how and where to get involved as they see fit), the consumer perspective would be neglected (because consumers cannot do anything more than to provide indications of their needs and wishes and then to hope for the best)., LINE: 2749, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: one key question book exchang contribut wa produc side consum side possibl find view human natur concept human could allay fear product driven societi potenti produc decid get involv see fit consum perspect would consum cannot anyth provid indic need wish hope best

TEXT:  But such a purely interpersonal view obscures the structural conditions that first create the superficial appearance of good functioning: The producer has succeeded in producing the commodity at the market value and the buyer has succeeded in obtaining money, in order to be able to buy the commodity—and in both cases, structurally at the expense of, for the most part, invisible others (say, the Indian farmers who kill themselves or the indigent who have to hold out their hands to get a meal)., LINE: 2761, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: pure interperson view structur condit first creat superfici appear good produc ha commod market valu buyer ha money order abl buy commod case structur expens part invis say farmer kill indig hold hand get meal
TEXT:  Although it appears interpersonal, the situation of extortion is thus, in fact, a structural situation of compulsion, which first makes the extortionist action functional and also necessary. The sellers cannot give away the commodity and the buyers cannot simply take the commodity either, even if it is available in abundance, since both sorts of behavior are structurally sanctioned (as bankruptcy or legal penalty)., LINE: 2762, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: although interperson situat extort thu fact structur situat compuls first make extortionist action function also necessari seller cannot give away commod buyer cannot simpli take commod either even avail abund sinc sort behavior structur bankruptci legal penalti

TEXT:  But I respond structurally and say that it is not possible to say in advance how people will concretely behave. You are looking for the answer where it is not to be found. But then, nonetheless, you come to the conclusion—by way of a kind of fallacy of immediacy—that from your perspective it is inexplicable why people should behave differently than they do today, for which reason one has ultimately to compel them to do so., LINE: 2764, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: respond structur say possibl say advanc peopl concret behav look answer found nonetheless come conclus way kind fallaci immediaci perspect inexplic peopl behav differ today reason one ha ultim compel
TEXT:  My argument, on the other hand, is essentially that what matters is creating relations in which there are good reasons for people to behave differently: no longer at the expense of others, etc. From this average structural point of view, I cannot, in fact, guarantee that socially destructive behavior will not also occur., LINE: 2765, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: argument hand essenti matter relat good reason peopl behav differ longer expens averag structur point view cannot fact guarante social destruct behavior also occur

TEXT:  There is not anything that depends on them: neither for the individual nor for society. The structure-neutral, interpersonal view is repeated in the discussion of the results of commons research. The necessity of sanctions that Ostrom generally noted for existing commons refers to relations in which it is altogether functional to exploit individual commons: for instance, to take material resources or products from them, contrary to the rules, in order to pocket an extra profit by selling them externally., LINE: 2768, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: anyth neither individu societi structur neutral interperson view repeat discuss result common research necess sanction gener note common relat altogeth function exploit individu common instanc take materi resourc product contrari rule order pocket extra profit sell extern

TEXT:  “logic of exclusion”). If there is no such “external” countervailing destructive logic, then the essential grounds for action threatening the commons are removed.

TEXT:  But this is part of the conflict resolution that, from my point of view, will acquire considerably greater significance as compared to today.

TEXT:  Exchange, extortion and sanctions are to be abolished as structural relations and to be brought back as conflict resolution in the interpersonal domain.

But once I bring also my favorite activities onto the market—and possibly have to learn that they are “of no value” in the competition with other activities—can I really, then, still take pleasure in contributing them? Or if, on the contrary, I see that my activities are treated as valuable, perhaps because others cannot replace them, will I not, then, start to hold back on them, instead of taking pleasure in my contributions? You already called attention to one aspect, Stefan, but it is so important to me that I would like briefly to repeat it: Currently, thousands upon thousands are starving around the world, precisely because they have nothing to exchange., LINE: 2783, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: cours never case activ popular bring also favorit activ onto market possibl learn valu competit activ realli still take pleasur contrari see activ valuabl perhap cannot replac start hold back instead take pleasur contribut alreadi attent one aspect import would like briefli repeat current thousand upon thousand around world precis noth exchang

TEXT:  Ostrom 1990: 59). In other words, following the rules was economically irrational despite the sanctions. Nonetheless, they were hardly violated. So, what is the use of the sanctions?

TEXT:  Or as I put it, they serve to demarcate a domain of self-evidence.

TEXT:  Some economists call for the taming of finance capital, such that real capital acquires greater influence; others are for the introduction of an unconditional basic income. In this contribution, by contrast, we will not be searching for proposed cures to the sickness of capitalism, but rather we will be on the look-out for empirically-measurable tendencies that are driving the capitalist system to its end., LINE: 2816, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: economist call financ capit real capit greater influenc introduct uncondit basic incom contribut contrast search cure sick capit rather look measur tendenc drive capitalist system end
TEXT:  The contribution is inspired by the “Fragment on Machines” from Karl Marx’s Grundrisse, in which Marx anticipates the breakdown of “production based on exchange value” and hence of capitalism.

TEXT:  The “computer socialism” of Cockshott and Cottrell (1993) also draws on detailed input-output tables. It is presented as an example for a subjective form of transcending capitalism.

TEXT:  Since, however, the latter do not create any value, their expansion signifies a tendency to transcend value and, thereby, surplus-value, profit, and money. 1. Promises More than two thousand years ago, Aristotle already described his dream of the end of slaveholder society: Tools may be animate as well as inanimate; for instance, a ship’s captain uses a lifeless rudder, but a living man for watch … So any piece of property can be regarded as a tool enabling a man to live, and his property is an assemblage of such tools; a slave is a sort of living piece of property; and like any other servant is a tool in charge of other tools., LINE: 2822, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: sinc howev latter creat valu expans tendenc transcend valu therebi surplu valu profit money promis two thousand year ago alreadi dream end slavehold societi tool may anim well inanim instanc ship captain us lifeless rudder live man watch piec properti tool man live properti assemblag tool slave sort live piec properti like servant tool charg tool
TEXT:  For suppose that every tool we had could perform its task, either at our bidding or itself perceiving the need, and if—like the statues made by Daedalus or the tripods of Hephaestus, of which the poet says that “self-moved they enter the assembly of the gods”—shuttles in a loom could fly to and fro and a plucker play a lyre of their own accord, then master-craftsmen would have no need of servants nor masters of slaves., LINE: 2823, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: suppos everi tool could perform task either bid perceiv need like statu made tripod poet say self enter assembl god shuttl loom could fli fro plucker play lyre accord master craftsman would need servant master slave
TEXT:  Aristotle, Politics, I, iv, 1253b1 Karl Marx took up this dream, concretized it and modernized it, and he thereby gave a new perspective to economics: But to the degree that large industry develops, the creation of real wealth comes to depend less on labor time and on the amount of labor employed than … on the general state of science and on the progress of technology, or the application of this science to production … With that, production based on exchange value breaks down … The measure of wealth is then not any longer, in any way, labor time, but rather disposable time., LINE: 2824, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: polit took dream therebi gave new perspect econom degre larg industri creation real wealth come depend less labor time amount labor employ gener state scienc progress technolog applic scienc product product base exchang valu break measur wealth longer way labor time rather dispos time
TEXT:  Marx 1973: 704ff. This breakdown would signify the end of capitalism—at least of capitalism as we know it. All the elements and forms of appearance of exchange-value would be dissolved, if the creation of wealth is no longer based on wage-labor: surplus-value, surplus product, profit, commodity production, capitalist accumulation, exploitation, and alienation., LINE: 2825, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: breakdown would signifi end capit least capit know element form appear exchang valu would creation wealth longer base wage labor surplu valu surplu product profit commod product capitalist accumul exploit alien
TEXT:  Money would lose the functions it hitherto discharged as scarcity indicator and as the key to wealth. Thanks to this text,2 economics was given a new purpose—though it largely failed to notice it. It was no longer supposed to deal, like the economic theories that hitherto existed, with the “optimal allocation of scarce resources,” but rather with the question of the further development of capitalism and the transition to an economy that will come after it., LINE: 2826, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: money would lose function hitherto scarciti indic key wealth thank text econom wa given new purpos though larg notic wa longer suppos deal like econom theori hitherto optim alloc scarc resourc rather question develop capit transit economi come
TEXT:  Here is Marx on the subject: “It must be kept in mind that the new forces of production and relations of production do not develop out of nothing, nor drop from the sky, nor from the womb of the self-positing Idea; but from within and in antithesis to the existing development of production and the inherited, traditional relations of property” (Marx 1973: 278)., LINE: 2827, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: subject must kept mind new forc product relat product develop noth drop sky womb self idea within antithesi develop product tradit relat properti
TEXT:  This process is characterized by contradictions that cannot be resolved within capitalism: “Capitalist production, therefore, only develops the techniques and the degree of combination of the social process of production by simultaneously undermining the original sources of all wealth—the soil and the worker” (Marx 1976: 638)., LINE: 2828, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: process contradict cannot resolv within capit capitalist product therefor techniqu degre combin social process product simultan undermin origin sourc wealth soil worker

TEXT:  The present author follows Marx’s indication concerning the breakdown of production based on exchange-value in two respects: On the one hand, technology or the application of science in production is considered in its concrete forms; on the other hand, the creation of value, surplus-value and surplus product within the framework of contemporary capitalist society is investigated in detail., LINE: 2830, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: present author indic concern breakdown product base exchang valu two respect one hand technolog applic scienc product consid concret form hand creation valu surplu valu surplu product within framework contemporari capitalist societi detail
TEXT:  It will be shown here that the extent of service production plays an essential role.

TEXT:  In their political writings, Marx and Engels did not leave matters to an automatic mechanism, but rather were actively committed to the conquest of power by the expanding proletariat. Before going on to indicate the concrete steps underlying the politics of communist parties, they write in The Communist Manifesto: “The proletariat will use its political supremacy to wrest, by degree, all capital from the bourgeoisie, to centralise all instruments of production in the hands of the State, i., LINE: 2832, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: polit write leav matter automat mechan rather activ conquest power expand proletariat go indic concret step underli polit communist parti write communist manifesto proletariat use polit supremaci wrest degre capit bourgeoisi instrument product hand state

On the author’s view, these positions are not opposed to one another, but rather the latter is a necessary complement to the former: If they are not to remain in vain, the subjective efforts to overcome capitalism have to be supported by an objective tendency toward its formal end., LINE: 2833, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: proletariat rule class increas total product forc rapidli possibl author view posit oppos one anoth rather latter necessari complement former remain vain subject effort overcom capit object tendenc toward formal end
TEXT:  2. Motor Productive Forces Technology is one of the key parameters for both qualitative and quantitative changes in production. Through it, society regulates its metabolic relationship with nature. Technology is a component of the “productive forces” of human beings, which can be defined, in general, as a “system of interaction between material-objective and human-subjective elements” (Klaus and Buhr 1972: 879)., LINE: 2834, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: motor product forc technolog one key paramet qualit quantit chang product societi metabol relationship natur technolog compon product forc human defin gener system interact materi object human subject element buhr

TEXT:  A historical trend toward human beings using nature more efficiently thereby becomes apparent in both qualitative and quantitative terms. 2.1 Industrial Revolution Whereas human beings separated themselves from the animal world by production and the habitual use of tools and supplemented their natural endowments by using artifacts, after slave-holding society and feudalism, large-scale industry developed in Europe in the nineteenth century by way of the precursors of manufacturing., LINE: 2836, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: histor trend toward human natur effici therebi becom appar qualit quantit term industri revolut wherea human anim world product habitu use tool natur endow artifact slave hold societi feudal larg scale industri nineteenth centuri way precursor

TEXT:  The mechanical machine (as a labor or tool machine) and, later, a whole system of machines gradually replaced human labor functions (drive energy, transmission of energy to the tool, guiding the tool) by technical mechanisms and partly made the use of human labor power superfluous., LINE: 2838, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: mechan machin labor tool machin later whole system machin gradual human labor function drive energi transmiss energi tool tool technic mechan partli made use human labor power superflu
TEXT:  The consequence under capitalist conditions was an army of unemployed people in the cities. 2.2 Scientific-Technical Revolution In the twentieth century, the industrial revolution was succeeded by the scientific-technical revolution (Bernal 1957: 960), which began with groundbreaking scientific discoveries in the natural sciences., LINE: 2839, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: consequ capitalist condit wa armi unemploy peopl citi scientif technic revolut twentieth centuri industri revolut wa scientif technic revolut scientif discoveri natur scienc
TEXT:  “Information processing machinery” (IPM) can be described as the development-leading machinery of the present day. Since the middle of the twentieth century, such machinery has gone through various stages of technical realization: from relay circuits by way of electron tubes and semiconductors, from transistors to error-free integrated circuits., LINE: 2840, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: inform machineri develop lead machineri present day sinc middl twentieth centuri machineri ha gone variou stage technic realiz relay circuit way electron tube semiconductor transistor error free circuit
TEXT:  IPM is characterized by three sub-functions that can assume human labor (sub-)functions: (1) the sensor, (2) an information processing apparatus and (3) the actuator or effector (Adler 1978: 41; Fleissner 1985: 162ff., LINE: 2841, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: three sub function assum human labor sub function sensor inform apparatu actuat effector
TEXT: ). The ability of human sense organs to ascertain conditions and changes in matter are embodied in the sensor. Indeed, it can even “perceive” processes that would be too subtle for human organs or for which there is no natural organ at all: like, for example, electromagnetic waves., LINE: 2842, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: abil human sens organ ascertain condit chang matter sensor inde even perceiv process would subtl human organ natur organ like exampl electromagnet wave
TEXT:  The apparatus for processing information picks up the signals of the sensor and reacts to them in pre-programmed fashion. It imitates human decision-making processes in more or less complex ways. The outcome of the decision, finally, steers the actuator, which is responsible for the external effect., LINE: 2843, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: apparatu inform pick signal sensor fashion human decis make process less complex way outcom decis final steer actuat respons extern effect
TEXT:  Every laptop computer and every mobile phone is an expression of this technical innovation. If you connect IPM to a mechanical machine, what you get is an automaton (Figure 6). Thanks to its programming, the IPM “observes” the functions of the mechanical machine; by way of the actuator, the production process can be influenced or optimized., LINE: 2844, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: everi comput everi mobil phone express technic innov connect mechan machin get automaton figur thank function mechan machin way actuat product process

TEXT:  Once adopted into the production process of capital, the means of labor passes through different metamorphoses, whose culmination is the machine, or rather, an automatic system of machinery (system of machinery: the automatic one is merely its most complete, most adequate form, and alone transforms machinery into a system), set in motion by an automaton, a moving power that moves itself; this automaton consisting of numerous mechanical and intellectual organs, so that the workers themselves are cast merely as its conscious linkages., LINE: 2847, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: adopt product process capit mean labor pass differ metamorphosi whose culmin machin rather automat system machineri system machineri automat one mere complet adequ form alon machineri system set motion automaton move power move automaton numer mechan intellectu organ worker cast mere consciou linkag

TEXT:  In this way, a new technology gets quickly disseminated in companies and, as a result, labor productivity increases.3 What result is to be expected? It is contradictory.

TEXT:  On the other hand, the time that people spend doing wage labor will decline. But this is not yet—as Marx hoped it would be—a blessing, but rather, in the form of unemployment, a curse.

By way of the detour of programs that are used in three-dimensional printers, this glut can also be extended to material goods (if sooner or later the question of energy and resources has also to be posed): Using 3D-printers, it is already possible today to produce a car from plastic parts in a week., LINE: 2861, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: inform good therebi becom good like commod even though unlik commod disappear rather way detour program use three dimension printer glut also extend materi good sooner later question energi resourc ha also printer alreadi possibl today produc car plastic part week

TEXT:  The labor-saving methods will prevail generally and, little by little, take over the whole economy, as a result of which profits will ultimately decline.

TEXT:  Hence, the first step that the author will undertake here is marked by a presentation of the theory of value:6 not just verbally, however, but in the notation of matrices and vectors that make it possible to extend Marx’s value theory and to undertake empirical testing of his theses using contemporary economic statistics., LINE: 2870, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: henc first step author undertak mark present theori valu verbal howev notat matrix vector make possibl extend valu theori undertak empir test thesi contemporari econom statist
TEXT:  3.1 Input-Output Analysis We need at this point to make a short digression on input-output analysis, which, in its mathematized form, allows for a condensed expression of complex relationships. We will be drawing, above all, on the work of the 1973 Nobel Prize winner in economics, Wassily Leontief (1986)., LINE: 2871, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: input output analysi need point make short digress input output analysi form condens express complex relationship draw work prize winner econom
TEXT:  His input-output analysis can, to a large extent, be combined with Marxian reflections. The mathematical representation of an economy, following Leontief, allows for the use of matrix equations. With their help, the Marxian simple and expanded reproduction schemes, as described in volume 2 of Capital, can be extended to as many economic sectors as one likes., LINE: 2872, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: input output analysi larg extent combin reflect mathemat represent economi follow use matrix equat help simpl expand reproduct scheme volum capit extend mani econom sector one like
TEXT:  Moreover, a computer can be used to help with the calculations, since effective programs for calculation with matrices and vectors are available. At the same time, thus modified, input-output analysis provides a bridge to empirical testing of the Marxian theses on value theory in capitalist economies., LINE: 2873, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: moreov comput use help calcul sinc effect program calcul matrix vector avail time thu input output analysi bridg empir test thesi valu theori capitalist economi
TEXT:  In most of the countries on earth, namely, annual or even quarterly input-output tables are published, which describe their economies and which permit us also statistically to test the Marxian concepts using concrete data., LINE: 2874, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: countri earth name annual even quarterli input output tabl describ economi permit also statist test concept concret data
TEXT:  Input-output analysis shows the interdependencies of an economy on the level of economic sectors or industries and answers the questions: “What industry supplies goods to what industry in what quantity?” and “What goods are acquired in what quantity for producing the goods of an industry?” Input-output analysis corresponds to the Marxian concepts of use-value and exchange-value., LINE: 2875, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: input output analysi show economi level econom sector industri answer question industri suppli good industri quantiti good acquir quantiti good industri input output analysi concept use valu exchang valu
TEXT:  The duality of the commodity, which is already emphasized at the beginning of the first volume of Capital, is thematized in Leontief’s input-output analysis as “primal” and “dual” problem.7 The primal problem deals with use-values (measured in quantities or units of measurement or weight, e., LINE: 2876, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: dualiti commod alreadi begin first volum capit input output analysi primal dual problem primal problem deal use valu measur quantiti unit measur weight
TEXT: g. per year), whereas the dual problem corresponds to Marx’s preferred value analysis (measured in units of money). The primal problem expresses the use of output quantities x as inputs Ax or as final demand y; in matrix notation:8 Ax + y = x (1) Ax, x and y are vectors: hence (vertical) arrangements of m numbers., LINE: 2877, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: per year wherea dual problem prefer valu analysi measur unit money primal problem express use output quantiti input final demand matrix notat vector henc vertic arrang number
TEXT:  Here, m is the number of different goods in an economy. Using vectors and matrices in their two-dimensional form, relatively complex arithmetic operations—such as the addition, subtraction or multiplication of many numbers—can be written in a simple formula., LINE: 2878, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: number differ good economi vector matrix two dimension form rel complex arithmet oper addit subtract multipl mani number written simpl formula
TEXT:  Matrix A can serve as an example. Matrix A is a quadratic matrix, since it has m rows and m columns. To make this clearer, you can think of an arrangement of numbers on the fields of a chessboard. At the points of intersection between the (horizontal) rows and (vertical) columns, it contains the m2 “technical coefficients,” aij, of an economy., LINE: 2879, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: matrix serv exampl matrix quadrat matrix sinc ha row column make clearer think arrang number field chessboard point intersect horizont row vertic column technic coeffici economi
TEXT:  An element aij of the matrix A is located at the point of intersection of its ith row and jth column. It shows how many units of the good with the index i are need to produce one unit of the good with the index j., LINE: 2880, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: element matrix point intersect row column show mani unit good index need produc one unit good index
TEXT:  The elements of matrix A allow us to compare economies of different countries or, for a given economy, to identify and evaluate quantitative changes over time. In the case of technological changes allowing for major savings in materials or energy, they will become smaller., LINE: 2881, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: element matrix allow compar economi differ countri given economi identifi evalu quantit chang time case technolog chang major save materi energi becom smaller
TEXT:  The dual problem considers unit price p as the sum of the unit costs of the inputs required for the production of one unit pA plus the value-created per unit, q; hence: pA + q = p (2) pA, p and q are (horizontal) arrangements of m numbers., LINE: 2882, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: dual problem unit price sum unit cost input product one unit plu valu per unit henc horizont arrang number
TEXT:  The elements of these vectors are expressed in currency units. The sales that take place in an economy are the result of the element by element multiplication of unit price times quantity.

TEXT:  On the one hand, they have a use-value, which makes them a useful object. When they can be sold on the market for money, on the other hand, they possess an exchange-value.

TEXT:  What is behind exchange-value, in qualitative terms, is human labor and this human labor is measured in labor-time. In market economies, in addition to particular commodities, money appears as the general commodity., LINE: 2886, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: behind exchang valu qualit term human labor human labor measur labor time market economi addit particular commod money gener commod
TEXT:  Money can be exchanged against every particular commodity, since a unit of money always expresses a certain amount of labor-time. If one carefully reads the first section of Capital, it becomes apparent that the concept of the commodity is principally tailored to reproducible physical products., LINE: 2887, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: money everi particular commod sinc unit money alway express certain amount labor time one care read first section capit becom appar concept commod princip reproduc physic product
TEXT:  Marx regards the value of a commodity as a social relation between human beings that is expressed on the surface as a quantitative relation between things: The value of the commodity “appears first of all as the quantitative relation, the proportion, in which use-values of one kind exchange for use-values of another kind., LINE: 2888, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: regard valu commod social relat human express surfac quantit relat thing valu commod first quantit relat proport use valu one kind exchang use valu anoth kind
TEXT:  This relation changes constantly with time and place” (Marx 1976: 126). By way of abstraction, Marx shows that the magnitude of value of a commodity is determined, more precisely, by the “the amount of labor socially necessary, or the labor time socially necessary for its production” (Marx 1976: 129)., LINE: 2889, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: relat chang constantli time place way abstract show magnitud valu commod determin precis amount labor social necessari labor time social necessari product
TEXT:  Stripped of its market-mediated shell, the existence of commodities signifies that human beings work for one another, inasmuch as they produce goods that they exchange as needed via the mediation of money., LINE: 2890, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: strip market shell exist commod human work one anoth inasmuch produc good exchang via mediat money
TEXT:  Thereby, the concrete interrelation and interdependence of human beings—or, in other words, their sociality—gets expressed in a specific, viz. reified, form. Or, to cite Galiani per Marx, “Value is a relation between persons,” to which Marx adds: “a relation concealed beneath a material shell” (Marx 1976: 167, footnote)., LINE: 2891, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: therebi concret interrel interdepend human word social get express specif form cite per valu relat person add relat conceal beneath materi shell footnot
TEXT:  3.3 Abstract Representation of an Economy: Value Creation In the first volume of Capital, Marx describes an abstract economy consisting of small commodity producers who compete with one another by way of markets., LINE: 2892, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: abstract represent economi valu creation first volum capit abstract economi small commod produc compet one anoth way market
TEXT:  He investigates how the (exchange-)values of commodities come into being. These correspond to the direct and indirect amount of average socially necessary labor required for the production of a good. A value is thus composed of two components: of living labor and of the labor that is objectified in the inputs and that is transferred to the commodity., LINE: 2893, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: exchang valu commod come correspond direct indirect amount averag social necessari labor product good valu thu compos two compon live labor labor input transfer commod
TEXT:  On this abstract level of presentation, Marx focuses on the essence of a market economy: on the production of commodities and hence of value through labor. Physics, whose laws are initially also formulated on an abstract level, chooses the same scientific procedure., LINE: 2894, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: abstract level present focu essenc market economi product commod henc valu labor physic whose law initi also abstract level scientif procedur
TEXT:  Thus, for example, the Newtonian law says: “All bodies fall at the same speed”—a claim that is constantly being empirically contradicted. A feather and a metal ball obviously do not fall at the same speed., LINE: 2895, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: thu exampl law say bodi fall speed claim constantli feather metal ball obvious fall speed
TEXT:  It is only additional theories based on a more concrete view of things, like fluid mechanics, that allow us to explain the difference in the speed at which objects fall. It is similar in the case of value theory., LINE: 2896, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: addit theori base concret view thing like fluid mechan allow explain differ speed object fall similar case valu theori
TEXT:  Only the introduction of additional mechanisms makes possible a better understanding of the observable price structure on the surface of appearances: for instance, in competitive capitalism. Input-output analysis allows us also mathematically to grasp the creation of value and later value modifications in individual stages of concretization., LINE: 2897, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: introduct addit mechan make possibl better understand observ price structur surfac appear instanc competit capit input output analysi also mathemat grasp creation valu later valu modif individu stage
TEXT:  We can thus take the scientific path that Marx proposed of moving from the abstract to the concrete. After having presented the basic features of input-output analysis in a first step, we can now interpret such analysis in the spirit of Marxian value theory., LINE: 2898, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: thu take scientif path move abstract concret basic featur input output analysi first step interpret analysi spirit valu theori
TEXT:  The point of departure here is equation (2), Leontief’s dual problem, which defines unit prices. If instead of the value created per unit, q, the living labor per unit, n, is used in the formula, the unit values, w, of commodities from the equation wA + n = w (3) can be determined as w = n (E-A)−1 (4) n symbolizes the row vector of living labor-time per unit; A, as above, is the matrix of technical coefficients., LINE: 2899, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: point departur equat dual problem unit price instead valu per unit live labor per unit use formula unit valu commod equat determin row vector live labor time per unit matrix technic coeffici
TEXT:  E stands for the unit matrix, which only contains ones in the main diagonal and, otherwise, nothing but zeros, and (E-A)−1 stands for the Leontief inverse, which any laptop computer can calculate.

TEXT: ” As can be seen in equation (3), the labor-values are composed of the labor-time contained in the inputs (already performed labor or, in Marxian terminology, constant capital c) and the newly added living labor., LINE: 2901, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: seen equat labor valu compos labor time input alreadi labor terminolog constant capit newli ad live labor
TEXT:  Equations (3) and (4) describe the creation of values in an economy. These values will in general deviate from the prices that are empirically present. In capitalism, the newly added living labor is the point of departure for the division into a wage share and a profit share (in Marxian terminology, variable capital v and surplus value s)., LINE: 2902, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: equat describ creation valu economi valu gener deviat price present capit newli ad live labor point departur divis wage share profit share terminolog variabl capit surplu valu
TEXT:  Marx thus obtained the famous value composition equation: value = c + v + s (5) Technological changes are reflected in this model in two ways: On the one hand, living labor will fall in an industry in which labor-saving machines are being used; on the other hand, material-saving and energy-saving changes will get expressed in smaller aij coefficients., LINE: 2903, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: thu famou valu composit equat valu technolog chang reflect model two way one hand live labor fall industri labor save machin use hand materi save energi save chang get express smaller coeffici
TEXT:  As can be mathematically demonstrated, in both cases, the labor-values will become smaller. We thus obtain a conclusion that has importance for the further discussion: Labor-values per unit decrease with the use of labor-saving, material-saving and energy-saving changes., LINE: 2904, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: mathemat case labor valu becom smaller thu obtain conclus ha import discuss labor valu per unit decreas use labor save materi save energi save chang
TEXT:  Up to this point, Marxist political economists will largely agree with the above summary of the Marxian theory. The same cannot always be said for the following section. 4. Commodities and Services While analyzing the activities of an economy more precisely, Marx asked himself the following rhetorical question: Are there not at every moment of time in the market, alongside wheat and meat, etc., LINE: 2905, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: point polit economist larg agre summari theori cannot alway said follow section commod servic activ economi precis follow rhetor question everi moment time market alongsid wheat meat

TEXT:  Reckoned as consumable articles, there is at every moment of time, alongside the consumable articles existing in the form of goods, a quantity of consumable articles in the form of services. Marx 1963: 168 What role do these services play in the theory of value? In recent decades, it has become ever more important to answer this question, since services (both personal and economic services) already represent two-thirds to three-quarters of gross domestic product in the EU., LINE: 2907, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: consum articl everi moment time alongsid consum articl form good quantiti consum articl form servic role servic play theori valu recent decad ha becom ever import answer question sinc servic person econom servic alreadi repres two third three quarter gross domest product
TEXT:  Our current society is hence described by some as a “service society.” 4.1 Characteristics of Services Drawing on the above Marx quote, the author has formulated the following characteristics of services in the calculation of value., LINE: 2908, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: current societi henc servic societi characterist servic draw quot author ha follow characterist servic calcul valu
TEXT:  These observations are only valid on the abstract level of the creation of value: 1.Although, as a rule, services possess no material form, they have a use-value.

TEXT:  2.As such, a service can neither be re-sold nor stored or accumulated, since it is consumed (e.g. the hearing of a concert or a transport service provided by a taxi). 3.A service makes no direct contribution either to the economic surplus product or to surplus-value., LINE: 2910, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: servic neither sold sinc hear concert transport servic provid taxi servic make direct contribut either econom surplu product surplu valu
TEXT:  4.Due to their production costs, services possess an exchange-value on the abstract level of value creation.

TEXT:  In the case of services, however, a surplus-value as a component of living labor does not exist, nor does a surplus product.

TEXT:  4.2 Exchange of Equivalents The above-mentioned assumptions ensure that exchange of equivalents is present: i.e. that on the abstract level, a commodity can be “fairly” exchanged for another commodity (without one of the partners in the exchange taking advantage of the other)., LINE: 2913, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: exchang equival assumpt ensur exchang equival present abstract level commod fairli anoth commod without one partner exchang take advantag

TEXT:  The first chapters of Capital examine the capitalist economy on the following presupposition: “The value of a commodity is related to the value of any other commodity as the labor-time necessary for the production of the one is related to the labor-time necessary for the production of the other” (Marx 1976: 130)., LINE: 2915, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: first chapter capit examin capitalist economi follow presupposit valu commod relat valu commod labor time necessari product one relat labor time necessari product

TEXT:  4.3 Value Modifications In the third volume of Capital, Marx shows, among other things, that the exchange of equivalents, which for small commodity producers still had its justification on the abstract level, no longer applies with the transition to capitalism., LINE: 2917, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: valu modif third volum capit show among thing exchang equival small commod produc still justif abstract level longer transit capit
TEXT:  The hunt for maximum profit rates leads to the shifting of constant capital into those branches that promise higher profits than one’s own industry. The values of commodities now no longer follow the amount of labor-time expended, but rather are transformed into prices of production, which, in ideal-typical terms, are determined (also, of course, for services) by the application of the average rate of profit to the cost price (Marx 1981: 264ff., LINE: 2918, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: hunt maximum profit rate lead shift constant capit branch promis higher profit one industri valu commod longer follow amount labor time rather price product ideal typic term determin also cours servic applic averag rate profit cost price
TEXT: ). Under the heading of the “transformation problem,” this step of concretization has been debated for over a hundred years.

TEXT:  Other value modifications come into play when taking into account finance capital (by way of credit and interest), the state (by way of taxes, subsidies, and social benefits), and, finally, in contemporary information society, by way of the commodification of information goods and the commercialization of information services (Figure 7)., LINE: 2920, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: valu modif come play take account financ capit way credit interest state way tax subsidi social benefit final contemporari inform societi way inform good inform servic figur

TEXT:  In this connection, the question arises of what variables actually bring about the different value modifications in the Leontief model. In a closed economy with several sectors, but without foreign trade and without money, an easy answer can be given: It depends on how the surplus product is distributed among the different economic branches., LINE: 2922, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: connect question variabl actual bring differ valu modif model close economi sever sector without foreign trade without money easi answer given surplu product distribut among differ econom branch
TEXT:  If the economy is to remain in equilibrium (such that all markets can be cleared), the respective unit prices will have to change. With constant technical conditions (the same technical coefficients and the same productivity of labor) and the same consumption by wage-earners, all possible value modifications (and hence too the prices proportional to the value modifications) can be generated by way of different allocations of the surplus product., LINE: 2923, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: economi remain equilibrium market respect unit price chang constant technic condit technic coeffici product labor consumpt wage earner possibl valu modif henc price proport valu modif way differ alloc surplu product

TEXT:  For Marx, who was looking to discover the laws of motion of capitalism, two different definitions of productive labor are conflated in Smith. He only treats the first one as correct: “Only labor which produces capital is productive labor” (Marx 1963: 156)., LINE: 2926, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: wa look discov law motion capit two differ definit product labor conflat smith treat first one correct labor produc capit product labor
TEXT:  The only labor that is productive is labor that produces a profit for the entrepreneur who uses it. This definition—according to Marx—can completely disregard the content of labor. It does not matter if a business produces commodities or services, so long as a profit is obtained., LINE: 2927, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: labor product labor produc profit entrepreneur us definit accord complet disregard content labor doe matter busi produc commod servic long profit
TEXT:  The second definition of productive labor that Marx finds in Smith is “labor which in general ‘produces a value’ ” (Marx 1963: 156). What is at issue here is another property of labor: namely, that it is value-creating., LINE: 2928, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: second definit product labor find smith labor gener produc valu issu anoth properti labor name valu
TEXT:  Hence, in the sense of Adam Smith’s second definition, such labor is unproductive as it creates no value and thus also no surplus-value and thus also no surplus product.

TEXT:  It is unproductive in Marx’s sense, if the column entry is zero: hence, no profit is obtained.

TEXT:  A business is value-consuming, if the corresponding row entry is zero. It is thus entirely possible to demonstrate both aspects of being productive independently of each other.

TEXT:  In this way, the prices of goods could be established without a market being needed. We should, however, also call attention to a difficulty in comparison to capitalist enterprises.

TEXT:  To this end, they often use new technology that saves labor, material and energy—and that perhaps also improves the quality of the product—in order to increase their own rate of profit.

TEXT:  Why would we want to get rid of money? The medium of money has three functions: payment, valuation, and storage.

TEXT:  The design for a non-money economy would be that of a fundamental utopia, and it would stand in opposition to an economy based on money. A non-money economy would do away with the possibility of storing values and assets; it would replace the functions of valuation and payment with a system that distributes things and activities using algorithms., LINE: 2999, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: design non money economi would fundament utopia would stand opposit economi base money non money economi would away possibl valu asset would replac function valuat payment system thing activ algorithm
TEXT:  This is already possible, technically speaking, because we keep digital records of every transaction, and we can crunch enough data to replace the market’s information function. In this sense, the concept of a non-money economy represents a radical, leftist utopia: an economy that would strive toward equal distribution and that would do so by changing the current system in a fundamental way, based on money’s role as a medium., LINE: 3000, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: alreadi possibl technic speak keep digit record everi transact crunch enough data replac market inform function sens concept non money economi radic leftist utopia economi would strive toward equal distribut would current system fundament way base money role medium

TEXT:  Rather than labor, the act of giving—the essential transaction—should serve as the basis for the economy.

As a result, division—not labor—is the primary act involved in the creation of an economy built on the division of labor. In any case, we need to take a closer look at what economic activity actually means., LINE: 3012, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: contrast transact alway social relationship kind result divis labor primari act involv creation economi built divis labor case need take closer look econom activ actual mean
TEXT:  The notion of labor is intrinsic to money economies in the form of paid, productive activity. In the absence of money, the economic value of an activity is determined by whether and how it is shared. Every format and structure both of giving and of exchange—payments, prices, values, buyers, consumption, supply, demand, and markets—can be traced back to simple acts of giving., LINE: 3013, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: notion labor intrins money economi form product activ absenc money econom valu activ determin whether everi format structur give exchang payment price valu buyer consumpt suppli demand market back simpl act give

TEXT:  The same goes for money. Previously, simple transactions predominated: gifts, for example, even forced ones in the form of taxes. The process of measuring and recording gifts in numerical form began, not with money, but with systems of inscription that were usually linked to temples., LINE: 3015, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: go money previous simpl transact gift exampl even forc one form tax process measur record gift numer form money system inscript usual link templ
TEXT:  The various narratives suggesting that the economy began with exchange are not just historically inaccurate but refuse to acknowledge that there was an economy before the existence of money.

TEXT:  (…) 3. Media and Networks When, exactly, data will be able to take over the tasks of money depends on the relationship between computing power and transactions.

TEXT:  We now stand at the threshold; actually, chances are we’ve already crossed it. Economic forms that don’t rely on money are not entirely new.

TEXT: ) In reciting the Lord’s Prayer, one of the most famous of all, Christians the world over ask day in and day out, millions of times over: “Forgive us our sins, as we forgive those who sin against us.” Unfortunately, they have forgotten the economic basis of these lines: The Hebrew word for “sin” also means “debt., LINE: 3020, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: lord prayer one famou world ask day day million time forgiv sin forgiv sin unfortun forgotten econom basi line word sin also mean debt
TEXT: ” And Luther’s translation of that line, Matthew 6.12, reflected that: “Forgive us our debts, as we forgive our debtors.” Today’s version distorts the original meaning on behalf of a more market friendly version of Christianity., LINE: 3021, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: translat line reflect forgiv debt forgiv debtor today version origin mean behalf market friendli version
TEXT:  With the shift from a centralized system of inscription to a decentralized one, namely money, forgiving debts went out of fashion. This was no coincidence, as the numerous believers who had come to occupy a central position of power were more interested in collecting debts than in forgiving them., LINE: 3022, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: shift system inscript one name money forgiv debt went fashion wa coincid numer believ come occupi central posit power interest debt forgiv
TEXT:  Christianity responded by replacing debt with sin and replacing the custom of forgiving debts with confession, which is to say through a form of control. Historically speaking, economic relations did not begin with exchange, and they most certainly did not begin with payment., LINE: 3023, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: debt sin custom forgiv debt confess say form control histor speak econom relat begin exchang certainli begin payment
TEXT:  First, people gave, they helped, they lent. The concept of property did not exist. In small village communities, memory was all they needed to more or less keep track of who had given what to whom.

TEXT:  Records of gifts and debts can be found at the excavation sites of numerous ancient civilizations. Ultimately, the invention of writing can be traced back to such archives of gifts and fees.

TEXT:  This has included everything from payments to promises of payment, from the coin to the promissory note, from paper money to digital currencies.

TEXT:  Transformations in media often proceeed in two phases. First, new media imitate old media, and they conserve earlier rituals and practices. In the case of Bitcoin, it’s the replication of money in the shape of networks., LINE: 3034, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: transform medium often two phase first new medium imit old medium conserv ritual practic case replic money shape network
TEXT:  Only in the second phase will it become clear how new digital media might develop a solution all their own, a solution beyond money. This has yet to happen in the case of the economy. It will occur when intelligent networks assume money’s economic function of distributing things and tasks., LINE: 3035, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: second phase becom clear new digit medium might develop solut solut beyond money ha yet happen case economi occur intellig network assum money econom function thing task
TEXT:  The most valuable aspect of peer-to-peer currencies is the architecture they rely upon, the so-called blockchain. It represents the basis for a decentralized mode of administration within which transactions can be processed and validated anonymously., LINE: 3036, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: valuabl aspect peer peer currenc architectur reli upon basi mode administr within transact anonym
TEXT:  The method works just as well for money as it does for systems of notation that aren’t based on money and that are decentralized. The blockchain therefore represents a possible building block for a non-money economy., LINE: 3037, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: method work well money doe system notat base money therefor possibl build block non money economi

TEXT:  The same applies for an economy that’s not based on money. We won’t be able to plan it out. It will emerge in the niches and obscure corners of networks and spread out from there. (…) 4. Matching Matching is the most important process in a non-money economy., LINE: 3041, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: economi base money abl plan emerg nich obscur corner network spread match match import process non money economi
TEXT:  The process assumes functions that are otherwise controlled by prices and by the market. “To match” simply means to classify, to assign or to link. Matching serves to connect any participants and any of their desires, needs, possibilities, abilities, and resources., LINE: 3042, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: process function otherwis price market match simpli mean assign link match serf connect particip desir need possibl abil resourc
TEXT:  It mediates between these factors, it can advise participants in their decisions, and it both follows along in any negotiations and takes note of the result.

TEXT:  The result of a matching procedure can be described as a transition between two states: before and after. That’s because every matched transaction has some effects that go beyond the immediate participants—even if the effects are minor., LINE: 3046, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: result match procedur transit two state everi transact ha effect beyond immedi particip even effect minor
TEXT:  The environment includes any and all links and information that go into the matching process, that are then processed, and that are reflected in the end result. All the decisions made along the way are accounted for, not just in terms of what’s given and what’s taken, but also in terms of the good itself and any impact made on the third party., LINE: 3047, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: environ link inform match process reflect end result decis made along way term given taken also term good impact made third parti
TEXT:  Factors that go into making a match include similar transactions, the history of transactions in the participants’ profiles and the participants’ desires, needs and capacities. Matching accounts for all of these parameters in order to suggest one or more possible solutions., LINE: 3048, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: factor make match includ similar transact histori transact particip profil particip desir need capac match account paramet order suggest one possibl solut

TEXT:  And it would scale to meet those proportions. (…) Matching makes suggestions along the way to a decision. It identifies opportunities. And it oversees the decision-making process. The algorithm might even point out something we want before we realize we want it., LINE: 3052, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: would scale meet proport match make suggest along way decis opportun decis make process algorithm might even point someth want realiz want

TEXT:  The more advantages people come to expect from predictive machines, the more likely they will be to rely on them. In this way, socially recognized patterns of behavior emerge all on their own. No matter what time period we’re talking about—the future, the present or the past—changes in media never come about due to need., LINE: 3054, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: advantag peopl come expect predict machin like reli way social pattern behavior emerg matter time period talk futur present past chang medium never come due need

TEXT:  We are already familiar with most of the steps in the matching process. We experience them all the time, for example when we search for something online or offer something of our own for sale.

Matching in itself is nothing new., LINE: 3060, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: rather distribut directli also mean transact valu accord fix price match noth new
TEXT:  Even in an economy that operates with the use of money, it is constantly taking place. When we buy things, or somebody pays us for our labor, that’s a matching process. It’s just that this process follows different rules than it would in a world without money., LINE: 3061, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: even economi use money constantli take place buy thing somebodi pay labor match process process differ rule would world without money

TEXT:  Also, in a non-money economy, it won’t always be the case that we’ll be free from such concerns. Some wishes will still go unfulfilled, and some will remain unfulfillable.

The abstract setting in which this agreement is reached is called the market., LINE: 3072, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: ideal price particip transact compar transact agre upon abstract set agreement market
TEXT:  Local prices might deviate from the market price, but not by much. Otherwise, they will be made to match through arbitrage. Values, in contrast, are always relational.

TEXT:  That is to say, they are valid for a specific group of people, and they relate to a specific time or place. There is no single, fixed value of a thing or a good.

TEXT:  We come in contact with the various domains of value every day. Take a trip, for example. Imagine I’d like to go visit a friend, but I’m in no particular rush to do so. If the price of the flight is low enough on a day that’s convenient for me, I’ll buy the ticket—as soon as my personal micro value outweighs the fluctuating market price., LINE: 3084, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: come contact variou domain valu everi day take trip exampl imagin like visit friend particular rush price flight low enough day conveni buy ticket soon person micro valu market price

TEXT:  The way in which we set the matching algorithm to relate to valuations is, in fact, a political decision, since the matching algorithm acts as an intermediary between personal freedom and general interest., LINE: 3088, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: way set match algorithm relat valuat fact polit decis sinc match algorithm act intermediari person freedom gener interest

TEXT:  Underlying perpetual class warfare is this moralistic idea of work. It occupies an indispensable position, ideologically speaking. It is essentially dogma: If you work, you suffer.

TEXT:  Constantly, there appear new lists of endangered jobs. It’s as if any activity that can be automated is something we should fight to save from machines taking it over. But do we really need to save the job of truck driver? What about that of the launderer, who used to wash clothes by hand in the river, and whose job was made obsolete by washing machines? Why not go back to the time of human “computers,” primarily women, who once worked in large offices doing calculations by hand? It doesn’t make any sense to preserve jobs that machines are capable of automating just so that people—who anyway often loathe their jobs—can keep them., LINE: 3097, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: constantli appear new list job activ someth fight save machin take realli need save job truck driver launder use wash cloth hand river whose job wa made obsolet wash machin back time human comput primarili woman work larg offic calcul hand make sens preserv job machin capabl peopl anyway often loath job keep
TEXT:  The problem isn’t with the proliferation of machine work, but with the inability of the economic regime to distribute the benefits of automization fairly.

TEXT:  Things will be no different in the case of so-called intelligent machines. The question of what work will be taken over in the future by machines and bots is, in a non-money economy, irrelevent. For every task that we allow to be automated, new activities will emerge within the same field., LINE: 3099, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: thing differ case intellig machin question work taken futur machin bot non money economi everi task allow new activ emerg within field

TEXT:  But it wouldn’t find buyers for anything, because no one would be able to afford anything. This won’t happen.

TEXT:  In order to analyze the future of “labor,” it will be necessary to stick with the abstract, umbrella term of “activity.” Most of the time, we’re doing something. In thinking about what we do, it will intially suffice to distinguish between two types of activities: relational and non-relational., LINE: 3109, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: order analyz futur labor necessari stick abstract umbrella term activ time someth think suffic distinguish two type activ relat non relat

TEXT:  To give an example: When a number of people read a piece of information, they refer to it. In the process, it gains value, but so does the act of reading, which in itself is a form of value creation. The existence of a successful relation is what brings an activity into an economic relationship., LINE: 3113, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: give exampl number peopl read piec inform refer process gain valu doe act read form valu creation exist success relat activ econom relationship

TEXT:  The era of thoughtless objects is coming to an end. This will have various consequences, both in terms of the economic as well as the philosophical status of things.

TEXT: ” That vocabulary doesn’t name what’s new; instead, it frames new phenomena as dangerous. The general attitude remains protective, defensive, skeptical, fearful.

TEXT:  This does not, however, yet tell us anything, secondly, about whether digital media also make such an upheaval possible. The question is: Can digital media be used to develop alternative—let us say—structures or mechanisms that replace money and the market in the coordinating roles that they currently play? This cannot mean identically duplicating them, since that would be pointless., LINE: 3152, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: doe howev yet tell anyth secondli whether digit medium also make upheav possibl question digit medium use develop altern let say structur mechan replac money market role current play cannot mean ident sinc would pointless

TEXT:  Golumbia 2015; Ortlieb 2014). The objection that one simply does not need any replacement for the coordinating mechanisms, since all coordination could take place in direct (verbal?) communication, is not a realistic response—even leaving aside the fact that direct (verbal?) communication would, then, be the replacement (see below)., LINE: 3154, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: object one simpli doe need replac mechan sinc could take place direct verbal commun realist respons even leav asid fact direct verbal commun would replac see
TEXT:  In order to approach the question concerning alternative forms of coordination, we will here discuss Friedrich August von Hayek. Why Hayek of all people: arch-liberal (in the classical sense) and tireless defender of the market? Hayek described the coordinating role of the market in terms of knowledge., LINE: 3155, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: order approach question concern altern form discu august peopl arch liber classic sens tireless defend market role market term knowledg
TEXT:  For Hayek, the special role of the market is to serve as a kind of medium that can actualize and coordinate the dispersed knowledge of society’s members: “The various ways in which the knowledge on which people base their plans is communicated to them is the crucial problem for any theory explaining the economic process” (Hayek [1945] 1948: 78)., LINE: 3156, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: special role market serv kind medium actual dispers knowledg societi member variou way knowledg peopl base plan crucial problem theori explain econom process
TEXT: 3 But this knowledge is not available to anybody in its entirety; it is distributed. In addition, it is situated, as Hayek never ceases to emphasize. More precisely, he differentiates various forms of knowledge: We can distinguish roughly between global, universal knowledge—like, say, the knowledge of the natural sciences—and the local, situated knowledge that is required for carrying out economic operations., LINE: 3157, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: knowledg avail anybodi entireti distribut addit situat never ceas emphas precis variou form knowledg distinguish roughli global univers knowledg like say knowledg natur scienc local situat knowledg carri econom oper
TEXT: 4 In particular, Hayek criticizes the fact that the model of natural-scientific knowledge has been projected onto economic processes, thus giving rise to the misconception that one could, so to say, transparently bring together this knowledge in one place., LINE: 3158, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: particular fact model natur scientif knowledg ha onto econom process thu give rise misconcept one could say transpar bring togeth knowledg one place
TEXT:  This is Hayek’s fundamental argument against every form of central economic planning. Thus, he emphasizes: If we can agree that the economic problem of society is mainly one of rapid adaptation to changes in the particular circumstances of time and place, it would seem to follow that the ultimate decisions must be left to the people who are familiar with these circumstances, who know directly of the relevant changes and of the resources immediately available to meet them., LINE: 3159, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: fundament argument everi form central econom thu agre econom problem societi mainli one rapid adapt chang particular circumst time place would seem follow ultim decis must left peopl familiar circumst know directli relev chang resourc immedi avail meet
TEXT:  We cannot expect that this problem will be solved by first communicating all this knowledge to a central board which, after integrating all knowledge, issues its orders. We must solve it by some form of decentralization., LINE: 3160, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: cannot expect problem first commun knowledg central board knowledg issu order must solv form
TEXT:  But this answers only part of our problem. We need decentralization because only thus can we insure that the knowledge of the particular circumstances of time and place will be promptly used. But the “man on the spot” cannot decide solely on the basis of his limited but intimate knowledge of the facts of his immediate surroundings., LINE: 3161, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: answer part problem need thu insur knowledg particular circumst time place promptli use man spot cannot decid sole basi limit intim knowledg fact immedi surround
TEXT:  There still remains the problem of communicating to him such further information as he needs to fit his decisions into the whole pattern of changes of the larger economic system. Hayek [1945] 1948: 83–84; emphasis added This “communication of information” already sounds a lot like a medial process: One need only, for example, think of the fact that Friedrich Kittler (1993: 8) defined media as technologies for saving, processing and communicating information., LINE: 3162, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: still remain problem commun inform need fit decis whole pattern chang econom system emphasi ad commun inform alreadi sound lot like medial process one need exampl think fact defin medium technolog save commun inform
TEXT:  According to Hayek, it occurs precisely by way of the price system: “We must look at the price system as such a mechanism for communicating information” (Hayek [1945] 1948: 86).5 Expressed in the medium of money that is exchanged for commodities, prices signal production needs, scarcity, etc., LINE: 3163, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: accord precis way price system must look price system mechan commun inform express medium money commod price signal product need scarciti
TEXT: 6 The first reason why our project has to deal with Hayek is that a post-monetary society must be able to specify a different mechanism of coordination. And it must, moreover, be one that is not susceptible to the same extent or at all to the problems of money-centered coordination: hence, say, the accumulation of monetary symbols as an end-in-itself, with possible consequences like the destruction of the environment, or the increasing rendering superfluous of people in the production process, with serious economic disturbances as consequence., LINE: 3164, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: first reason project ha deal post monetari societi must abl specifi differ mechan must moreov one suscept extent problem money center henc say accumul monetari symbol end possibl consequ like destruct environ increas render superflu peopl product process seriou econom disturb consequ
TEXT:  For, from a media-theoretical standpoint, one can critically note that Hayek conceives the “price mechanism” as transparent medium of distributed and situated knowledge, without supposing that the medium can have its own dynamic., LINE: 3165, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: medium theoret standpoint one critic note price mechan transpar medium distribut situat knowledg without suppos medium dynam
TEXT: 7 The idea that the medium could become the actual center of the whole affair appears to be foreign to Hayek.

TEXT:  That medial processes are central to Hayek became especially clear during and after the so-called “socialist calculation debate” between Mises, Hayek and their critics. Thus, for example, Oskar Lange (1972: 402) later remarked: “The market process with its cumbersome tatonnements appears old-fashioned., LINE: 3168, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: medial process central especi clear socialist calcul debat critic thu exampl later market process cumbersom old fashion
TEXT:  Indeed, it may be considered as a computing device of the pre-electronic age.”10 So, if the market and its price system are a kind of digital medium (inasmuch as prices are digital—they do not involve any continuum, but only discrete gradations), what, then, does the emergence of digital media in the narrower sense mean? Could the price system not only be disrupted by these digital media, as already discussed, but possibly even, in a positive sense, replaced by them? Lange seems to suggest this., LINE: 3169, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: inde may consid devic electron age market price system kind digit medium inasmuch price digit involv continuum discret gradat doe emerg digit medium narrow sens mean could price system digit medium alreadi possibl even posit sens suggest

TEXT: 11) Lavoie (1990: 75) calls this “computopia”:12 “[A]n image of an economy being centrally planned by a massive computer.… Do the undeniably rapid advances in computer science suggest that even if this computopia is farfetched now, it might become a realistic alternative in the future?” But the whole debate revolves around the question of market versus central planning, as is underscored by the paradigmatic role of central mainframes., LINE: 3171, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: call imag economi central massiv comput undeni rapid advanc comput scienc suggest even farfetch might becom realist altern futur whole debat around question market versu central paradigmat role central
TEXT:  Interestingly, however, already in Hayek ([1945] 1948: 79), we can read: This is not a dispute about whether planning is to be done or not. It is a dispute as to whether planning is to be done centrally, by one authority for the whole economic system, or is to be divided among many individuals., LINE: 3172, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: interestingli howev alreadi read disput whether done disput whether done central one author whole econom system divid among mani individu
TEXT:  Planning in the specific sense in which the term is used in contemporary controversy necessarily means central planning—direction of the whole economic system according to one unified plan.

TEXT:  This is to say that the market order is a sort of decentralized planning, and to function as such, a system of mediations must be established to facilitate the exchange of knowledge.

TEXT:  This is an important point, to which we will return below.) Lavoie (1990) suggests that we can understand the “market” in three different ways, one of which—the market as a motivator of performance—we will bracket here., LINE: 3175, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: import point return understand market three differ way one market perform bracket
TEXT:  He differentiates the market as a kind of computer, in the sense just discussed, from an understanding of the market (following Hayek) as a kind of system of communication. This is underscored by the fact that Hayek ([1945] 1948: 87) described the “price system as a kind of machinery for registering change, or a system of telecommunications”—a description which is reminiscent, say, of the telephone network., LINE: 3176, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: market kind comput sens understand market follow kind system commun fact price system kind machineri chang system descript reminisc say telephon network
TEXT:  Again Lavoie (1990: 78) on the market as a system of communication: “There is thus a bidirectional communicative process that produces a kind of social intelligence that depends on but goes beyond, the individual intelligences of the system’s participants., LINE: 3177, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: market system commun thu bidirect commun process produc kind social intellig go beyond individu intellig system particip
TEXT: ” Here, an entirely different medial model emerges: No longer a central computer, a computer as calculator, but rather—since the “bidirectional communicative process” is not only reminiscent of the telephone network, of course—networked computers., LINE: 3178, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: entir differ medial model longer central comput comput calcul rather sinc bidirect commun process reminisc telephon network cours comput

TEXT:  Since then, at the latest, the image of the computer as medium of communication has been supplanting that of the computer as calculator.

TEXT:  Here Lavoie (1990: 74) on the market yet again: “What is crucial to its cognitive function, however, is that it provides a discovery process that by its very nature cannot be centrally directed but depends on a bidirectional communicative interplay between its participants., LINE: 3181, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: market yet crucial cognit function howev discoveri process natur cannot central direct bidirect commun interplay particip

TEXT:  In any case, the following description of the market by Hayek ([1945] 1948: 86) already sounds a lot like a network: “The whole acts as one market, not because any of its members survey the whole field, but because their limited individual fields of vision sufficiently overlap so that through many intermediaries the relevant information is communicated to all., LINE: 3183, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: case follow descript market alreadi sound lot like network whole act one market member survey whole field limit individu field vision suffici overlap mani intermediari relev inform
TEXT: ” Now, at the latest, we can ask whether beyond the alternatives: 1.market (= decentralized planning with money or the price system as “system of telecommunications”) and 2.state planning (= central planning with a central computer; depending on the approach, with money still, though sometimes also conceived without money), there is not also 3., LINE: 3184, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: latest ask whether beyond altern market money price system system state central central comput depend approach money still though sometim also without money also

TEXT: ) Concerning the market, Lavoie (1990: 78; emphasis added) writes: “This knowledge, as encapsulated in prices, serves in turn to guide the decisions of individual participants.” If knowledge transfer is so important, one could ask whether it would not be far better if the knowledge were not “encapsulated in prices,” but rather directly available (unless one could separately show that this “encapsulation” is indispensable: e., LINE: 3187, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: concern market emphasi ad knowledg price serf turn guid decis individu particip knowledg transfer import one could ask whether would far better knowledg price rather directli avail unless one could separ show encapsul indispens
TEXT: g. as a kind of reduction of complexity). A decentralized collection, processing and distribution of information could take place using data networks. One should by no means think here only of communication in the sense of exchange in a natural language, but rather one should also consider the possibilities created by the rendering mobile of the internet in the form, for instance, of mobile and GPS-tracked devices., LINE: 3188, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: kind reduct complex collect distribut inform could take place data network one mean think commun sens exchang natur languag rather one also consid possibl render mobil form instanc mobil track devic
TEXT:  These mobile media are in keeping with the “knowledge of the particular circumstances of time and place” on which Hayek placed so much emphasis. Today, mobile media are essentially situated media. Hence, they can, in principle, depict and process local knowledge and thus connect it with other local knowledge in a network., LINE: 3189, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: mobil medium keep knowledg particular circumst time place much emphasi today mobil medium essenti situat medium henc principl depict process local knowledg thu connect local knowledg network
TEXT:  There is another aspect to be found in Hayek that is not identical with the question of the spatio-temporal situatedness of knowledge: namely, the question of “tacit knowledge” (cf. Oguz 2010). The thesis is as follows: “The impossibility of conveying tacit knowledge of market participants to a higher authority became central to his defense of decentralization and free market” (Oguz 2010: 146)., LINE: 3190, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: anoth aspect found ident question tempor knowledg name question tacit knowledg thesi imposs tacit knowledg market particip higher author central defens free market
TEXT: 13 Presumably, this means that the market makes knowledge usable that participants themselves cannot articulate—and hence a central planning cannot make usable. However, the assumption that the price system somehow makes this tacit knowledge available, after all—in a “communicative process,” as Lavoie (1990: 78) writes—shows that it is not entirely incommunicable, since otherwise it could not have any relevance for the market process either., LINE: 3191, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: presum mean market make knowledg usabl particip cannot articul henc central cannot make usabl howev assumpt price system somehow make tacit knowledg avail commun process show entir incommunic sinc otherwis could relev market process either
TEXT:  Hence, is it not conceivable that non-verbalized knowledge could also be made operational in a different way? And do not the techniques of profiling and tracking that are characteristic of “social media,” as they are tellingly called, do just that? We will return to this point below., LINE: 3192, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: henc conceiv non knowledg could also made oper differ way techniqu characterist social medium tellingli return point
TEXT:  It is likewise by no means apparent why only the market or competition can function as a discovery procedure—as Hayek ([1968] 2014) argues in another famous essay. Is it not also possible for cooperation to be a discovery procedure, as both developments in the area of software (keyword: open source) and classical large-scale military, scientific and industrial research suggest (cf., LINE: 3193, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: likewis mean appar market competit function discoveri procedur anoth famou essay also possibl discoveri procedur develop area open sourc classic larg scale militari scientif industri research suggest
TEXT:  Allen and Potts 2016)? In fact, even if the original impulse for it comes from competition, the development of marketable products for the most part presupposes extensive cooperative processes: processes that are being expanded and fostered by the use of networked computer systems., LINE: 3194, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: fact even origin impuls come competit develop market product part extens process process expand use comput system
TEXT:  This has led to the formation of a special area of research in so-called “computer-supported cooperative work” (cf. Schüttpelz and Gießmann 2015). It may be of interest to note here that, even if it is centered on the market, Hayek’s emphasis on self-organization was also an important influence on the Bloomington School, out of which, as is well known, Elinor Ostrom’s research grew (cf., LINE: 3195, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: ha led format special area research comput work may interest note even center market emphasi self organ wa also import influenc school well known research grew
TEXT:  Horn 2013: 228). We can only allude to this aspect here, but in the preface to the German edition of her main work on the commons, in particular, Ostrom emphasizes the key role of communication for coordinating cooperation (cf., LINE: 3196, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: horn allud aspect prefac german edit main work common particular key role commun
TEXT:  Ostrom 1999: xviii and passim). We can again ask whether the (at least in Western countries) nearly ubiquitous networking of mobile media does not provide a favorable infrastructural precondition for commons “beyond market and state,” as it is called in the subtitle of a well-known book (cf., LINE: 3197, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: ask whether least western countri nearli ubiquit mobil medium doe provid favor precondit common beyond market state subtitl well known book
TEXT:  Helfrich and Heinrich-Böll-Stiftung 2012). (The German translation (Ostrom 1999) of Ostrom’s Governing the Commons has the same subtitle.) As far as we can see, Hayek’s approach of emphasizing decentralization and self-organization, as well as emphasizing situated and tacit knowledge and the need for discovery procedures, in no way excludes the possibility that there could be ways of organizing production, allocation and distribution other than the market and hence the exchanging of commodities for money., LINE: 3198, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: boll german translat govern common ha subtitl far see approach self organ well situat tacit knowledg need discoveri procedur way possibl could way product alloc distribut market henc commod money
TEXT:  To this extent, it seems to us that the accuracy of Burczak’s (2006: 138) claim has yet to be established: “Post-Hayekian socialism is necessarily market socialism.

TEXT: ” Don Lavoie (1990: 75) similarly suggests: Those nonmarket forms of socialism that used to argue for the abolition of money needed to be reminded that the cognitive function markets serve requires that profit-loss calculation take place in terms of a common denominator., LINE: 3200, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: similarli nonmarket form social use argu abolit money cognit function market serv profit loss calcul take place term common denomin
TEXT:  There can be no systematic comparison of alternative production techniques without cost calculations in money units, and these at base involve matters of simple arithmetic.

TEXT:  This argument can, nonetheless, be rejected as specious: For money is precisely the medium that makes everything calculable as profit or loss—indeed that requires that everything be calculable in this way—and, of course, this form of profit/loss cannot be preserved without money., LINE: 3202, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: argument nonetheless speciou money precis medium make everyth calcul profit loss inde everyth calcul way cours form profit loss cannot without money

TEXT:  Lavoie’s (1990: 74) argument that “markets provide a cognitive aid, in this sense, without which economic activity would be prohibitively inefficient,” may be incorrect in the sense that what is important is not always whether something is efficient, but rather what one wants., LINE: 3205, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: argument market provid cognit aid sens without econom activ would prohibit ineffici may incorrect sens import alway whether someth effici rather one want
TEXT:  Nonetheless, Lavoie alludes to a non-trivial point: Money and the representation of products and processes in prices that comes with it make these products and processes comparable and calculable (although only in certain respects)., LINE: 3206, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: nonetheless non trivial point money represent product process price come make product process compar calcul although certain respect

TEXT: 14 In any case, a post-monetary society cannot mean a post-mathematical society. Instead of commodities communicating, human actors must communicate about their production, and they will have always to consider what seems doable and what does not—and this will make quantitative comparisons necessary., LINE: 3209, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: case post monetari societi cannot mean post mathemat societi instead commod commun human actor must commun product alway consid doabl doe make quantit comparison necessari

TEXT:  But the argument that, at least in principle, non-monetary decentralized coordination must also be possible has not only been attacked by neo-Hayekians like Lavoie and Hodgson. As has already been indicated, the whole discussion that has been conducted here can also be attacked from an emancipatory perspective: Is it not simply an attempt to create technical solutions to social problems? Is not the decisive point rather to replace—along with Marx—the organizational form of production that is coordinated ex post by directly communicative ex ante production: or, in other words, to replace the “isolated producers” by a kind of grassroots democratic collective production? Yes, that is the point: It is the only way to get rid of markets and money., LINE: 3212, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: argument least principl non monetari must also possibl ha neo like ha alreadi whole discuss ha also emancipatori perspect simpli attempt creat technic solut social problem decis point rather replac along organiz form product post directli commun ant product word replac isol produc kind democrat collect product ye point way get rid market money

TEXT:  It is interesting to note that like Hayek—with the sole difference that Hayek does so precisely in a positive sense—the value-critical critic of capitalism, Robert Kurz, also illustrates the indirectness of market- and money-mediated communication using the example of the telephone., LINE: 3215, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: interest note like sole differ doe precis posit sens valu critic critic capit also indirect market money commun exampl telephon
TEXT:  Kurz (1999: 785) writes that “the money form … is as crazy as if people who live in the same house were only permitted to communicate by satellite telephone.” It remains symptomatic in this example that Kurz mentions “people who live in the same house”: It is obvious that such people could communicate without a “satellite telephone” or, in other words, without indirect mediation., LINE: 3216, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: money form crazi peopl live hous permit commun satellit telephon remain symptomat exampl mention peopl live hous obviou peopl could commun without satellit telephon word without indirect mediat

But what about on the regional or global level?

TEXT:  Rather, they are absolutely key and thus also concern the commons, as soon as we upscale from a local commons to a larger interconnected network.

TEXT:  It connects up with a current discussion that asks what the medial coordinating mechanisms of a post-monetary society could look like. Also taking Hayek as his starting point, Nick Dyer-Witheford (2013: 12–13) has discussed such questions and different technical options at length in his outstanding essay “Red Plenty Platforms”: A society of participatory, informed, democratic and timely collective planning would require fast, varied and interactive communicative platforms where proposals could be circulated, responded to, at length or briefly, trends identified, reputations established, revisions and amendments generated, and so on., LINE: 3226, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: current discuss medial mechan post monetari societi could look like also take start point nick dyer ha question differ technic option length outstand essay red plenti platform societi participatori inform democrat time collect would requir fast vari interact commun platform propos could length briefli trend reput establish revis amend

In what follows, we would like to pursue this question by examining the previously introduced thesis that tracking technologies, as well as self-tracking in particular, are able, as pervasive mobile media technologies, to feel out tacit knowledge and render it usable., LINE: 3237, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: one feel necess quell pseudo need instead artifici gener need pose question need realli exist knowledg acquir neither produc consum name say noth would like pursu question examin previous thesi technolog well self particular abl pervas mobil medium technolog feel tacit knowledg render usabl
TEXT:  In order to get closer to an answer to the question, we want first to outline how “knowledge” can be obtained. The distinction between explicit and tacit knowledge is well-known. According to Ikujirō Nonaka and Hirotaka Takeuchi (1995: 8), “explicit knowledge can be expressed in words and numbers, and easily communicated and shared in the form of hard data, scientific formulae, codified procedures, or universal principles., LINE: 3238, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: order get closer answer question want first outlin knowledg distinct explicit tacit knowledg well known accord explicit knowledg express word number easili form hard data scientif formula procedur univers principl
TEXT: ” Per this definition, knowledge is something that is communicable and, above all, conscious. Whereas explicit knowledge can be communicated, expressed and shared, tacit knowledge is subjective, cannot be (directly) articulated and stays in the thoughts of the individual., LINE: 3239, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: per definit knowledg someth communic consciou wherea explicit knowledg express tacit knowledg subject cannot directli articul stay thought individu
TEXT:  Nonaka and Takeuchi (1995: 8) distinguish here between two dimensions of tacit knowledge: [T]he technical dimension … encompasses the kind of informal and hard-to-pin-down skills or crafts captured in the term “know-how., LINE: 3240, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: distinguish two dimens tacit knowledg technic dimens kind inform hard pin skill craft term know
TEXT: ” … At the same time, tacit knowledge contains an important cognitive dimension. It consists of schemata, mental models, beliefs, and perceptions so ingrained that we take them for granted.… Though they cannot be articulated very easily, these implicit models shape the way we perceive the world around us., LINE: 3241, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: time tacit knowledg import cognit dimens schema mental model belief percept ingrain take though cannot articul easili implicit model shape way perceiv world around
TEXT:  Tacit knowledge represents the larger part of knowledge as a whole. If it is to be made usable, it has to be converted into understandable words or codes. For even if it is difficult to express, it can be codified (cf., LINE: 3242, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: tacit knowledg part knowledg whole made usabl ha convert understand word code even difficult express
TEXT:  Kabir and Carayannis 2013: 56), since tacit knowledge consists, after all, of information. Thus, for example, the ability to ride a bicycle is tacit knowledge, which is also implicitly transferred by observation and imitation., LINE: 3243, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: sinc tacit knowledg inform thu exampl abil ride bicycl tacit knowledg also implicitli transfer observ imit
TEXT:  Nonetheless, knowledge of how to ride a bicycle can be transposed into a code: for example, using illustrations that show what needs to be done step-by-step. Another example of the second dimension of tacit knowledge could be describing the feeling of “being cozy., LINE: 3244, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: nonetheless knowledg ride bicycl code exampl illustr show need done step step anoth exampl second dimens tacit knowledg could feel cozi
TEXT: ” By means of analogies or vivid language, an individual understanding could be made a shared one. The tacit knowledge thus becomes communicable and, to a certain degree, explicit. In the process of converting tacit into explicit knowledge, new knowledge is made accessible (cf., LINE: 3245, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: mean analog vivid languag individu understand could made one tacit knowledg thu becom communic certain degre explicit process convert tacit explicit knowledg new knowledg made access
TEXT:  Nonaka and Takeuchi 1995: 9, 12–13) Hayek too turned his attention to tacit knowledge: The peculiar character of the problems of a rational economic order is determined precisely by the fact that the knowledge of the circumstances of which we must make use never exists in concentrated or integrated form, but solely as the dispersed bits of incomplete and frequently contradictory knowledge which all the separate individuals possess., LINE: 3246, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: turn attent tacit knowledg peculiar charact problem ration econom order determin precis fact knowledg circumst must make use never concentr form sole dispers bit incomplet frequent contradictori knowledg separ individu possess
TEXT:  The economic problem of society is thus not merely a problem of how to allocate “given” resources … it is a problem of the utilization of knowledge not given to anyone in its totality. Hayek [1945] 1948: 77–78; cited inNonaka and Takeuchi 1995: 33 Now, Nonaka and Takeuchi (1995) argue that Hayek overlooked the possibility of converting tacit and context-specific knowledge into explicit knowledge., LINE: 3247, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: econom problem societi thu mere problem alloc given resourc problem util knowledg given anyon total argu possibl convert tacit context specif knowledg explicit knowledg
TEXT:  Contrary to his intentions, Hayek’s theory of the market is thus static and solely focuses on the efficient use of available knowledge. As discussed above, the question has to be posed of whether, as against Hayek’s view (as well as that of Hodgson (1998, 2005)), tacit knowledge of needs could not also become explicit., LINE: 3248, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: contrari intent theori market thu static sole focu effici use avail knowledg question ha whether view well tacit knowledg need could also becom explicit
TEXT:  Thus, one step in finding out what should be produced consists in collecting implicit knowledge: As already mentioned, Big Data represents one possibility in this respect. The internet with its search engines and social networks (and hence self-established profiles)—but also (online) shopping, client cards, credit cards, “point” cards, etc., LINE: 3249, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: thu one step find produc implicit knowledg alreadi big data one possibl respect search engin social network henc self establish profil also shop client card credit card point card

TEXT:  The aim is currently product optimization and the possibility of figuring out in advance how innovations can be better brought onto the market (cf. Gabler Wirtschafslexikon n.d.). The collection of data (both self-provided data and data that has been collected by others) often takes place surreptitiously: The persons involved can be identified via their activities and monitored—because they undertake a purchase or have activated the location data on their smartphones., LINE: 3251, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: aim current product optim possibl advanc innov better brought onto market collect data self provid data data ha collect often take place surreptiti person involv via activ undertak purchas locat data
TEXT:  Big Data thus represents a challenge for data protection, since “often the person affected has not given any authorization for the use of the data.… The combination of information that is in itself unproblematic can lead to problematic findings” (Gabler Wirtschafslexikon n., LINE: 3252, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: big data thu challeng data protect sinc often person affect ha given author use data combin inform unproblemat lead problemat find

The person or persons affected can be classified as not creditworthy, risky or even suspicious, “because [he or she] lives in the wrong part of town, uses certain means of transportation and reads particular books” (Gabler Wirtschafslexikon n., LINE: 3253, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: person person affect classifi riski even suspici life wrong part town us certain mean transport read particular book
TEXT: d.). One potentially positive aspect of Big Data could be that the needs of users are recognized in advance and he or she, on the one hand, does not need to think any more about obtaining or ordering, but, on the other, has no influence on the things provided to him or her (keyword: pre-shipping/predictive delivery; cf., LINE: 3254, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: one potenti posit aspect big data could need user advanc one hand doe need think ha influenc thing provid ship predict deliveri
TEXT:  Lomas 2014). Tracking technologies also form part of Big Data. But they represent their own group within it. Deborah Lupton notes that a distinction had to be made between data monitoring by oneself and data monitoring by a third party., LINE: 3255, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: technolog also form part big data repres group within note distinct made data oneself data third parti
TEXT:  In the introduction to her book The Quantified Self: A Sociology of Self-Tracking Cultures, she sums up this distinction as follows: “Indeed in many cases people have no knowledge of what data are collected on them, where these data are stored and to what purposes they are used by other actors and agencies., LINE: 3256, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: introduct book self sociolog self cultur sum distinct inde mani case peopl knowledg data collect data purpos use actor agenc
TEXT:  These are examples not of self-tracking, but of tracking of the self by others” (Lupton 2016a: 2). Further on, she continues: “Self-tracking differs, therefore, from covert surveillance or means of collecting information on people that result in data sets to which the subjects of monitoring do not have access” (Lupton 2016a: 2)., LINE: 3257, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: exampl self self self therefor covert surveil mean inform peopl result data set subject access

TEXT:  The aim is “[to obtain] extensive knowledge of oneself. How exactly do I tick, what is especially important or right for me or what precisely is not.

TEXT: d.). The data is obtained using intricate micro-computers in the form of tracking armbands, smartwatches and other wearables, which can be easily linked to one’s smartphone or tablet. Data gathering by way of self-measurement brings to light information from which knowledge can be derived: All self-tracking practices are essentially visualization practices, which make something visible that was not visible—in this way—before., LINE: 3261, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: data intric micro comput form wearabl easili link one tablet data gather way self measur light inform knowledg deriv self practic essenti visual practic make someth visibl wa visibl way

TEXT:  Duttweiler and Passoth also allude to the fact that tracking thereby makes possible reinforced monitoring and surveillance.

TEXT:  Schröter 2016: 194 But this is not presently the case. Unfortunately, in many service provider “terms and conditions,” formulations are to be found that show that, in addition to the data that the users themselves collect, information may also be gathered on the device on which the data is installed (cf., LINE: 3267, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: present case unfortun mani servic provid term condit formul found show addit data user collect inform may also devic data

TEXT:  Karanasiou and Kang (2016) note that the popularity of sensor-based measurement devices, which are able to track activity, health and mood, appears paradoxical in the post-Snowden era. On the one hand, one is of the view that unauthorized data collection by the state is incompatible with the right to privacy., LINE: 3269, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: kang note popular sensor base measur devic abl track activ health mood paradox post era one hand one view unauthor data collect state incompat right privaci
TEXT:  On the other hand, there is a trend to measuring and gathering one’s own data using sensors: “In this sense, it has been suggested that privacy has gradually changed its meaning: in the era of wearable tech we seem to be accepting that measuring data is not a privacy infringement but a self-surveillance exercise, most acute [sic., LINE: 3270, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: hand trend measur gather one data sensor sens ha privaci ha gradual mean era wearabl tech seem measur data privaci infring self surveil exercis acut sic
TEXT: ] to exercising one’s right to freely express oneself” (Karanasiou and Kang 2016: 123–124).

TEXT:  Every change in activity and every sort of gap can be detected by the use of self-tracking technologies, and it can be detected—thanks to the shortening of the feedback loop—without any loss of time: “Deviation and feedback are then simultaneous” (Schaupp 2016a: 70)., LINE: 3272, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: everi chang activ everi sort gap use self technolog thank shorten feedback loop without loss time deviat feedback simultan
TEXT:  Immediate feedback is important for the optimization of a system. Simon Schaupp suggests/advocates using the concept of a homeostat for self-tracking. A homeostat has to have at least three elements: Firstly, a sensor, which gathers data on the system to be regulated; secondly, a data-processing or classification mechanism, which filters and structures the collected data in a way that allows it to become relevant to the functioning of the system (a mere mirroring of all the facts pertaining to the system would not represent any gain in information)., LINE: 3273, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: immedi feedback import optim system advoc concept self ha least three element firstli sensor gather data system regul secondli data classif mechan filter structur collect data way becom relev system mere fact pertain system would repres gain inform
TEXT:  Thirdly, the homeostat has to have an output mechanism, which feeds the structured data back into the system. This feedback process is supposed to allow the system to adapt automatically to changing conditions: whether in order to maintain a desired state or to develop beyond it., LINE: 3274, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: thirdli ha output mechan feed structur data back system feedback process suppos allow system adapt automat condit whether order maintain desir state develop beyond
TEXT:  Schaupp 2016a: 91–92 Schaupp shows very precisely that self-tracking technologies resemble the idea of homeostats. They too possess measurement sensors and help the “system” to achieve self-optimization via feedback., LINE: 3275, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: show precis self technolog resembl idea possess measur sensor help system achiev self optim via feedback
TEXT:  If, now, the system is defined not as a single individual (as is often the case in self-tracking), but rather as a group, then this system too would be able to express its state in data, to make tacit knowledge usable, and to recognize how it can be optimized: to recognize, in other words, what it needs., LINE: 3276, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: system defin singl individu often case self rather group system would abl express state data make tacit knowledg usabl recogn recogn word need
TEXT:  Tracking thus represents a conceivable option for a form of communication beyond price signals. In the article “Society’s Nervous System: Building Effective Government, Energy, and Public Health Systems” from 2012, Alex Pentland (MIT Human Dynamics Laboratory) asks what potential “pervasive sensing” and “mobile computing” will hold over the next ten years and what challenges are involved, or could be involved, in exploiting this potential (cf., LINE: 3277, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: thu conceiv option form commun beyond price signal articl societi nervou system build effect govern energi public health system human dynam laboratori potenti pervas mobil hold next ten year challeng involv could involv potenti
TEXT:  Pentland 2012: 39). Right at the start, Pentland makes clear that current social structures do not use the possibilities of digital feedback technologies to the extent that one could, in order to be dynamic and responsive: “Instead of focusing only on access and distribution systems, we need dynamic, networked, self-regulating systems that take into account complex interactions., LINE: 3278, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: right start make clear current social structur use possibl digit feedback technolog extent one could order dynam respons instead access distribut system need dynam self system take account complex interact

TEXT:  In the further course of the article, he especially goes into smartphones as “location-aware sensor platforms” that can be used for self-tracking purposes: in order to understand patterns of human behavior, to monitor surroundings (for example, traffic and increased congestion), and to plan social development., LINE: 3280, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: cours articl especi go locat awar sensor platform use self purpos order understand pattern human behavior monitor surround exampl traffic congest plan social develop
TEXT:  In order to solve the problem of privacy and control over the data, Pentland suggests introducing laws that grant individuals a constant right to their own data and the use thereof: 1. You have the right to possess data about you., LINE: 3281, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: order solv problem privaci control data law grant individu constant right data use thereof right possess data
TEXT:  Regardless of what entity collects the data, the data belongs to you, and you can access it at any time.

TEXT: ” 2. You have the right to full control over the use of your data. The terms of use must be opt-in and clearly explained in plain language.

TEXT:  The possibilities mentioned here merely represent a suggestion. Both Pentland and Schaupp continue to discuss the technologies in connection with markets. As a “cybernetic self-technology,” Schaupp (2016b: 82) sees self-tracking as “in no way just an individual practice,” but rather the “expression of a political-economic shift,” which he describes as “cybernetic capitalism., LINE: 3285, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: possibl mere repres suggest continu discu technolog connect market cybernet self technolog see self way individu practic rather express polit econom shift cybernet capit
TEXT: ” But in a society after money, the question of tracking technologies as part of capital accumulation no longer arises. If one’s own data is protected, and it is assured that it is only used to generate the information required for the production and distribution of goods, self-tracking offers everyone the opportunity of greater participation in the organization of their own living conditions., LINE: 3286, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: societi money question technolog part capit accumul longer one data assur use gener inform product distribut good self offer everyon opportun greater particip organ live condit
TEXT:  This extends not only to the domains of existential and individual needs, but also to immaterial needs like, for example, health care, child care and elder care.

TEXT:  From an emancipatory perspective, it is often said that technical solutions cannot be substituted for social ones.

TEXT:  (A certain asymmetry is, however, to be observed in this regard: value-critical approaches, for instance, emphasize that there is no automatism that leads to an emancipated, post-capitalist society; but for value criticism, there is indeed an automatism that leads the competition-driven suppression of labor by new technologies up to the “inner limits” of capital., LINE: 3293, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: certain asymmetri howev regard valu critic approach instanc emphas automat lead post capitalist societi valu critic inde automat lead competit driven suppress labor new technolog inner limit capit

TEXT:  As against Hayek’s conclusion that the preeminent role of situated and tacit knowledge makes central state planning, and indeed any sort of communicative planning, impossible, and the market, and hence exchange for money, indispensable, we could thus say that this conclusion fails to take into account that the indirect communication of situated and tacit knowledge—the possibility of which is, in principle, assumed by the price mechanism—could also take place without money under the conditions of computer networks and mobile sensors (smartphones)., LINE: 3296, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: conclus role situat tacit knowledg make central state inde sort commun imposs market henc exchang money indispens could thu say conclus take account indirect commun situat tacit knowledg possibl principl assum price mechan could also take place without money condit comput network mobil sensor
TEXT:  Hayek’s emphasis on decentralization and self-organization is undoubtedly correct. But why should the money-centered market be the only or even the last and highest form of such organization?

TEXT: ” Monetary or market-based exchange values (prices) dominate, contort and marginalize the real “use values,” the purposes, qualities or uses of things.

TEXT:  Capitalism promotes growth. Capitalists use money to make more money, in processes with significant implications for the quality and quantity of those use values that we need in order to live.

TEXT:  A grassroots approach is the soundest way to institute such change with the necessary haste. So, what might such a world look like? How might it operate? A sketch of such a world, drawing generically on my previous work, elaborates on an alternative defined by Schröter (this volume) whereby: “People agree on what is to be produced, divide up the work, make the products, and distribute them according to the democratic decisions made at the outset., LINE: 3385, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: approach way institut chang necessari hast might world look like might oper sketch world draw gener previou work altern defin volum wherebi peopl agre produc divid work make product distribut accord democrat decis made outset
TEXT: ” One ecosocialist route would initially marginalize and ultimately dissolve the state and money to vest control on the basis of subsidiarity, with sub-sub-bioregional neighborhood precincts evolving as centers of economic and political power (“bioregional” meaning a landscape defined by the natural environment, such as topography and species, with sub-bioregions as sub-components)., LINE: 3386, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: one rout would initi margin ultim dissolv state money vest control basi sub sub neighborhood precinct center econom polit power mean landscap defin natur environ topographi speci sub sub compon
TEXT:  In other words, people re-inhabit earth on the bases of its natural abundance for human subsistence.

TEXT:  Meretz, for instance, discusses how the negotiated “mediation” of commoners collectively making decisions before production has a “structurally precautionary character” in contrast to the weak “remedial” character of production for trade via monetary exchange, as producers are obliged to act on inferences of market trends., LINE: 3392, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: instanc mediat common collect make decis product ha structur precautionari charact contrast weak remedi charact product trade via monetari exchang produc oblig act infer market trend

TEXT:  There is similar communication and negotiation on goods and services which rely on produce from neighboring or more distant communities.

TEXT:  Here “social efficiency” stands for producing what the community envisages it will need in ways that the community determines most feasible and appropriate, when and where the community thinks best. Algorithmic matching (Heidenreich this volume) is unnecessary if producing to order (ex ante versus ex post) under genuine community control; calculative apparatus can only ever provide technical supports as the community deems necessary., LINE: 3402, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: social effici stand commun need way commun feasibl appropri commun think best algorithm match volum unnecessari order ant versu post genuin commun control calcul apparatu ever provid technic support commun necessari

Thus, we the people coordinate, neither money nor a money substitute as the likes of Hayek have speculated is necessary (Kathöfer and Schröter this volume), versus Otto Neurath, who “advocated economic decisions founded on in natura calculation in kind” (O’Neill 2011: 72)., LINE: 3403, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: appropri technolog tech perspect volum ideal peopl decis make base use valu labor land need peopl planet thu peopl neither money money substitut like necessari volum versu otto econom decis calcul kind
TEXT:  In 2012, I lived and worked at Twin Oaks (Virginia, United States) and have referred to it as an example of a comparatively non-monetary community. This was not an aim of Twin Oaks but seemed, rather, to evolve in the process of achieving a serious level of co-governance and collective autonomy from mainstream pressures (read social insecurity, poverty, cultural intolerance—not to be confused with isolationism)., LINE: 3404, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: live work twin oak unit state exampl compar non monetari commun wa aim twin oak rather evolv process seriou level govern collect autonomi pressur read social insecur poverti cultur intoler confus isolation

TEXT: ” I found decision-making and conflict-resolution processes transparent and sophisticated. Privacy, individualism and diversity were respected.

TEXT: ” In contrast, the technological focus of Fleissner (this volume) highlights how capitalism has always promoted the development of machine forces, expanding the mystifying and fetishizing power of capital(ists) and diminishing labor/workers in the process (see too Braverman [1974] 1998)., LINE: 3415, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: contrast technolog focu volum highlight capit ha alway develop machin forc expand power capit labor worker process see

TEXT:  Workers “and consumers/users” thoughts, feelings and conditions are jeopardized by capitalists’ narrow definition of efficiency based on the monetary costs of production. Although Heitmann’s “having much and doing little” money-free utopias and associated guaranteed unconditional minimum income schemes (as in Aufderheide-Kohl, Aigner and Scholz-Wäckerle, and Fleissner this volume) are popular, they float curiously above the material world, seemingly ignoring the urgency of natural regeneration and healing given the very real, and overstepped, limits to earth’s bounty., LINE: 3417, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: worker consum user thought feel condit capitalist narrow definit effici base monetari cost product although much littl money free utopia associ uncondit minimum incom scheme kohl volum popular float curious materi world seemingli urgenc natur regener heal given real limit earth bounti

TEXT:  There are various questions for technological utopians. How do the “nuts and bolts” of automation fare as environmental costs? Who makes, monitors and fixes robots? Or, if they care and regenerate themselves, how do we relate to robots, and robots to us? Will our quests for direct democracy and autonomy result, instead, in the creation of an autonomous set of things or beings on which we depend for our existence? How will automation dissolve the Global North and Global South divide, and inequities more generally? How can automated work bear and bring up children who/which we might call “human”? Like Habermann (this volume) I am convinced that people, not technology, have the greatest potential to overthrow this system, which is—after all—of our own making., LINE: 3423, BOOK: Society After Money Dialogue, KEYWORD: variou question technolog utopian nut bolt fare environment cost make monitor fix robot care regener relat robot robot quest direct democraci autonomi result instead creation autonom set thing depend exist dissolv global north global south divid inequ gener work bear bring child might call human like volum convinc peopl technolog potenti overthrow system make
