TEXT: ACKNOWLEDGMENTS The Economist reminds us that “the starting point of science is collecting [data].… Then, once the collection is large enough, patterns begin to emerge” (“Exoplanets” 2017).

TEXT: MIGRATION CRISES AND THE STRUCTURE OF INTERNATIONAL COOPERATIONINTRODUCTION Migration Crises as a Lens into International Cooperation SIMA EHARAI WAS a forty-three-year-old widow with four children in Herat, Afghanistan, when she made the decision to migrate to Germany., LINE: 30, BOOK: Migration Crises and the Struct, KEYWORD: migrat crisi structur intern migrat crisi len intern sima wa forti three year old widow four child made decis migrat
TEXT:  Her eldest daughter, Sanaz, was already living in Frankfurt; her mother had managed to arrange a marriage for her to a German citizen of Afghan descent. According to her fifteen-year-old son, Redwan, she spontaneously made the decision to leave Afghanistan after watching a news report about Syrian families fleeing to Germany, which accepted them as refugees (Koelbl 2015)., LINE: 31, BOOK: Migration Crises and the Struct, KEYWORD: eldest daughter wa alreadi live mother arrang marriag german citizen descent accord fifteen year old son spontan made decis leav watch news report famili accept refuge
TEXT:  But although Afghans represent the second largest group (after Syrians) seeking asylum in Europe, the vast majority of claims are denied. In 2015 alone, 180,000 Afghans made asylum claims in Europe (Cunningham 2016), but the EU accepted just 25,915 applicants, less than 15 percent of the total (Eurostat 2016a)., LINE: 32, BOOK: Migration Crises and the Struct, KEYWORD: although repres second group seek asylum vast major claim alon made asylum claim accept applic less percent total
TEXT:  Many, like Sima, never even make it across a European border. When Sima and her three younger children left Herat in 2015, they joined the approximately three thousand people illegally crossing the border into Iran every day (Koelbl 2015)., LINE: 33, BOOK: Migration Crises and the Struct, KEYWORD: mani like sima never even make across border sima three younger child left approxim three thousand peopl illeg cross border everi day
TEXT:  Traveling by foot, they hoped to continue on to Turkey, where they could board boats to the Greek islands of Lesbos or Kos. From there, they could travel through the Balkans to Northern Europe. The family was only sixteen hours into their journey, exhausted and walking in the darkness, when Sima suddenly dropped to the ground., LINE: 34, BOOK: Migration Crises and the Struct, KEYWORD: travel foot hope continu turkey could board boat island ko could travel northern famili wa sixteen hour journey exhaust walk dark sima suddenli ground
TEXT:  When Redwan reached her, he found her head soaked with blood, although he never heard the gunshot from the Iranian border patrol that killed her. He screamed for help, but instead found himself attacked by four border guards with assault rifles; they kicked him repeatedly in the stomach as they laughed and threw his mother’s body into the back of their pickup truck., LINE: 35, BOOK: Migration Crises and the Struct, KEYWORD: found head soak blood although never gunshot border patrol help instead found four border guard assault rifl repeatedli stomach threw mother bodi back pickup truck
TEXT:  Redwan and his two younger brothers were held in a detention cell for a week before being deported back to Afghanistan with their mother’s body. Back in Herat, the orphaned children found shelter with an uncle, with eight children of his own to support; the arrangement was only temporary (Koelbl 2015)., LINE: 36, BOOK: Migration Crises and the Struct, KEYWORD: two younger brother detent cell week back mother bodi back child found shelter uncl eight child support arrang wa temporari
TEXT:  After almost fifteen years of war, the forces motivating Afghan migrants are complex. “We have nothing but war and violence here, and no work,” explained an eighteen-year-old man who hoped to leave (Koelbl 2015)., LINE: 37, BOOK: Migration Crises and the Struct, KEYWORD: almost fifteen year war forc migrant complex noth war violenc work eighteen year old man hope leav
TEXT:  Politics ground to a standstill after the 2014 presidential elections, and the international presence that has fueled the economy for years is winding down. The influx of foreigners caused wartime inflation and skyrocketing real estate prices, but this has collapsed as foreign forces and organizations have withdrawn (Koelbl 2015)., LINE: 38, BOOK: Migration Crises and the Struct, KEYWORD: polit ground standstil presidenti elect intern presenc ha economi year wind influx foreign wartim inflat real estat price ha foreign forc organ withdrawn
TEXT:  Although this was accompanied by a deteriorating security situation, including persecution and violence, as the Taliban, al-Qaeda, and even Islamic State gained ground, economic motivations are at least as powerful in stimulating migration., LINE: 39, BOOK: Migration Crises and the Struct, KEYWORD: although wa secur situat persecut violenc even state ground econom motiv least power migrat
TEXT:  While in practice these factors may be inextricably linked, there remain important legal distinctions between economic migrants and asylum seekers. For Sima, though, the distinction between the effects of the war and her status a widow and mother with no income was irrelevant., LINE: 40, BOOK: Migration Crises and the Struct, KEYWORD: practic factor may inextric link remain import legal distinct econom migrant asylum seeker sima though distinct effect war statu widow mother incom wa irrelev
TEXT:  “I can’t continue living like this,” she told her daughter during her last phone conversation with her. “Either I make it to you or I’ll follow my husband into death” (Koelbl 2015). Hamed Shurbaji, a twenty-four-year-old student studying French literature at Damascus University, attempted to reach Europe by boat twice before finally succeeding on his third, most treacherous journey., LINE: 41, BOOK: Migration Crises and the Struct, KEYWORD: continu live like told daughter last phone convers either make follow husband death twenti four year old student literatur univers reach boat twice final succeed third treacher journey
TEXT:  His route was circuitous. He first left Syria for Egypt in 2012, traveling through Lebanon, but found the situation there untenable. After forty days, he decided to head to Libya on foot, where he hoped to catch a boat to Europe., LINE: 42, BOOK: Migration Crises and the Struct, KEYWORD: rout wa circuit first left travel found situat unten forti day decid head foot hope catch boat
TEXT:  He was quickly thwarted, however, by the Libyan border patrol. After being detained for a few days, he was released and traveled to Tripoli. He spent seven months there working and saving money for his journey before engaging a smuggler who promised him passage to Europe., LINE: 43, BOOK: Migration Crises and the Struct, KEYWORD: wa quickli howev border patrol day wa travel tripoli spent seven month work save money journey engag smuggler passag
TEXT:  When the boat finally sailed, it was immediately intercepted by the Libyan coast guard, and he was again detained for a few days before being released. Discouraged but undeterred, Shurbaji paid a thousand dollars to another smuggler to secure passage on another boat., LINE: 44, BOOK: Migration Crises and the Struct, KEYWORD: boat final sail wa immedi coast guard wa day undet thousand dollar anoth smuggler secur passag anoth boat
TEXT:  This time, the boat was so overcrowded that it spent thirty hours at sea without getting anywhere; an Egyptian rescue ship eventually took the passengers back to shore. His final trip was the most overcrowded, with more than 730 people crammed on the boat, and it ended in disaster for at least some of the passengers., LINE: 45, BOOK: Migration Crises and the Struct, KEYWORD: time boat wa overcrowd spent thirti hour sea without get anywher rescu ship eventu took passeng back shore final trip wa overcrowd peopl boat end disast least passeng
TEXT:  Only hours into the journey, the craft began to take on water and sink. Over the course of the next twenty-four hours, the passengers bailed water and tried to keep it afloat. Finally, they spotted a helicopter and a Danish ship, but the situation worsened after the ship hit their much smaller boat., LINE: 46, BOOK: Migration Crises and the Struct, KEYWORD: hour journey craft take water sink cours next twenti four hour passeng water tri keep afloat final spot helicopt ship situat ship hit much smaller boat
TEXT:  People began to jump into the water, and the ensuing rescue took over five hours. Shurbaji was one of the lucky ones; thirty-nine migrants drowned (al-Muqdad 2015). Shurbaji ended up in a camp in Sicily, but he escaped and managed to continue on to Milan., LINE: 47, BOOK: Migration Crises and the Struct, KEYWORD: peopl jump water rescu took five hour wa one lucki one thirti nine migrant end camp continu
TEXT:  From there, he and a friend tried to travel to France, which they hoped would be their final destination. They were caught and turned back by French police. Back in Milan, they hired a smuggler who drove them to Germany., LINE: 48, BOOK: Migration Crises and the Struct, KEYWORD: friend tri travel hope would final destin caught turn back polic back hire smuggler drove
TEXT:  Once they arrived, Shurbaji immediately turned himself in to the local police. Three months later, he received refugee status and became a legal resident of Germany (al-Muqdad 2015). Shurbaji’s case highlights three important points., LINE: 49, BOOK: Migration Crises and the Struct, KEYWORD: immedi turn local polic three month later receiv refuge statu legal resid case highlight three import point
TEXT:  First, as in the case of Sima Eharai, individual migrants may be motivated by multiple factors. Certainly, Shurbaji fled Syria because of the ongoing war (and he had learned that he was on the government’s radar after participating in student protests in 2011)., LINE: 50, BOOK: Migration Crises and the Struct, KEYWORD: first case sima individu migrant may multipl factor certainli fled ongo war learn wa govern radar student protest
TEXT:  But he was secure in Libya, where he worked for many months before continuing on to Europe; his motivation for migrating at that point was broader than security. Second, migrants’ paths are not direct, and individuals may have contact with state authorities from several different countries along their journey; this young man traveled through (or attempted to travel to) six different countries before settling in Germany., LINE: 51, BOOK: Migration Crises and the Struct, KEYWORD: wa secur work mani month motiv point wa secur second migrant path direct individu may contact state author sever differ countri along journey young man travel travel six differ countri settl
TEXT:  He ended up there through a combination of state policies and his own preferences. Although his first-choice destination was France, he was effectively repelled by French police and chose Germany as a secondary option because of its opportunities and more open asylum policies., LINE: 52, BOOK: Migration Crises and the Struct, KEYWORD: end combin state polici prefer although first choic destin wa wa effect polic chose secondari option opportun open asylum polici
TEXT:  Third, Shurbaji’s experience may have been very different had he arrived in Germany a few years later. Until November 2015, almost all Syrians (and Iraqis and Eritreans) arriving in Germany were granted full refugee status, which provided residence rights in Germany for at least three years, generous welfare benefits, and the right to have family members join them., LINE: 53, BOOK: Migration Crises and the Struct, KEYWORD: third experi may differ year later almost full refuge statu provid resid right least three year gener welfar benefit right famili member join
TEXT:  Then, in November 2015, the interior ministry announced that all successful applicants would be offered only “subsidiary protection”—temporary protection for a year with no right to family reunification., LINE: 54, BOOK: Migration Crises and the Struct, KEYWORD: interior ministri success applic would subsidiari protect temporari protect year right famili reunif
TEXT:  This announcement was followed by some confusion as the Social Democrats, junior partners in the ruling coalition government, denied the change (Traynor 2015). By January 2016, however, the government reached an agreement and implemented the new policy, which it hoped would bring the country more in line with other European states (Deutsche Welle 2016)., LINE: 55, BOOK: Migration Crises and the Struct, KEYWORD: announc wa confus social democrat junior partner rule coalit govern chang howev govern agreement new polici hope would bring countri line state
TEXT:  The relatively generous policies meant that refugees were choosing Germany over neighboring states. Migrants like Hamed Shurbaji may be treated very dissimilarly by different governments at various points, even as states fulfill basic obligations under the refugee regime, which recognizes variations in temporary protection as legitimate (Orchard and Miller 2014; Ostrand 2015)., LINE: 56, BOOK: Migration Crises and the Struct, KEYWORD: rel gener polici meant refuge choos neighbor state migrant like may dissimilarli differ govern variou point even state fulfil basic oblig refuge regim variat temporari protect legitim orchard miller
TEXT:  In 2015, more than half a million migrants had arrived in Germany by late September. Of these, about half had already applied for asylum, and 42 percent of these asylum seekers came not from Syria or Afghanistan but from Europe (Bennhold 2015)., LINE: 57, BOOK: Migration Crises and the Struct, KEYWORD: half million migrant late half alreadi appli asylum percent asylum seeker came
TEXT:  Albanians, Kosovars, Macedonians, and Serbians joined with the flood of migrants from far more dangerous places in hopes of both blending in and taking advantage of the new services established to help refugees., LINE: 58, BOOK: Migration Crises and the Struct, KEYWORD: flood migrant far danger place hope blend take advantag new servic establish help refuge
TEXT:  The new stream was also facilitated by Serbia’s relaxation of travel restrictions on Kosovars in September 2015. In the late 1990s, tens of thousands of refugees flooded into the European Union from Serbia, escaping the war in Kosovo., LINE: 59, BOOK: Migration Crises and the Struct, KEYWORD: new stream wa also relax travel restrict late ten thousand refuge flood union war
TEXT:  In 2015, however, the “refugees” fled corruption and hopelessness, not war. With unemployment hovering around 35 percent (60 percent among young people) and 30 percent of the population living below the poverty line, Kosovars in particular felt that they were refugees, “forced” to flee, even if they failed to meet the legal requirements., LINE: 60, BOOK: Migration Crises and the Struct, KEYWORD: howev refuge fled corrupt hopeless war unemploy hover around percent percent among young peopl percent popul live poverti line particular felt refuge forc flee even meet legal requir
TEXT:  The belief was fueled by stories of friends and family who had reached the EU successfully, and by rumors that Germany had an “open door” policy, provided four thousand euros upon arrival, and was looking for Kosovars to work., LINE: 61, BOOK: Migration Crises and the Struct, KEYWORD: belief wa stori friend famili success rumor open door polici provid four thousand upon arriv wa look work
TEXT:  These rumors are often propagated by smugglers who transport migrants across the Serbian border to Hungary for as little as two hundred fifty euros. From there, migrants either file an asylum claim in Hungary, if they are arrested, or continue on to another country in the Schengen Area; most travel to Germany and file claims there (Chick 2015)., LINE: 62, BOOK: Migration Crises and the Struct, KEYWORD: rumor often smuggler transport migrant across border littl two hundr fifti migrant either file asylum claim continu anoth countri area travel file claim chick
TEXT:  Asylum applications from Kosovars in Germany increased by 572 percent between January 2014 and January 2015 (Ott 2015).

TEXT:  By mid-March, he had been living at a refugee center in Augsburg, Germany, for about a month, waiting for his claim to be processed. Confident that he would receive refugee status, he was surprised to learn that most Kosovars are rejected and repatriated (less than one-half of one percent of Kosovars are accepted)., LINE: 64, BOOK: Migration Crises and the Struct, KEYWORD: mid march live refuge center month wait claim confid would receiv refuge statu wa learn less one half one percent accept
TEXT:  “Dreams stay dreams in Kosovo,” explained Haziro. “There is no perspective and people have given up hope that things will change. Germany is the promised land.

TEXT:  There are undoubtedly other migrant crises that do not reach the front page of the New York Times.

There are three main points., LINE: 71, BOOK: Migration Crises and the Struct, KEYWORD: undoubtedli migrant crisi reach front page new york time migrant crisi tell intern migrat role intern migrat issu three main point
TEXT:  First, this international flow is decidedly different from other types of international flows. Other international economic flows can affect economies and people in many ways, destroying employment and displacing some residents even as they also enrich others., LINE: 72, BOOK: Migration Crises and the Struct, KEYWORD: first intern flow decidedli differ type intern flow intern econom flow affect economi peopl mani way employ resid even also enrich
TEXT:  But trade in goods and services and international capital flows represent inanimate objects.

TEXT:  Because humans are involved, it is all the more important to understand how these crises can be resolved. The second point is that a refugee regime exists that permits states to sort individuals into refugees and voluntary, or economic, migrants, regardless of the motives or perceptions of the migrants themselves., LINE: 74, BOOK: Migration Crises and the Struct, KEYWORD: human involv import understand crisi resolv second point refuge regim permit state sort individu refuge voluntari econom migrant regardless motif percept migrant
TEXT:  As elaborated in the UN Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees, only specific types of individual persecution qualify individuals for refugee status, and states are also often unwilling to accept applicants if they have found an initial refuge., LINE: 75, BOOK: Migration Crises and the Struct, KEYWORD: convent statu refuge specif type individu persecut qualifi individu refuge statu state also often unwil accept applic found initi refug
TEXT:  Thus, even though many would consider the migrants seeking entry into Europe and elsewhere to be refugees, or “forced” migrants, most actually fall into the legal category of “voluntary” migrants. The third point is that migrant crises serve as exogenous shocks that modify the costs of the status quo for states in the international system, propelling them to the bargaining table in search of solutions., LINE: 76, BOOK: Migration Crises and the Struct, KEYWORD: thu even though mani would consid migrant seek entri elsewher refuge forc migrant actual fall legal categori voluntari migrant third point migrant crisi serv exogen shock modifi cost statu quo state intern system tabl search solut

TEXT:  THEORETICAL CLAIMS Our first claim is that the patterns of international migration in the post–World War II period help us understand the shape of international cooperation on migration. The patterns have been predominantly unidirectional, from poorer, less stable countries to wealthier, more stable countries., LINE: 80, BOOK: Migration Crises and the Struct, KEYWORD: theoret claim first claim pattern intern migrat post world war period help understand shape intern migrat pattern predominantli unidirect less stabl countri stabl countri
TEXT:  Stability and wealth are relative. There are many countries in the Global South that are destinations for international migrants, in addition to wealthy Western democracies. Moreover, the patterns are unique to specific host countries—Canada attracts different flows than does the United States; migrants to the United Kingdom are distinctive from those to Germany; South Africa’s migrants come from different countries of origin than those in Malaysia., LINE: 81, BOOK: Migration Crises and the Struct, KEYWORD: stabil wealth rel mani countri global south destin intern migrant addit wealthi western democraci moreov pattern uniqu specif host countri canada differ flow doe unit state migrant unit kingdom distinct south migrant come differ countri origin
TEXT:  The pattern of the flows is important because it suggests that the externalities associated with the flows affect only the specific pair of countries, the country of origin and the country of destination., LINE: 82, BOOK: Migration Crises and the Struct, KEYWORD: pattern flow import extern associ flow affect specif pair countri countri origin countri destin
TEXT:  Hence, bargaining over the externalities is likely to be bilateral rather than regional or multilateral. International cooperation on migration is more likely to resemble not the multilateral World Trade Organization but the bilateral investment treaties that characterize the international investment regime between the Global North and the Global South., LINE: 83, BOOK: Migration Crises and the Struct, KEYWORD: henc extern like bilater rather region multilater intern migrat like resembl multilater world trade organ bilater invest treati character intern invest regim global north global south
TEXT:  There is a caveat to our generalization connecting the pattern of flows to the structure of cooperation. Where flows have the potential to be reciprocal, where economic conditions are similar, as in the case of the European Union, there is the potential for regional agreements on migration that underpin freedom of movement (United Nations Development Programme [UNDP] 2009)., LINE: 84, BOOK: Migration Crises and the Struct, KEYWORD: caveat gener pattern flow structur flow potenti reciproc econom condit similar case union potenti region agreement migrat underpin freedom movement unit nation develop
TEXT:  Our second claim is that the status quo ante and the distribution of power in the international system help explain the paucity of international cooperation on migration. The status quo is one that divides the world into “sending” and “receiving” countries and, in most instances, privileges receiving countries., LINE: 85, BOOK: Migration Crises and the Struct, KEYWORD: second claim statu quo ant distribut power intern system help explain pauciti intern migrat statu quo one divid world send countri instanc privileg countri
TEXT:  According to international law, states have sovereignty over the admission of foreigners and, therefore, determine which applicants to admit and which to reject, subject to treaty commitments to not refoule (turn away) genuine refugees., LINE: 86, BOOK: Migration Crises and the Struct, KEYWORD: accord intern law state sovereignti admiss foreign therefor determin applic admit reject subject treati commit turn away genuin refuge
TEXT:  It also permits receiving states to discriminate between citizen and noncitizen residents, subject to human rights treaty commitments. At the same time, international law requires that states permit their citizens to leave their country of origin and to readmit their citizens upon return., LINE: 87, BOOK: Migration Crises and the Struct, KEYWORD: also permit state discrimin citizen noncitizen resid subject human right treati commit time intern law state permit citizen leav countri origin readmit citizen upon return
TEXT:  This status quo privileges receiving states by allowing them to determine the level and type of immigrants they receive as well as the set of rights to provide the immigrants upon arrival. Since receiving states prefer the status quo in most instances, they are unlikely to engage in negotiations that reduce their privileges., LINE: 88, BOOK: Migration Crises and the Struct, KEYWORD: statu quo privileg state determin level type immigr receiv well set right provid immigr upon arriv sinc state prefer statu quo instanc unlik engag negoti reduc privileg
TEXT:  And sending states, because they are poorer and less stable, are unlikely to have sufficient resources to persuade receiving states to negotiate over admissions and treatment of immigrants. Our third claim is that the cost of the status quo for receiving states is subject to exogenous pressure or shocks., LINE: 89, BOOK: Migration Crises and the Struct, KEYWORD: send state less stabl unlik suffici resourc persuad state negoti admiss treatment immigr third claim cost statu quo state subject exogen pressur shock
TEXT:  When that raises the costs of the status quo, receiving states may seek to negotiate an agreement that provides for international cooperation. The terms are affected by the bargaining power of the parties within the context of the negotiations., LINE: 90, BOOK: Migration Crises and the Struct, KEYWORD: rais cost statu quo state may seek negoti agreement intern term affect power parti within context negoti
TEXT:  One source of bargaining power is the range of available outside options or “best alternative to a negotiated agreement.” The distribution of benefits from international cooperation is largely determined by the attractiveness of the outside options., LINE: 91, BOOK: Migration Crises and the Struct, KEYWORD: one sourc power rang avail outsid option best altern agreement distribut benefit intern larg determin attract outsid option
TEXT:  Those states whose outside options are limited are more eager to reach agreement and make greater concessions than those whose outside options are better. Exogenous shocks, such as migrant crises, can alter the available outside options and thus explain why states might resort to international cooperation, but migrant crises are not the sole trigger., LINE: 92, BOOK: Migration Crises and the Struct, KEYWORD: state whose outsid option limit eager reach agreement make greater concess whose outsid option better exogen shock migrant crisi alter avail outsid option thu explain state might resort intern migrant crisi sole trigger
TEXT:  Domestic political actors or international nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) might also create costs that pressure a government into seeking international negotiations on migration. Our fourth claim focuses on the institutional forums in which the negotiations take place., LINE: 93, BOOK: Migration Crises and the Struct, KEYWORD: domest polit actor intern nongovernment organ might also creat cost pressur govern seek intern negoti migrat fourth claim focu institut forum negoti take place
TEXT:  If sending states prefer an alternative to the status quo and if the chosen institution privileges sending states (countries of origin), then sending states may negotiate agreements that reflect their preferences., LINE: 94, BOOK: Migration Crises and the Struct, KEYWORD: send state prefer altern statu quo chosen institut privileg send state countri origin send state may negoti agreement reflect prefer
TEXT:  However, even where a treaty is negotiated, sending states usually lack the power to persuade receiving states to ratify it. So this avenue may not be very productive. Finally, the term “international cooperation” tends to take on a normative hue that suggests greater openness to the international system., LINE: 95, BOOK: Migration Crises and the Struct, KEYWORD: howev even treati send state usual lack power persuad state ratifi avenu may product final term intern take norm hue greater open intern system
TEXT:  In migration, at least, cooperation can, and often does, lead to the reduction of migratory flows. States that agree to cooperate on international migration often do so to minimize the number of individuals crossing international boundaries., LINE: 96, BOOK: Migration Crises and the Struct, KEYWORD: migrat least often doe lead reduct migratori flow state agre intern migrat often minim number individu cross intern boundari
TEXT:  This contradicts, rather than supports, the ideals of a liberal world order. As with all theories, our claims are probabilistic and we neither seek nor claim to explain every state activity involving voluntary international migration., LINE: 97, BOOK: Migration Crises and the Struct, KEYWORD: rather support ideal liber world order theori claim probabilist neither seek claim explain everi state activ voluntari intern migrat
TEXT:  Theories always abstract from the details of reality in order to sketch underlying patterns. Nonetheless, we provide a considerable amount of evidence that is consistent with our theoretical claims. Our theory attempts to explain when states will enter negotiations on international migration, the shape that cooperation takes, and the outcomes of the negotiations in terms of which states gain and lose from the negotiations., LINE: 98, BOOK: Migration Crises and the Struct, KEYWORD: theori alway abstract detail realiti order sketch underli pattern nonetheless provid consider amount evid consist theoret claim theori attempt explain state enter negoti intern migrat shape take outcom negoti term state gain lose negoti

TEXT:  The theoretical literature on international cooperation is rich, but it is challenging to evaluate empirically.

TEXT:  This neglect of the “null cases” and selection on the dependent variable of cooperation increases the risk of mistaken conclusions about the causes of cooperation (Geddes 1991). We overcome this limitation by surveying all of the issue areas associated with international migration., LINE: 101, BOOK: Migration Crises and the Struct, KEYWORD: neglect null case select depend variabl increas risk mistaken conclus caus overcom limit survey issu area associ intern migrat
TEXT:  Our empirical work on migration illuminates four lessons for those interested in international cooperation more broadly. The first lesson is that patterns of interactions may be important for the degree of inclusiveness in international negotiations., LINE: 102, BOOK: Migration Crises and the Struct, KEYWORD: empir work migrat four lesson interest intern broadli first lesson pattern interact may import degre inclus intern negoti
TEXT:  We know that international agreements can be bilateral, regional, and multilateral; our research supplements what is known about the shape of international cooperation (Koremenos, Lipson, and Snidal 2001; Verdier 2008; Thompson and Verdier 2014)., LINE: 103, BOOK: Migration Crises and the Struct, KEYWORD: know intern agreement bilater region multilater research supplement known shape intern

TEXT:  We argue, however, that the patterns of flows may be important for explaining cooperation in other arenas as well, from capital to arms flows. The second is that, in the international system, it may be difficult to predict when cooperation will take place as it is driven in part by exogenous shocks that researchers are unable to predict., LINE: 105, BOOK: Migration Crises and the Struct, KEYWORD: argu howev pattern flow may import explain arena well capit arm flow second intern system may difficult predict take place driven part exogen shock research unabl predict
TEXT:  Being alert to these changes in the status quo when they do occur means that researchers may be better equipped to identify the moments when cooperation is most likely to succeed. Policymakers and activists pursuing cooperation can use this information to time their efforts to coincide with the ideal moment., LINE: 106, BOOK: Migration Crises and the Struct, KEYWORD: alert chang statu quo occur mean research may better identifi moment like succeed activist use inform time effort coincid ideal moment
TEXT:  The third lesson is already well established but worth repeating: the normal trappings of power in the international system do not always predict the outcomes of international bargaining. However, the distribution of power in the international system continues to play an important role given the current status quo., LINE: 107, BOOK: Migration Crises and the Struct, KEYWORD: third lesson alreadi well establish worth normal trap power intern system alway predict outcom intern howev distribut power intern system play import role given current statu quo
TEXT:  As institutionalization of the international system progresses, there may be more opportunities for groups of states to use the rules of international institutions to propose and pass treaties addressing any number of issues beyond migration., LINE: 108, BOOK: Migration Crises and the Struct, KEYWORD: intern system progress may opportun group state use rule intern institut propos treati number issu beyond migrat
TEXT:  Without support from traditionally powerful states, however, these new treaties will remain poorly ratified and unenforced. Finally, as the record of cooperation on migration illustrates, international cooperation will not necessarily facilitate the neoliberal dream of fewer international barriers and more openness., LINE: 109, BOOK: Migration Crises and the Struct, KEYWORD: without support tradit power state howev new treati remain poorli unenforc final record migrat intern necessarili facilit dream intern barrier open

TEXT:  ORGANIZATION OF THE BOOK To substantiate our claims, we begin in chapter 1 by delineating the domain of our theory and explaining how the term “voluntary migration,” although ambiguous, fairly describes the vast majority of individuals who live outside their country of birth and that attention to international cooperation on voluntary migration is appropriate., LINE: 111, BOOK: Migration Crises and the Struct, KEYWORD: organ book substanti claim begin chapter domain theori explain term voluntari migrat although ambigu fairli vast major individu live outsid countri birth attent intern voluntari migrat appropri
TEXT:  We then describe the pattern of migratory flows in the post–World War II period and show how these patterns are expected to affect the shape of international cooperation. In chapter 2, we adopt a bargaining framework to explain both stasis and change in the degree of cooperation in the international system on migration issues., LINE: 112, BOOK: Migration Crises and the Struct, KEYWORD: describ pattern migratori flow post world war period show pattern affect shape intern chapter adopt framework explain stasi chang degre intern system migrat issu
TEXT:  We explain our choice of states as the central unit of analysis and our division of states into two types—receiving and sending.

TEXT:  If powerful states prefer the status quo, we predict that international negotiations will not ensue. There are two conditions under which we predict the initiation of international negotiations—when exogenous pressure or shocks modify the costs of the status quo for states and hence bring countries that would otherwise be resistant to the bargaining table, and when the less powerful sending states can exploit their institutional power in forums that advantage their numbers., LINE: 114, BOOK: Migration Crises and the Struct, KEYWORD: power state prefer statu quo predict intern negoti ensu two condit predict initi intern negoti exogen pressur shock modifi cost statu quo state henc bring countri would otherwis resist tabl less power send state exploit institut power forum advantag number
TEXT:  Finally, we show how external power and internal, bargaining power affect the negotiated outcomes. In the first instance, where flows are unidirectional, sending states are able to leverage their bargaining power to extract concessions from receiving states; where flows are reciprocal, states may choose freedom of movement., LINE: 115, BOOK: Migration Crises and the Struct, KEYWORD: final show extern power intern power affect outcom first instanc flow unidirect send state abl leverag power extract concess state flow reciproc state may choos freedom movement
TEXT:  In the second instance, multilateral treaties may be negotiated but sending states lack the resources to persuade receiving states to ratify the resulting treaty and the treaty is ineffective. In chapters 3 to 7, we take up issues central to international migration: restricting immigrant flows through internal immigration control; facilitating immigrant flows, which takes the forms of bilateral recruitment and freedom of movement; law enforcement to reduce criminality; and immigrant rights., LINE: 116, BOOK: Migration Crises and the Struct, KEYWORD: second instanc multilater treati may send state lack resourc persuad state ratifi result treati treati ineffect chapter take issu central intern migrat immigr flow intern immigr control immigr flow take form bilater recruit freedom movement law enforc reduc crimin immigr right

TEXT:  The distribution of power allows us to predict the outcomes of the negotiations. We follow with evidence that is consistent with our predictions. Finally, we explore alternative explanations of the same phenomenon and demonstrate that our explanation is at least as good as alternative theories and provides additional insights into the timing, shape, and contents of the agreement., LINE: 119, BOOK: Migration Crises and the Struct, KEYWORD: distribut power predict outcom negoti follow evid consist predict final explor altern explan phenomenon demonstr explan least good altern theori addit insight time shape content agreement

TEXT:  MIGRANT CRISES AND MIGRANT PROTECTIONS Our interest in international cooperation on migration stems in part from the intensely human story of international migration.

TEXT:  The European migrant crisis also represents the failure of existing national and international institutions to respond to large-scale violence and inequalities around the globe.

TEXT:  Migrants, in many ways, are the canaries in the coal mines, warning that all is not well.

TEXT:  The story of human history is in part a story of migration; understanding how we respond to it, facilitate it, and manage it is crucially important. Migrants have many advocates, including themselves, who petition to help ensure that individuals, resident outside their country of birth, are able to live with dignity and access to resources., LINE: 132, BOOK: Migration Crises and the Struct, KEYWORD: stori human histori part stori migrat understand respond facilit manag crucial import migrant mani advoc petit help ensur individu resid outsid countri birth abl live digniti access resourc

TEXT:  Advocates need to employ their resources where they can best achieve their goals.

TEXT:  Yet there is little agreement among scholars about whether there is no regime at all (Hollifield 2000; UNDP 2009), or whether efforts to manage international migration privilege wealthy and powerful countries in the international system (Lindley 2011), or whether there exists a “tapestry” of different kinds of cooperation depending on the type of collective action problem that arises (Betts 2011)., LINE: 138, BOOK: Migration Crises and the Struct, KEYWORD: yet littl agreement among scholar whether regim whether effort manag intern migrat privileg wealthi power countri intern system whether tapestri differ kind depend type collect action problem

TEXT:  A single theoretical framework can account for the varying patterns of international cooperation on voluntary migration. We present this framework in two chapters.

TEXT:  We begin by addressing some definitional issues that help clarify the scope of our research: the definition of voluntary migration, the role of the state as the central actor in international cooperation, and the distinctiveness of migration as an international economic flow., LINE: 144, BOOK: Migration Crises and the Struct, KEYWORD: begin definit issu help clarifi scope research definit voluntari migrat role state central actor intern distinct migrat intern econom flow
TEXT:  We then outline a central theoretical lens, how the possibilities for cooperation are shaped by the unidirectional and unique patterns of voluntary migration. These patterns limit cooperation because the lack of reciprocity reduces an important element of cooperative behavior in the international system and because the pattern of flows generates externalities or market failures that are dyadic rather than regional or global in scope., LINE: 145, BOOK: Migration Crises and the Struct, KEYWORD: outlin central theoret len possibl shape unidirect uniqu pattern voluntari migrat pattern limit lack reciproc import element behavior intern system pattern flow extern market failur dyadic rather region global scope
TEXT:  In chapter 2, we introduce a bargaining framework that allows us to hypothesize about the conditions under which states may cooperate on migration issues. VOLUNTARY MIGRATION Our focus is on voluntary migration., LINE: 146, BOOK: Migration Crises and the Struct, KEYWORD: chapter introduc framework hypothes condit state may migrat issu voluntari migrat focu voluntari migrat
TEXT:  As noted in our introduction, this focus presumes a clear distinction between “voluntary” and “forced” migration, yet we know that migrants often have multiple motives for moving and that the legal definition of “refugee,” found in the UN Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees, is so narrow as to leave many migrants unprotected from violence and other threats to their existence., LINE: 147, BOOK: Migration Crises and the Struct, KEYWORD: note introduct focu clear distinct voluntari forc migrat yet know migrant often multipl motif move legal definit refuge found convent statu refuge narrow leav mani migrant unprotect violenc threat exist

TEXT:  This question is important in part because the vast majority of individuals living outside their country of birth are defined as voluntary migrants. The UNDP reports that in 2008, of the approximately two hundred million migrants—those living for more than one year outside their country of origin—only around fifteen million were classified as refugees (UNDP 2009)., LINE: 153, BOOK: Migration Crises and the Struct, KEYWORD: question import part vast major individu live outsid countri birth defin voluntari migrant report approxim two hundr million migrant live one year outsid countri origin around fifteen million classifi refuge

TEXT: 3 In order to make sense of the underlying structure of international cooperation, we focus our lens on the regime for voluntary migration. However, the entire picture of “global migration governance,” according to Rey Koslowski (2011a), can be divided into three subregimes: the travel or mobility regime, the voluntary migration regime, and the forced migration or refugee regime., LINE: 155, BOOK: Migration Crises and the Struct, KEYWORD: order make sens underli structur intern focu len regim voluntari migrat howev entir pictur global migrat govern accord divid three travel mobil regim voluntari migrat regim forc migrat refuge regim

TEXT:  The refugee regime is defined by the UN Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees (1951) and subsequent protocol (1967) and is monitored by the UN High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR). In the conclusions, we point to characteristics of refugee and travel flows that are distinctive from voluntary migration and suggest modifications to our theoretical framework to account for different patterns of international cooperation in these migration subregimes, particularly the refugee regime., LINE: 157, BOOK: Migration Crises and the Struct, KEYWORD: refuge regim defin convent statu refuge subsequ protocol high commission refuge conclus point characterist refuge travel flow distinct voluntari migrat suggest modif theoret framework account differ pattern intern migrat particularli refuge regim
TEXT:  MIGRATION AS A UNIQUE INTERNATIONAL FLOW International cooperation forms a generic research agenda for scholars of international relations.

TEXT:  Migration and Identity Politics. Although migration and other international economic flows share a number of commonalities, migration has several distinct dimensions as well. One distinctive element may be related to the fact that migrants are individuals with their own cultures, customs, and languages, so the politics of migration often involve identity., LINE: 160, BOOK: Migration Crises and the Struct, KEYWORD: migrat ident polit although migrat intern econom flow share number common migrat ha sever distinct dimens well one distinct element may relat fact migrant individu cultur custom languag polit migrat often involv ident

TEXT:  It is also true that some migrants disrupt some members of the society in which they choose to live and work. Yet societal disruption is also a common feature of trade and capital flows.

TEXT: 10 While it is true that the size of the bundle may vary, Ruhs and Chang make a convincing argument that migration is distinctive from other international economic flows because these rights change the equation of costs and benefits of migration., LINE: 174, BOOK: Migration Crises and the Struct, KEYWORD: true size bundl may vari chang make convinc argument migrat distinct intern econom flow right chang equat cost benefit migrat
TEXT:  Although we believe this observation is accurate, we do not believe that this distinction is crucial to the prospects for international cooperation.

TEXT:  Migration Externalities. Alexander Betts (2011) has pointed out that migration generates externalities in the international system, as have Sandra Lavenex and Emek Uçarer (2002). Externalities are defined as costs and/or benefits that accrue to individuals or groups who did not choose to incur them., LINE: 177, BOOK: Migration Crises and the Struct, KEYWORD: migrat extern ha point migrat extern intern system extern defin cost benefit accru individu group choos incur
TEXT:  Robert Keohane (1984), in After Hegemony, employs the concept of externalities to construct a neofunctionalist model of international cooperation. In essence, externalities generate problems of collective action for those subject to the externality, prompting cooperation among states to overcome the costs through bargaining with the generator of the externality., LINE: 178, BOOK: Migration Crises and the Struct, KEYWORD: hegemoni employ concept extern construct model intern essenc extern gener problem collect action subject extern among state overcom cost gener extern

TEXT:  However, he relies on the notion that externalities affect more than a single actor, creating problems of collective action.

TEXT:  We argue that the patterns of migration in the postwar period have not, for the most part, generated collective externalities (also see Lockhart and Money 2011). MIGRATION PATTERNS BETWEEN SENDING AND RECEIVING STATES So, what are the barriers to international cooperation in international migration? We argue that migration patterns in the post–World War II era are characterized by both nonreciprocity and unique receiving country patterns (UNDP 2009; Hatton 2007)., LINE: 182, BOOK: Migration Crises and the Struct, KEYWORD: argu pattern migrat postwar period part collect extern also see money migrat pattern send state barrier intern intern migrat argu migrat pattern post world war era nonreciproc uniqu countri pattern

TEXT:  However, barring state barriers to egress and entry, the general pattern in the contemporary era is from poorer and less stable states to wealthier and more stable states (UNDP 2009).

TEXT:  This means that when a state refuses to cooperate, it is punished in the next move. However, should it cooperate in the future, then forgiveness is demonstrated and allows cooperation to ensue. The WTO, for example, has created a decentralized enforcement mechanism that allows states whose economies have been hurt by unfair trade practices to retaliate against the trade of the opposing state., LINE: 202, BOOK: Migration Crises and the Struct, KEYWORD: mean state refus next move howev futur forgiv ensu exampl ha enforc mechan state whose economi hurt unfair trade practic retali trade oppos state

TEXT:  We have not traced empirically the patterns of emigration from source countries, but those profiles would be distinctive as well. BILATERALISM Having established empirically that patterns of migration flows are predominantly unilateral and unique, we provide the logic that connects these flows to bilateralism as an institutional design choice., LINE: 219, BOOK: Migration Crises and the Struct, KEYWORD: pattern emigr sourc countri profil would distinct well bilater establish pattern migrat flow predominantli unilater uniqu provid logic flow bilater institut design choic
TEXT:  The literature on institutional design is surprisingly thin on the conditions under which states choose bilateral versus multilateral institutions.20 Alexander Thompson and Daniel Verdier (2014) speak directly to the choice between multilateral and bilateral treaties by juxtaposing the costs associated with each type of agreement., LINE: 220, BOOK: Migration Crises and the Struct, KEYWORD: literatur institut design surprisingli thin condit state choos bilater versu multilater institut speak directli choic multilater bilater treati cost associ type agreement
TEXT:  Bilateral treaties generate higher transactions costs as each state is required to bargain with every other state.

TEXT:  Because a principle of multilateralism is to treat each member in an identical fashion, the terms of the agreement correspond to the compliance costs of the member with the highest compliance costs. Members with lower compliance costs receive benefits that exceed their costs and, hence, experience a surplus., LINE: 223, BOOK: Migration Crises and the Struct, KEYWORD: principl treat member ident fashion term agreement correspond complianc cost member highest complianc cost member lower complianc cost receiv benefit exceed cost henc experi surplu
TEXT:  Bilateralism provides tailored agreements that reduce the costs of the side payments but requires the hegemon to negotiate multiple agreements, increasing transaction costs. According to Thompson and Verdier, it is this trade-off that states must evaluate when deciding on a multilateral or bilateral agreement format., LINE: 224, BOOK: Migration Crises and the Struct, KEYWORD: bilater agreement reduc cost side payment hegemon negoti multipl agreement increas transact cost accord trade state must evalu multilater bilater agreement format

TEXT:  Receiving states prefer to minimize side payments when seeking international cooperation. Multilateral agreements increase side payments through two mechanisms. The first mechanism is the higher side payments to all members of the agreement, based on the compliance costs of the highest cost member., LINE: 226, BOOK: Migration Crises and the Struct, KEYWORD: state prefer minim side payment seek intern multilater agreement increas side payment two mechan first mechan higher side payment member agreement base complianc cost highest cost member
TEXT:  For example, in creating a multilateral agreement on migration, France would have to provide the same side payments to Algeria, Morocco, and Tunisia, when their compliance costs could be very different., LINE: 227, BOOK: Migration Crises and the Struct, KEYWORD: exampl multilater agreement migrat would provid side payment morocco complianc cost could differ
TEXT:  The second mechanism that increases costs is the number of states to which France would have to supply side payments.

TEXT:  There would be no reason for France to include Botswana or Argentina in a multilateral migration agreement. The organizers of the migration regime want to minimize the size of these payments. Given that the issues generated by migration involve a distinctive profile of states for each receiving state and involve a limited number of states, bilateral agreements, even though they involve transaction costs, are cheaper than multilateral agreements., LINE: 229, BOOK: Migration Crises and the Struct, KEYWORD: would reason includ multilater migrat agreement organ migrat regim want minim size payment given issu migrat involv distinct profil state state involv limit number state bilater agreement even though involv transact cost multilater agreement

TEXT:  What we add is that the pattern of flows helps clarify how regime support costs are generated and shape the costs and benefits of institutional choice. Because the patterns are dominated by unidirectional and unique flows from sending states to receiving states, the externalities associated with the flows are bilateral., LINE: 231, BOOK: Migration Crises and the Struct, KEYWORD: add pattern flow help clarifi regim support cost shape cost benefit institut choic pattern domin unidirect uniqu flow send state state extern associ flow bilater

TEXT:  In our analysis of criminality in international migration, we find that regime effectiveness requires global membership and the regime organizer, the United States, preferred the lowered transaction costs of a multilateral regime, even though this increased the regime support costs., LINE: 234, BOOK: Migration Crises and the Struct, KEYWORD: analysi crimin intern migrat find regim effect global membership regim organ unit state prefer transact cost multilater regim even though regim support cost

TEXT:  In these instances, there is the potential for cooperation that facilitates the movement of migrants across international boundaries. There are few examples of this historically, so we anticipate that the conditions under which migration flows will be reciprocal are rare: they include the Nordic Common Labor Market (including members of the Nordic Union, Sweden, Finland, Norway, Iceland, and Denmark), the Benelux Free Labor Movement Agreement (including Belgium, the Netherlands, and Luxembourg), and the best known example, the European Union., LINE: 237, BOOK: Migration Crises and the Struct, KEYWORD: instanc potenti movement migrant across intern boundari exampl histor anticip condit migrat flow reciproc rare includ common labor market member union finland iceland free labor movement agreement best known exampl union

TEXT: 21 We employ the same bargaining framework for this type of cooperation: states prefer the status quo until exogenous shocks or pressures generate costs that bring the parties to the bargaining table, but power is not a central component of the bargain., LINE: 240, BOOK: Migration Crises and the Struct, KEYWORD: employ framework type state prefer statu quo exogen shock pressur gener cost bring parti tabl power central compon bargain
TEXT:  Under these circumstances, we anticipate the presence of bilateral or regional agreements for free labor movement.

TEXT:  The lack of international institutions in an era of human rights promotion and global governance is puzzling, especially since many other international flows are governed by international regimes. Although many researchers argue, and we agree, that migration is distinctive from many other international flows, we do not believe that these distinctions account for the lack of international cooperation., LINE: 244, BOOK: Migration Crises and the Struct, KEYWORD: lack intern institut era human right promot global govern puzzl especi sinc mani intern flow intern regim although mani research argu agre migrat distinct mani intern flow believ distinct account lack intern
TEXT:  We have described the structure of voluntary migration flows in the past sixty years and have argued that the structure of the flows shapes the costs of regime support.

TEXT:  To minimize the costs of regime support, bilateralism is the most cost-effective structure.

We do add three caveats., LINE: 246, BOOK: Migration Crises and the Struct, KEYWORD: minim cost regim support bilater cost effect structur hypothes instanc doe occur like bilater form add three caveat
TEXT:  First, where patterns are reciprocal and states have similar migration profiles, other institutional arrangements may be more cost-effective.

TEXT:  However, migration crises and other pressures may change the cost of the status quo for powerful states, giving rise to international negotiations on migration.

TEXT:  Hence, the status quo ante is a privileged solution. We argue that there are two mechanisms that bring states to the negotiating table and structure the outcome of the negotiations.

TEXT:  However, there are two reasons to focus specifically on agreements between states as the locus of our theoretical and empirical inquiry.

TEXT:  It is also true that migration is often a domestically charged political issue and that domestic actors have positions on the level and type of migration desired (both immigration and emigration).

In the absence of such work, we look to the economic consequences of migration on domestic political actors and argue that these appear to be indifferent to the shape of the state’s political institutions., LINE: 295, BOOK: Migration Crises and the Struct, KEYWORD: littl work variat prefer migrat democraci autocraci absenc work look econom consequ migrat domest polit actor argu appear indiffer shape state polit institut
TEXT:  The largest benefits from migration accrue to employers in the host state and to the migrants themselves, as employers have access to a cheaper and more pliable labor force and the migrants receive higher wages than they could accrue in their home state (Castles, de Haas, and Miller 2014)., LINE: 296, BOOK: Migration Crises and the Struct, KEYWORD: benefit migrat accru employ host state migrant employ access pliabl labor forc migrant receiv higher wage could accru home state castl miller
TEXT:  The impact on labor in the home and host states depends in large part on the degree to which local labor is insulated from foreign labor (Piore 1979) and the incorporation of domestic political actors’ policy preferences into the state’s decision calculus based on the economic consequences of the policy on domestic groups., LINE: 297, BOOK: Migration Crises and the Struct, KEYWORD: impact labor home host state larg part degre local labor insul foreign labor incorpor domest polit actor polici prefer state decis calculu base econom consequ polici domest group
TEXT:  For example, the trade literature refers to import-competing versus export-oriented economic sectors as potentially important actors in determining the level of international cooperation on trade. We do not dispute the underlying theoretical framework but argue that, for migration issues, democracies do not differ systematically from autocracies in preferences for international cooperation., LINE: 298, BOOK: Migration Crises and the Struct, KEYWORD: exampl trade literatur import versu export econom sector potenti import actor level intern trade disput underli theoret framework argu migrat issu democraci differ systemat autocraci prefer intern
TEXT:  Our basic distinction is between sending and receiving states regardless of regime type. We develop our reasoning below. MARKET CONDITIONS AND STATE PREFERENCES When examining the interests of states in the international system relative to migration, we divide states into two categories: sending and receiving states., LINE: 299, BOOK: Migration Crises and the Struct, KEYWORD: basic distinct send state regardless regim type develop reason market condit state prefer examin interest state intern system rel migrat divid state two categori send state
TEXT: 4 Just as John Odell (2000) refers to “market conditions” as central to understanding state preferences on trade and how those preferences change, we refer to market conditions that separate states into those that attract immigrants and those that generate emigrants., LINE: 300, BOOK: Migration Crises and the Struct, KEYWORD: market condit central understand state prefer trade prefer chang refer market condit separ state attract immigr gener emigr
TEXT: 5 We have noted above the blurred line between voluntary and forced migration and observe that forced migrants are concentrated in the poorer countries of the Global South (UNHCR 2015). But voluntary migrants seek destinations that provide them with expanded opportunities, and hence we are able to distinguish destination countries as more stable and wealthier than voluntary emigrants’ home countries (UNDP 2009)., LINE: 301, BOOK: Migration Crises and the Struct, KEYWORD: note blur line voluntari forc migrat observ forc migrant concentr countri global south voluntari migrant seek destin provid expand opportun henc abl distinguish destin countri stabl voluntari emigr home countri
TEXT: 6 This is a simplification of the migration profile of states in the international system. All states send as well as receive migrants. Some are also geographically positioned to act as “transit” states between those sending and receiving., LINE: 302, BOOK: Migration Crises and the Struct, KEYWORD: simplif migrat profil state intern system state send well receiv migrant also geograph posit act transit state send
TEXT:  Yet all states have a net migration flow that weighs the number of emigrants against the number of immigrants and, we argue, serves to help understand the types of interests they pursue relative to migration issues., LINE: 303, BOOK: Migration Crises and the Struct, KEYWORD: yet state net migrat flow number emigr number immigr argu serf help understand type interest pursu rel migrat issu
TEXT:  Transit states may be receiving states, such as Spain, which serves as a conduit for migrants traveling to more northern states in Europe and also hosts a large migrant population of its own; transit states may be sending states, such as Morocco, which also serves as a conduit for migrants traveling to Europe, but remains a sending state with a net emigration balance., LINE: 304, BOOK: Migration Crises and the Struct, KEYWORD: transit state may state serf conduit migrant travel northern state also host larg migrant popul transit state may send state morocco also serf conduit migrant travel remain send state net emigr balanc
TEXT:  In Southern Africa, Mozambique is a transit as well as a sending state, as is Mexico in North America. As noted above, states may transition between sending and receiving status; when they do, we argue that their interests shift as well., LINE: 305, BOOK: Migration Crises and the Struct, KEYWORD: southern mozambiqu transit well send state north note state may transit send statu argu interest shift well
TEXT:  This simple dichotomy of sending and receiving state is employed in each chapter to outline state preferences on the five migration issues central to issues of international cooperation. However, in our quantitative analyses, we refine the dichotomy by employing a continuum based on net migration figures., LINE: 306, BOOK: Migration Crises and the Struct, KEYWORD: simpl dichotomi send state employ chapter outlin state prefer five migrat issu central issu intern howev quantit analysi refin dichotomi continuum base net migrat figur
TEXT:  The second attribute that we want to point out is the power characteristics of sending and receiving states.

TEXT:  THE BARGAINING FRAMEWORK The Status Quo Ante, State Preferences, and Power. Our bargaining framework begins with the status quo and the preferences of sending and receiving states. To illustrate, we can think of the status quo ante as the accepted behavior of states in customary international law related to admissions and departures of individuals at state borders., LINE: 309, BOOK: Migration Crises and the Struct, KEYWORD: framework statu quo ant state prefer power framework begin statu quo prefer send state illustr think statu quo ant accept behavior state customari intern law relat admiss departur individu state border
TEXT:  This can be depicted by a two-dimensional issue space, as shown in Figure 2.1. The most basic rule governing admissions is state sovereignty; the state has the right to turn away individuals seeking entry., LINE: 310, BOOK: Migration Crises and the Struct, KEYWORD: two dimension issu space shown figur basic rule govern admiss state sovereignti state ha right turn away individu seek entri
TEXT:  This rule has been abridged in several ways in customary international law. For example, states are required to allow their own citizens to enter, should they leave the territory of the state. A second abridgement of the rule is associated with the 1951 refugee convention that requires signatories to not refoule (turn away) refugees., LINE: 311, BOOK: Migration Crises and the Struct, KEYWORD: rule ha abridg sever way customari intern law exampl state allow citizen enter leav territori state second rule associ refuge convent signatori turn away refuge
TEXT:  This requires states to evaluate asylum claims of individuals seeking entry to determine whether they meet the refugee definition. In the two-dimensional issue space, the status quo on this dimension would reflect a point close but not equivalent to total state sovereignty., LINE: 312, BOOK: Migration Crises and the Struct, KEYWORD: state evalu asylum claim individu seek entri determin whether meet refuge definit two dimension issu space statu quo dimens would reflect point close equival total state sovereignti
TEXT:  Conversely, states are required by customary international law to permit their citizens to leave their country, save for concerns with public order. Thus, on the second issue dimension, the status quo would be reflected by low levels of state sovereignty., LINE: 313, BOOK: Migration Crises and the Struct, KEYWORD: convers state customari intern law permit citizen leav countri save concern public order thu second issu dimens statu quo would reflect low level state sovereignti
TEXT:  This represents one specific two-dimensional issue space. Each migration issue area has a two-dimensional (or multidimensional) issue space and a specific status quo ante. For each of the issue areas, we describe a specific status quo and specific preferences of sending and receiving states., LINE: 314, BOOK: Migration Crises and the Struct, KEYWORD: one specif two dimension issu space migrat issu area ha two dimension issu space specif statu quo ant issu area describ specif statu quo specif prefer send state
TEXT:  Generically, we point out that the win set of the status quo, the policies that both states would prefer to the status quo, is empty if one party prefers the status quo. As shown in Figure 2.2, State A prefers the status quo and State B prefers a position in the policy space that is different from the status quo., LINE: 315, BOOK: Migration Crises and the Struct, KEYWORD: gener point win set statu quo polici state would prefer statu quo empti one parti statu quo shown figur state statu quo state posit polici space differ statu quo
TEXT:  If State A is more powerful, State B has fewer resources to convince State A to change the status quo. If State B is more powerful, it can use its resources to provide side payments to State A to obtain State A’s consent to change the status quo., LINE: 316, BOOK: Migration Crises and the Struct, KEYWORD: state power state ha resourc convinc state chang statu quo state power use resourc provid side payment state obtain state consent chang statu quo

TEXT:  Receiving State A’s ideal point is identical to the status quo, whereas Sending State B prefers a different point in the policy space. Generically, the win set of the status quo is empty because there is no point in the policy space that both State A and State B prefer to the status quo., LINE: 319, BOOK: Migration Crises and the Struct, KEYWORD: state ideal point ident statu quo wherea send state differ point polici space gener win set statu quo empti point polici space state state prefer statu quo
TEXT:  Because Receiving State A is more powerful than Sending State B, it can resist efforts of the sending state to change the status quo. Hence, the status quo represents a privileged outcome; negotiations are unlikely to ensue., LINE: 320, BOOK: Migration Crises and the Struct, KEYWORD: state power send state resist effort send state chang statu quo henc statu quo privileg outcom negoti unlik ensu
TEXT:  Because we have defined receiving states as states with relatively more power and more stability, if State A is a receiving state and prefers the status quo, there is a strong likelihood that negotiations to change the status quo will not come to fruition, even though State B is dissatisfied with the status quo., LINE: 321, BOOK: Migration Crises and the Struct, KEYWORD: defin state state rel power stabil state state statu quo strong likelihood negoti chang statu quo come fruition even though state dissatisfi statu quo
TEXT:  This relationship holds, we argue, on both a bilateral basis and a multilateral basis.

TEXT:  Thus, we generate our second hypothesis. H2 When powerful states prefer the status quo ante, international cooperation is less likely to occur.

TEXT:  One of the resources they have garnered in the international system is the power of numbers achieved through institutional rules. An example is the United Nations where states of the Global South, individually less powerful than those of the Global North, can vote on provisions in the General Assembly and adopt by majority vote instruments that the Global North may not prefer., LINE: 324, BOOK: Migration Crises and the Struct, KEYWORD: one resourc intern system power number institut rule exampl unit nation state global south individu less power global north vote provis gener assembl adopt major vote instrument global north may prefer
TEXT:  However, this resource is limited in the sense that states are unbound by treaties that they choose not to ratify. So when the less powerful states can agree on a policy and locate a forum that provides them with institutional power, negotiations may proceed and even result in an international agreement., LINE: 325, BOOK: Migration Crises and the Struct, KEYWORD: howev resourc limit sens state unbound treati choos ratifi less power state agre polici locat forum institut power negoti may proceed even result intern agreement
TEXT:  However, the powerful states are not compelled to ratify the treaty. On issues of international migration, we argue that if sending states prefer a policy different from the status quo and can organize a coalition that allows them to employ institutional rules to initiate negotiations, then sending states may be able to obtain an international agreement that modifies the status quo., LINE: 326, BOOK: Migration Crises and the Struct, KEYWORD: howev power state ratifi treati issu intern migrat argu send state prefer polici differ statu quo organ coalit employ institut rule initi negoti send state may abl obtain intern agreement statu quo
TEXT:  However, sending states are unlikely to have the power resources to persuade receiving states to modify their opposition to the treaty proposals to change the status quo. An example of this type of event is the negotiation of the UN International Convention on the Protection of the Rights of All Migrant Workers and Members of Their Families between 1980 and 1990., LINE: 327, BOOK: Migration Crises and the Struct, KEYWORD: howev send state unlik power resourc persuad state modifi opposit treati propos chang statu quo exampl type event negoti intern convent protect right migrant worker member famili
TEXT: 7 Our third hypothesis captures this form of weak state power. H3a When less powerful states act as a coalition and find a forum that provides institutional power, bargaining is more likely to occur.

TEXT:  Exogenous Pressures and the Changing Costs of the Status Quo Ante.

TEXT:  Exogenous events come in many forms. Domestic political actors may create political costs for the government. In the realm of international migration, there are a number of anti-immigrant actors—political parties and interest groups—that may be able to embarrass the government and create electoral costs that the government finds unacceptable., LINE: 330, BOOK: Migration Crises and the Struct, KEYWORD: exogen event come mani form domest polit actor may creat polit cost govern realm intern migrat number anti immigr actor polit parti interest group may abl embarrass govern creat elector cost govern find unaccept

TEXT:  Migrants themselves are also actors. They can mobilize within a polity in a way that creates challenges to the government in power.

TEXT:  The concept of “best alternative to a negotiated agreement” is central to the bargaining literature and reflects the idea that parties to the negotiation will examine their alternatives and choose the one with the highest payoff., LINE: 339, BOOK: Migration Crises and the Struct, KEYWORD: concept best altern agreement central literatur idea parti negoti examin altern choos one highest payoff
TEXT:  If an alternative to a negotiated agreement provides a higher payoff, then the state will select it. If the negotiated agreement provides the highest payoff, then the agreement will be chosen.

TEXT:  Time is not on the receiving state’s side; its leaders need a resolution that reduces their costs.

TEXT:  They need an agreement. On the other side of the negotiating table, the sending or transit state may well be better satisfied with the status quo than is the receiving state. That is, although the sending or transit state prefers a policy position different from the status quo, that state’s position is closer to the status quo than to the position desired by the receiving state., LINE: 342, BOOK: Migration Crises and the Struct, KEYWORD: need agreement side tabl send transit state may well better satisfi statu quo state although send transit state polici posit differ statu quo state posit closer statu quo posit desir state

TEXT:  We adopt the position that customary international law is a good approximation of the behavior required of states in the international system. This is a useful and nonarbitrary method of understanding the status quo as customary international law is “the only vehicle for creating universal norms binding all States” and “is directly applicable by domestic courts in a substantial number of States” (Chetail 2014, 9)., LINE: 352, BOOK: Migration Crises and the Struct, KEYWORD: adopt posit customari intern law good approxim behavior state intern system use method understand statu quo customari intern law vehicl univers norm bind state directli applic domest court substanti number state

TEXT:  Take, for example, a thoroughfare in a town or city where the posted speed limit is forty-five miles per hour. Then add the construction of a new primary school that abuts this thoroughfare. Given the need to ensure the safety of the children who attend the new school, school leadership, or perhaps parents, may take unilateral action to build a wall between the thoroughfare and the school., LINE: 362, BOOK: Migration Crises and the Struct, KEYWORD: take exampl thoroughfar town citi post speed limit forti five mile per hour add construct new primari school thoroughfar given need ensur safeti child attend new school school leadership perhap parent may take unilater action build wall thoroughfar school

TEXT:  The parents and the school administrators may petition the local government to change the situation by reducing the speed to twenty-five miles per hour, or by putting in a stop sign or traffic light. Although this analogy is imperfect because this situation provides a specific decision process for changing traffic regulations, the issue of traffic regulations is analogous to international agreements on migration., LINE: 364, BOOK: Migration Crises and the Struct, KEYWORD: parent school administr may petit local govern chang situat reduc speed twenti five mile per hour stop sign traffic light although analog imperfect situat specif decis process traffic regul issu traffic regul analog intern agreement migrat
TEXT:  We are interested in when states enter international agreements to change the regulations governing state behavior on migration issues. One can trace the pressures that build that make the existing status quo—forty-five miles per hour—costly for the school, the parents, and the children, and that lead them to negotiate with the government over the existing traffic regulations., LINE: 365, BOOK: Migration Crises and the Struct, KEYWORD: interest state enter intern agreement chang regul govern state behavior migrat issu one trace pressur build make statu quo forti five mile per hour costli school parent child lead negoti govern traffic regul

TEXT:  INTERNATIONAL MIGRATION ISSUES To evaluate our hypotheses, we examine the issues generated by migration within the voluntary migration stream.

TEXT:  We then explore exogenous pressures that raise the costs of the status quo for receiving states or institutional forums that permit sending states to demand changes to the status quo.

TEXT:  In chapter 1, we argued that patterns of migration in the post–World War II period have been characterized primarily by state-specific, nonreciprocal flows. The theoretical work on the evolution of cooperation suggests that cooperation will be difficult in the absence of the possibility of reciprocity, and that where market failures or externalities are dyadic, the shape of cooperation is likely to be bilateral., LINE: 390, BOOK: Migration Crises and the Struct, KEYWORD: chapter pattern migrat post world war period primarili state specif nonreciproc flow theoret work evolut difficult absenc possibl reciproc market failur extern dyadic shape like bilater

TEXT:  Rarely, the costs of regime support are lower than the transaction costs of negotiating bilateral agreements.

TEXT:  Most commonly, the cooperation has taken the form of readmission agreements, which continue to provoke controversy among advocates for migrant and refugee rights.

TEXT:  If Rahim had been successful in his attempt to enter Europe, it is likely that his residence there would have been as an undocumented migrant or a rejected asylum seeker. He would not be unique.

TEXT:  A closer look, though, reveals that there are both internal and external dimensions of control: ensuring that only those individuals whom the state desires enter the territory of the state and detecting, apprehending, detaining, and deporting both those who evade the external controls and those who enter legally but overstay their entry provisions., LINE: 419, BOOK: Migration Crises and the Struct, KEYWORD: closer look though intern extern dimens control individu state desir enter territori state evad extern control enter legal overstay entri provis
TEXT:  The external dimension of control, or border management, falls squarely under the auspices of the travel regime, as proposed by Koslowski (2011a). Of course, the characteristics of the entrants can be quite varied: voluntary flows include short-term entrants such as tourists, family visitors, international students, and business visitors, as well as immigrants who intend to stay for at least twelve months; refugees and asylum seekers represent involuntary flows., LINE: 420, BOOK: Migration Crises and the Struct, KEYWORD: extern dimens control border manag fall squar auspex travel regim cours characterist entrant quit vari voluntari flow includ short term entrant tourist famili visitor intern student busi visitor well immigr intend stay least twelv month refuge asylum seeker repres involuntari flow

TEXT:  This includes the so-called rejected asylum seekers or false asylum seekers who have petitioned the host state for refugee status and have been rejected but have failed to leave the host state. This population represents the issue we address in this chapter: under what circumstances do states cooperate on the internal dimensions of immigration control and, in particular, on the reduction of undocumented migrant populations? In this chapter, we point to the rising costs associated with an undocumented resident population in the host state as the driver for the receiving state to initiate negotiations to enhance international cooperation on (internal) immigration control., LINE: 423, BOOK: Migration Crises and the Struct, KEYWORD: asylum seeker fals asylum seeker host state refuge statu leav host state popul issu address chapter circumst state intern dimens immigr control particular reduct undocu migrant popul chapter point rise cost associ undocu resid popul host state driver state initi negoti enhanc intern intern immigr control

TEXT:  Because of the unidirectional and unique flows of migrants, bilateralism is the dominant form of cooperation, as this reduces the costs of side payments receiving states must make to sending states. Even then, the win set of policies that both states would prefer to the status is usually empty, unless the ability of the receiving state to act unilaterally has also been curtailed in some way., LINE: 427, BOOK: Migration Crises and the Struct, KEYWORD: unidirect uniqu flow migrant bilater domin form cost side payment state must make send state even win set polici state would prefer statu usual empti unless abil state act unilater ha also curtail way

TEXT:  The general public may oppose immigration for fear of labor competition, concern about the fiscal burden migrants pose for the welfare state, or xenophobia (Hainmueller and Hiscox 2007).

TEXT:  Undocumented migrants are less likely to demand higher wages or to report illegal working conditions due to their fear of deportation.

TEXT:  Although we acknowledge the differences between unwanted and undocumented migration, we posit that receiving states prefer to retain sovereignty over the ability to deport undocumented aliens.

TEXT:  Second, the state may have the capabilities, but it may not deem it worthwhile to expend resources preventing or removing undocumented migrants.

TEXT:  Settler countries, such as the United States, Canada, and Australia, have struggled with the issue for well over a hundred years and pursued different unilateral polices over time (Freeman 1994).

TEXT:  Under customary international law, sending countries have long been expected to accept the return of their own citizens who are in another country illegally. This practice is a fundamental component of the basic concept of nationality, grounded in the individual’s right of return to his or her own country (Hailbronner 1997; Panizzon 2012; Chetail 2014)., LINE: 457, BOOK: Migration Crises and the Struct, KEYWORD: customari intern law send countri long accept return citizen anoth countri illeg practic fundament compon basic concept nation ground individu right return countri

TEXT:  However, in the post–World War II era, human rights treaties have abridged this right in important ways. Chetail (2014) lists four constraints on states’ ability to deport undocumented aliens. These include the prohibition against arbitrary detention, the prohibition of collective expulsion, the right of judicial review, and the right to human dignity., LINE: 459, BOOK: Migration Crises and the Struct, KEYWORD: howev post world war era human right treati abridg right import way list four constraint state abil deport undocu alien includ prohibit arbitrari detent prohibit collect expuls right judici review right human digniti

TEXT: 5 Nonetheless, states retain the unilateral right to detect, apprehend, detain, and deport undocumented aliens. Thus, the initial status quo in the post–World War II period favored receiving states, although the status quo had become much more costly with the individualization of deportation decisions required by the adoption of human rights conventions., LINE: 461, BOOK: Migration Crises and the Struct, KEYWORD: nonetheless state retain unilater right detect apprehend detain deport undocu alien thu initi statu quo post world war period favor state although statu quo becom much costli deport decis adopt human right convent

TEXT:  In the absence of identification papers, states may simply be unable to deport an undocumented alien. Once the efficacy of this strategy became apparent, migrants in compromised situations began to destroy their identity documents, and smugglers and traffickers, as well as migrant networks, carried the message to newly arriving migrants., LINE: 463, BOOK: Migration Crises and the Struct, KEYWORD: absenc identif paper state may simpli unabl deport undocu alien efficaci strategi appar migrant situat destroy ident document smuggler well migrant network carri messag newli migrant

TEXT:  It could, in many instances, claim that the individual was not a citizen. Moreover, states may also postpone or avoid repatriation of citizens by failing to provide the appropriate travel documents.

TEXT:  Thus, receiving states were also thwarted from returning undocumented aliens to the country they had transited. Receiving State Preferences. On the side of receiving states with an undocumented population, deportation is a mechanism for maintaining “the integrity of the immigration system” and reducing the costs of unwanted immigration (Ellermann 2008, 172)., LINE: 468, BOOK: Migration Crises and the Struct, KEYWORD: thu state also undocu alien countri state prefer side state undocu popul deport mechan integr immigr system reduc cost unwant immigr
TEXT:  In addition to the reasons enumerated by Ellermann, Adamson (2006, 176) adds the central issue of state security to the list. And Lloyd, Simmons, and Stewart (2012, 10) argue that an undocumented population represents a “challenge to the authority of the state itself., LINE: 469, BOOK: Migration Crises and the Struct, KEYWORD: addit reason add central issu state secur list argu undocu popul challeng author state
TEXT: ” Thus, the status quo of unilateral deportation initially served receiving state interests, but this changed once migrants and sending states adopted techniques that reduced the capacity to deport.

TEXT:  Sending State Preferences. For sending states, readmitting a citizen deported by the receiving state generates a significant cost.6 Castles (2004, 852) argues that “many less developed countries have identified labor export as important in reducing unemployment, improving the balance of payments, securing skills and investment capital, and stimulating development., LINE: 471, BOOK: Migration Crises and the Struct, KEYWORD: send state prefer send state citizen state signific cost castl mani less countri labor export import reduc unemploy improv balanc payment skill invest capit develop
TEXT:  In some cases, the export of discontent and reduction of political tension also become goals.” These all become costs if the emigrant returns. In particular, the loss of remittances, pressure on labor markets, and social challenges associated with reintegrating the returning population are enumerated as costs to the sending state (Ellermann 2008; Wong 2012)., LINE: 472, BOOK: Migration Crises and the Struct, KEYWORD: case export discont reduct polit tension also becom goal becom cost emigr return particular loss remitt pressur labor market social challeng associ popul cost send state wong
TEXT:  Additionally, we add that transit states also face audience costs associated with agreeing to accept not only the state’s own nationals, but also those of other sending states. Thus transit and sending states’ interests conflict with those of receiving states; while sending and transit states opposed the initial status quo of unilateral deportation, they were powerless to compel receiving states to change their behavior., LINE: 473, BOOK: Migration Crises and the Struct, KEYWORD: addit add transit state also face audienc cost associ agre accept state nation also send state thu transit send state interest conflict state send transit state oppos initi statu quo unilater deport powerless compel state chang behavior
TEXT:  Once deportation became difficult, sending and transit states had no interest in negotiating unless offered significant side payments. As Antje Ellermann (2008, 171) puts it, “At the root of non-cooperation is a fundamental conflict of interest between the deporting state, on the one hand, and the deportee and his or her country of nationality, on the other., LINE: 474, BOOK: Migration Crises and the Struct, KEYWORD: deport difficult send transit state interest unless signific side payment put root non fundament conflict interest state one hand deporte countri nation

TEXT:  To enlist the help of sending states in restricting and controlling migration, receiving states must offer something in return. Under what conditions will this occur? We argue that there are three sets of conditions that are important for cooperation., LINE: 476, BOOK: Migration Crises and the Struct, KEYWORD: enlist help send state migrat state must offer someth return condit occur argu three set condit import

TEXT:  Third, sending states must find the agreement sufficiently attractive to overcome their costs. Unless these conditions are met, unilateralism will prevail. Furthermore, formalized cooperation is likely to be bilateral rather than multilateral, because migration flows are unique and nonreciprocal; multilateral agreements raise the costs for receiving states to reach agreement., LINE: 478, BOOK: Migration Crises and the Struct, KEYWORD: third send state must find agreement suffici attract overcom cost unless condit met unilater prevail furthermor like bilater rather multilater migrat flow uniqu nonreciproc multilater agreement rais cost state reach agreement

TEXT:  While other flows, like trade, may affect domestic distribution of wealth, they rarely impose costs on the state (Ruhs and Chang 2004).

TEXT:  We argue that there are at least two types of costs associated with this bundle of rights: welfare costs and political costs. Welfare Costs. The cost of providing social welfare benefits to immigrants may affect the incentives for receiving states to pursue cooperation., LINE: 482, BOOK: Migration Crises and the Struct, KEYWORD: argu least two type cost associ bundl right welfar cost polit cost welfar cost cost provid social welfar benefit immigr may affect incent state pursu
TEXT:  There is some evidence that generous benefits may actually attract immigrants to particular countries (De Giorgi and Pellizzari 2006). Immigrants generally do not use social welfare benefits more than citizens, controlling for other socioeconomic factors, but immigrants tend to be systematically younger, poorer, and less educated than host state citizens, which means that they are more likely to be eligible for welfare benefits (Brücker et al., LINE: 483, BOOK: Migration Crises and the Struct, KEYWORD: evid gener benefit may actual attract immigr particular countri immigr gener use social welfar benefit citizen socioeconom factor immigr tend systemat younger less educ host state citizen mean like elig welfar benefit
TEXT:  2001). Two elements are important when calculating the welfare benefits costs of immigration. First, how great is the overall cost of the state’s welfare expenditures? States that devote more resources to social welfare benefits will face an even greater burden from increased immigration., LINE: 484, BOOK: Migration Crises and the Struct, KEYWORD: two element import calcul welfar benefit cost immigr first great overal cost state welfar expenditur state devot resourc social welfar benefit face even greater burden immigr

TEXT: 7 Excluding undocumented immigrants from government benefits depends on both a legal ability to exclude migrants and the practical ability to identify undocumented migrants. In Germany, for example, there are strict laws that prevent undocumented migrants from accessing health care and education., LINE: 486, BOOK: Migration Crises and the Struct, KEYWORD: exclud undocu immigr govern benefit legal abil exclud migrant practic abil identifi undocu migrant exampl strict law prevent undocu migrant health care educ
TEXT:  There are also sophisticated, linked computer databases that streamline enforcement, and regular workplace checks. In France, on the other hand, undocumented immigrants have a legal right to health care, and the courts have been reluctant to enforce laws that make being caught without proper identification and documentation a deportation-worthy crime., LINE: 487, BOOK: Migration Crises and the Struct, KEYWORD: also sophist link comput streamlin enforc regular workplac check hand undocu immigr legal right health care court reluct enforc law make caught without proper identif document deport worthi crime
TEXT:  Multiple agencies are responsible for investigating employers for illegally hiring undocumented workers, which makes enforcement cumbersome, and prosecution is rare (Doomernik and Jandl 2008). Thus, the social welfare costs due to undocumented immigrants incurred by France would likely be greater than those incurred by Germany., LINE: 488, BOOK: Migration Crises and the Struct, KEYWORD: multipl agenc respons investig employ illeg undocu worker make enforc cumbersom prosecut rare thu social welfar cost due undocu immigr would like greater

TEXT:  To citizens, states appear to be ineffective in protecting their borders, and public opinion polls suggest that citizens prefer fewer migrants.8 Although the salience of the issue varies among states, a certain portion of the population may organize to protest the presence of unwanted migrants, to the detriment of the government in power., LINE: 490, BOOK: Migration Crises and the Struct, KEYWORD: citizen state appear ineffect protect border public opinion poll suggest citizen prefer migrant although salienc issu among state certain portion popul may organ protest presenc unwant migrant detriment govern power

TEXT:  They argue that states respond to private lobbying by business interests to allow the inflow of at least some undocumented immigrants.

TEXT:  These competing forces lead to an equilibrium level of undocumented immigration that changes in response to economic conditions within the receiving country (Bond and Chen 1987; Djajić 1987). We suggest that states will thus be less likely to pursue new enforcement and control mechanisms, including cooperative arrangements, when the state is experiencing a period of economic expansion and full employment., LINE: 496, BOOK: Migration Crises and the Struct, KEYWORD: forc lead equilibrium level undocu immigr chang respons econom condit within countri bond suggest state thu less like pursu new enforc control mechan arrang state period econom expans full employ
TEXT:  In sum, the likelihood that receiving states will attempt to enter the negotiating arena to persuade sending states to accept their citizens and aliens who transited their territory depends on the level of costs associated with the undocumented population, costs that may be offset by the benefits that states may accrue from the undocumented immigrant population., LINE: 497, BOOK: Migration Crises and the Struct, KEYWORD: sum likelihood state attempt enter arena persuad send state accept citizen alien territori level cost associ undocu popul cost may offset benefit state may accru undocu immigr popul
TEXT:  Diminished Unilateral Control. The second condition that propels states to the negotiating table is a loss of unilateral control. The post–World War II period has been characterized by both increased global mobility and the widespread adoption of international, regional, and bilateral agreements., LINE: 498, BOOK: Migration Crises and the Struct, KEYWORD: unilater control second condit state tabl loss unilater control post world war period ha global mobil widespread adopt intern region bilater agreement
TEXT:  These agreements address various human rights, labor mobility, and border control and represent a voluntary relinquishment of sovereignty that can affect a state’s ability to sort and control migration flows through unilateral expulsion of anyone they do not want (Sassen 1996; also see Betts 2006 and UNDP 2009, 21)., LINE: 499, BOOK: Migration Crises and the Struct, KEYWORD: agreement address variou human right labor mobil border control repres voluntari relinquish sovereignti affect state abil sort control migrat flow unilater expuls anyon want also see

TEXT:  The most prominent example is Europe, where states have adopted freedom of movement via EU institutions and a passport-free zone via the Schengen Agreement. Because they have voluntarily relinquished significant levels of sovereignty over border control, they have been incentivized to construct much more formal and extensive cooperative arrangements with sending states than seen anywhere else in the world., LINE: 502, BOOK: Migration Crises and the Struct, KEYWORD: promin exampl state adopt freedom movement via institut passport free zone via agreement voluntarili signific level sovereignti border control construct much formal extens arrang send state seen anywher els world

TEXT:  Schengen, however, abolished all internal border control mechanisms, which allowed for the free movement of everyone, not just Europeans.

TEXT:  Thus, the Schengen Agreement relinquishes control over entry to the least well-policed borders, and to those countries with geographic proximity to poorer states.

TEXT:  Both freedom of movement and common travel zones make claims on states’ ability to unilaterally determine which migrants may enter and reside. This phenomenon is not unique to these agreements or to this issue area; over the past several decades, world politics has become increasingly “legalized,” with states voluntarily making binding commitments across a wide range of issues to reap a wide range of benefits., LINE: 522, BOOK: Migration Crises and the Struct, KEYWORD: freedom movement common travel zone make claim state abil unilater determin migrant may enter resid phenomenon uniqu agreement issu area past sever decad world polit ha becom increasingli state voluntarili make bind commit across wide rang issu reap wide rang benefit
TEXT: 12 But these benefits come at a price. The loss of sovereignty generates an effort to reclaim control through other means, and one way states can do this is through, ironically, further legalization. In the case of migration, bilateral readmission agreements are one legal tool through which states can reclaim sovereignty., LINE: 523, BOOK: Migration Crises and the Struct, KEYWORD: benefit come price loss sovereignti effort reclaim control mean one way state iron legal case migrat bilater readmiss agreement one legal tool state reclaim sovereignti
TEXT:  In other words, receiving states’ costs associated with the status quo rose, impelling them to the negotiating table.13 Costs to the Sending State. Wong (2012) and Ellermann (2008) have suggested that sending states are unlikely to sign or implement readmission agreements because of the domestic costs they face when repatriating deported citizens., LINE: 524, BOOK: Migration Crises and the Struct, KEYWORD: word state cost associ statu quo rose tabl cost send state wong send state unlik sign implement readmiss agreement domest cost face citizen

TEXT:  The sending state, however, has little desire to accept the return of its own citizens, and even less desire to accept the return of foreigners who simply transited through the state’s territory. Receiving states must thus provide other incentives to the sending state in order to ensure cooperation in controlling migration (Wong 2012)., LINE: 527, BOOK: Migration Crises and the Struct, KEYWORD: send state howev ha littl desir accept return citizen even less desir accept return foreign simpli state territori state must thu provid incent send state order ensur migrat wong

TEXT:  Sending states may actually seek out agreements with receiving states as a relatively low-cost way to obtain these benefits.

TEXT:  Having outlined the conditions under which we anticipate cooperation to arise, we now turn to the empirical evidence at the bilateral, regional, and multilateral levels. BILATERAL READMISSION AGREEMENTS: FORMAL COOPERATION AMONG STATES Readmission agreements both codify the expectation that countries will readmit their own citizens, setting out protocols for identifying citizens and providing associated travel documents, and expand it, usually requiring that signatory countries also admit stateless persons and citizens of third countries who entered the receiving country through the transit country., LINE: 538, BOOK: Migration Crises and the Struct, KEYWORD: outlin condit anticip aris turn empir evid bilater region multilater level bilater readmiss agreement formal among state readmiss agreement codifi expect countri readmit citizen set protocol citizen provid associ travel document expand usual signatori countri also admit stateless person citizen third countri countri transit countri

TEXT:  This is not because the problem of undocumented migration has dissipated; almost one in five migrants is undocumented.

TEXT:  This variation can be explained in part by the variation in costs experienced by the receiving states, offset by variation in the demand for immigrants. Although most states have signed international agreements that limit their ability to control the entry and residence of foreigners,19 European states are the most constrained by treaties involving European integration and, hence, are the locus of most bilateral readmission agreements., LINE: 553, BOOK: Migration Crises and the Struct, KEYWORD: variat part variat cost experienc state offset variat demand immigr although state intern agreement limit abil control entri resid foreign state constrain treati integr henc locu bilater readmiss agreement

TEXT:  Because receiving states seek to initiate bilateral readmission agreements, they would not be averse to using their leverage to threaten or coerce a sending state to ensure agreement.

TEXT:  The data on migrant flows end between 2000 and 2004. This means that the data are both left- and right-censored. They are left-censored because countries were at risk of signing an agreement before 1980 and right-censored because countries may have signed agreements after 2004; in fact, they may continue to sign agreements into the future., LINE: 573, BOOK: Migration Crises and the Struct, KEYWORD: data migrant flow end mean data left right left countri risk agreement right countri may agreement fact may continu sign agreement futur

TEXT:  This is a low bar to clear, but the record of readmission agreements shows that some destination countries do sign readmission agreements with states that send only a small number of migrants.

TEXT:  Growing support for right-wing parties indicates that the public thinks there are too many immigrants.

TEXT:  When unemployment decreases, we expect that the demand for readmission agreements will decrease. We argue that states will be more likely to conclude a readmission agreement the larger the inflow of undocumented migrants., LINE: 592, BOOK: Migration Crises and the Struct, KEYWORD: unemploy decreas expect demand readmiss agreement decreas argu state like conclud readmiss agreement inflow undocu migrant
TEXT:  However, there are no accurate data on annual inflows of undocumented migrants from particular source countries; any data that do exist are very broad and can provide only a rough estimate. We thus use the flow of documented migrants as a proxy for undocumented migrants., LINE: 593, BOOK: Migration Crises and the Struct, KEYWORD: howev accur data annual inflow undocu migrant particular sourc countri data exist broad provid rough estim thu use flow migrant proxi undocu migrant
TEXT:  There are several reasons to expect that undocumented migrant flows would be highly correlated with documented migrant flows. First and foremost, migrant networks are mechanisms for continuing migration by providing information and resources for new migrants (Massey and Liang 1989)., LINE: 594, BOOK: Migration Crises and the Struct, KEYWORD: sever reason expect undocu migrant flow would highli correl migrant flow first foremost migrant network mechan migrat provid inform resourc new migrant liang
TEXT:  These migrants can be both documented and undocumented. Moreover, an original documented migrant can become an attractor to undocumented flows through unauthorized family reunification; these family migrants can usually enter the country legally for a visit, but become undocumented through overstaying., LINE: 595, BOOK: Migration Crises and the Struct, KEYWORD: migrant undocu moreov origin migrant becom attractor undocu flow unauthor famili reunif famili migrant usual enter countri legal visit becom undocu
TEXT:  Second, the migrant’s status depends on the host country’s regulations. Documented migrants often end up as undocumented migrants, as their visas expire and they fail to leave the country. A good example of this pattern is the rise in undocumented Mexicans in the United States after the passage of the 1965 Immigration Act., LINE: 596, BOOK: Migration Crises and the Struct, KEYWORD: second migrant statu host countri regul migrant often end undocu migrant visa expir fail leav countri good exampl pattern rise undocu unit state passag immigr act
TEXT:  Legal circular flows became permanent undocumented flows in light of the restrictions imposed on Western Hemispheric migration as a result of the act (Massey and Liang 1989; Money and Victor 2015). In the absence of data on undocumented flows, we assume that larger documented flows likely correspond with larger undocumented flows., LINE: 597, BOOK: Migration Crises and the Struct, KEYWORD: legal circular flow perman undocu flow light restrict western migrat result act liang money victor absenc data undocu flow assum flow like correspond undocu flow
TEXT:  The data come from the UN’s “International Migration Flows to and from Selected Countries: The 2005 Revision” (United Nations, Department of Economics and Social Affairs, Population Division 2005).23 We expect that receiving states may attempt to coerce sending states into concluding readmission agreements., LINE: 598, BOOK: Migration Crises and the Struct, KEYWORD: data come intern migrat flow select countri revis unit nation depart econom social affair popul divis expect state may attempt coerc send state conclud readmiss agreement
TEXT:  We measure a receiving state’s coercive power as the GDP differential, subtracting the sending state’s GDP per capita from the receiving state’s GDP per capita, both adjusted for purchasing power parity (World Bank 2011)., LINE: 599, BOOK: Migration Crises and the Struct, KEYWORD: measur state coerciv power differenti send state per state per power pariti world bank
TEXT:  Control Variables. The variation in the number of readmission agreements signed by European states may in part be due to bureaucratic inertia. Once one agreement has been signed, it becomes easier to sign another., LINE: 600, BOOK: Migration Crises and the Struct, KEYWORD: control variabl variat number readmiss agreement state may part due bureaucrat inertia one agreement ha becom easier sign anoth
TEXT:  The state then has a model for future agreements, and it also has negotiating experience, which reduces the cost of each future agreement. The process of concluding agreements may generate individual bureaucrats and even departments with an interest in pursuing more agreements as a way to expand their sphere of policy control., LINE: 601, BOOK: Migration Crises and the Struct, KEYWORD: state ha model futur agreement also ha experi cost futur agreement process conclud agreement may gener individu bureaucrat even depart interest agreement way expand sphere polici control
TEXT:  This effect may be especially strong when the incentives needed to induce the sending country to sign an agreement are low. France, for example, has signed an extraordinary number of readmission agreements, and it has even pursued agreements with far-flung countries (for example, in Latin America) that export a relatively small number of migrants to France., LINE: 602, BOOK: Migration Crises and the Struct, KEYWORD: effect may especi strong incent induc send countri sign agreement low exampl ha extraordinari number readmiss agreement ha even agreement far flung countri exampl export rel small number migrant
TEXT:  The effect of bureaucratic inertia is probably small, and it certainly would not override broader state interests (if there are any related to readmission in a particular case). However, it does seem reasonable that the more agreements that a state has signed, the more agreements it is likely to sign in the future., LINE: 603, BOOK: Migration Crises and the Struct, KEYWORD: effect bureaucrat inertia probabl small certainli would overrid state interest relat readmiss particular case howev doe seem reason agreement state ha agreement like sign futur
TEXT:  Bureaucratic inertia is measured simply by adding up the total number of readmission agreements signed by the receiving country up until a given year. Last, we control for geographic distance between the sending and receiving countries (Cassarino 2010)., LINE: 604, BOOK: Migration Crises and the Struct, KEYWORD: bureaucrat inertia measur simpli total number readmiss agreement countri given year last control geograph distanc send countri
TEXT:  We expect that states that are geographically farther apart are less likely to sign agreements with each other. The effect of distance may be overwhelmed by the effect of migrant flows, but distance may have a distinct effect, particularly since migration from geographically proximate states may be harder to control than migration from distant states., LINE: 605, BOOK: Migration Crises and the Struct, KEYWORD: expect state geograph farther apart less like sign agreement effect distanc may effect migrant flow distanc may distinct effect particularli sinc migrat geograph proxim state may harder control migrat distant state
TEXT:  Persistent migrants from nearby states will likely have an easier time overcoming barriers that receiving states erect to control migration. Moreover, geographically proximate states can become transit states for migrants from more distant locations., LINE: 606, BOOK: Migration Crises and the Struct, KEYWORD: persist migrant nearbi state like easier time barrier state erect control migrat moreov geograph proxim state becom transit state migrant distant locat
TEXT:  Thus, receiving states may find that other tools, apart from readmission agreements, are sufficiently effective for controlling migration from distant states but insufficient for controlling migration from those nearby., LINE: 607, BOOK: Migration Crises and the Struct, KEYWORD: thu state may find tool apart readmiss agreement suffici effect migrat distant state insuffici migrat nearbi
TEXT:  Quantitative Test: Results. The results of the analysis are displayed in Table 3.3. First, signing the Schengen Agreement has a strong and significant effect, as expected. Surrendering sovereignty over border control by creating a common border with Schengen member states is followed by an increase in readmission agreements., LINE: 608, BOOK: Migration Crises and the Struct, KEYWORD: quantit test result result analysi display tabl first agreement ha strong signific effect sovereignti border control common border member state increas readmiss agreement
TEXT:  In an alternate model specification, Schengen implementation was measured rather than the signing of the agreement. In this specification, agreement implementation did not have a significant effect, and the model actually suggested that the effect is negative., LINE: 609, BOOK: Migration Crises and the Struct, KEYWORD: altern model specif implement wa measur rather agreement specif agreement implement signific effect model actual effect neg
TEXT:  This makes sense; the period of time between signing the Schengen Agreement and the date it went into effect is very long. The original signatories of Schengen in 1985 gave themselves an entire decade to prepare for the transition, which included standardizing admission requirements, streamlining procedures, and, it appears, preparing for negative externalities by pursuing bilateral readmission agreements with states outside the Schengen Area., LINE: 610, BOOK: Migration Crises and the Struct, KEYWORD: make sens period time agreement date went effect long origin signatori gave entir decad prepar transit includ admiss requir procedur neg extern bilater readmiss agreement state outsid area
TEXT:  By the time the agreement actually went into effect, the receiving countries had already signed the majority of the agreements that they intended to sign. States thus likely anticipated the changes that the Schengen Agreement was going to bring and planned accordingly., LINE: 611, BOOK: Migration Crises and the Struct, KEYWORD: time agreement actual went effect countri alreadi major agreement intend sign state thu like chang agreement wa go bring accordingli
TEXT:  The domestic welfare cost of migrants does not have the expected effect, but these are not significant results.24 These results can be interpreted in two ways. First, it could be that economic costs in the form of welfare benefits for immigrants do not, in fact, move migration policy., LINE: 612, BOOK: Migration Crises and the Struct, KEYWORD: domest welfar cost migrant doe effect signific result result two way first could econom cost form welfar benefit immigr fact move migrat polici
TEXT:  If so, this is a surprising result; migration policy scholars and observers have argued that higher welfare costs of immigration are a key determinant of negative public opinion toward migrants (Hanson, Scheve, and Slaughter 2007; Hainmueller and Hiscox 2007; Mayda 2006)., LINE: 613, BOOK: Migration Crises and the Struct, KEYWORD: surpris result migrat polici scholar observ higher welfar cost immigr key determin neg public opinion toward migrant slaughter
TEXT:  If our result is accurate, then this casts doubt on existing theories of migration policy. But there is a second explanation: it could be that our measure does not accurately capture the welfare costs of immigrants., LINE: 614, BOOK: Migration Crises and the Struct, KEYWORD: result accur cast doubt theori migrat polici second explan could measur doe accur captur welfar cost immigr
TEXT:  This may be because countries restrict access to social welfare benefits so that migrants cannot enjoy them. Thus, rising immigration rates alone may not increase social welfare costs. To determine which explanation is correct, further research on immigrant access to government welfare across countries and across time is needed., LINE: 615, BOOK: Migration Crises and the Struct, KEYWORD: may countri restrict access social welfar benefit migrant cannot enjoy thu rise immigr rate alon may increas social welfar cost determin explan correct research immigr access govern welfar across countri across time
TEXT:  However, the fact that there are no readily available data on immigrant access to government welfare is, itself, a challenge to the theory that welfare costs drive restrictive migration policy. If we, as researchers, cannot assess the true welfare costs of immigrants, how can policymakers (or the public)? If costs are opaque, then they are unlikely to drive policy., LINE: 616, BOOK: Migration Crises and the Struct, KEYWORD: howev fact readili avail data immigr access govern welfar challeng theori welfar cost drive restrict migrat polici research cannot assess true welfar cost immigr public cost opaqu unlik drive polici

TEXT:  As electoral support for right-wing parties grows, a country becomes more likely to pursue restrictive migration policy through readmission agreements. This result may perhaps support one of the proposed explanations for the insignificance of welfare expenditures: it is not welfare expenditures per se that influence readmission policy but the politically salient perception of high costs that mobilize anti-immigrant sentiment and fuel right-wing parties., LINE: 622, BOOK: Migration Crises and the Struct, KEYWORD: elector support right wing parti countri becom like pursu restrict migrat polici readmiss agreement result may perhap support one explan insignific welfar expenditur welfar expenditur per influenc readmiss polici polit salient percept high cost mobil anti immigr sentiment fuel right wing parti
TEXT:  Pursuing readmission agreements may be a way to politically signal that policymakers are “tough on immigration.” Although we do not attempt to actually assess the effectiveness of readmission agreements in reducing unwanted migration and the accompanying fiscal costs, such effectiveness might not even be relevant if political costs are paramount., LINE: 623, BOOK: Migration Crises and the Struct, KEYWORD: readmiss agreement may way polit signal tough immigr although attempt actual assess effect readmiss agreement reduc unwant migrat fiscal cost effect might even relev polit cost paramount

TEXT:  Countries experiencing low unemployment are more likely to demand more immigrants and thus are less likely to seek out readmission agreements to control immigration, and vice versa.

TEXT:  States do not pursue agreements with all others but focus on those with which they have a significant migrant flow. This explains both why receiving states pursue different numbers of agreements and why they pursue them with different sending states., LINE: 627, BOOK: Migration Crises and the Struct, KEYWORD: state pursu agreement focu signific migrant flow state pursu differ number agreement pursu differ send state
TEXT:  In addition, this may explain why bilateral readmission agreements remain more popular than multilateral agreements. Since receiving states do not share the same migration profiles, they do not seek to conclude readmission agreements with the same sending states., LINE: 628, BOOK: Migration Crises and the Struct, KEYWORD: addit may explain bilater readmiss agreement remain popular multilater agreement sinc state share migrat profil seek conclud readmiss agreement send state

TEXT:  The more agreements a country has signed, the more agreements it is expected to sign in the future.

TEXT:  In addition, familiarity and experience with readmission agreements may reduce the cost of drafting and concluding new ones, which would reduce the incentives needed to induce a receiving state to pursue a readmission agreement., LINE: 633, BOOK: Migration Crises and the Struct, KEYWORD: addit familiar experi readmiss agreement may reduc cost draft conclud new one would reduc incent induc state pursu readmiss agreement
TEXT:  Last, geographic distance between sending and receiving states has a significant effect in the expected direction. States that are geographically farther away from each other are less likely to conclude agreements with each other., LINE: 634, BOOK: Migration Crises and the Struct, KEYWORD: last geograph distanc send state ha signific effect direct state geograph farther away less like conclud agreement
TEXT:  This relationship remains significant even though migrant flows are included in the model, which suggests that distance is not important simply because geographically proximate sending states send a larger number of migrants to receiving states than do more distant sending states., LINE: 635, BOOK: Migration Crises and the Struct, KEYWORD: relationship remain signific even though migrant flow includ model distanc import simpli geograph proxim send state send number migrant state distant send state
TEXT:  This could signify that receiving states are better able to control the flow of migrants from more far-flung states using tools other than readmission agreements. These other, more unilateral tools may be less effective on closer neighbors, creating an incentive to turn to readmission agreements., LINE: 636, BOOK: Migration Crises and the Struct, KEYWORD: could signifi state better abl control flow migrant far flung state tool readmiss agreement unilater tool may less effect closer neighbor incent turn readmiss agreement
TEXT:  In addition, it may be cost-effective to offshore border control in geographically proximate states but not in more distant states.

TEXT:  In their simplest form, hazard ratios indicate that a unit increase in the independent variable signifies an increase in the probability that the event of interest (the signing of a readmission agreement) will occur in the next period (the next year) (Duerden 2009)., LINE: 638, BOOK: Migration Crises and the Struct, KEYWORD: form hazard ratio indic unit increas independ variabl increas probabl event interest readmiss agreement occur next period next year

TEXT:  The interpretation of the coefficients is complicated by that fact that diagnostic tests revealed nonproportional hazards in the original model.

TEXT:  The constituent coefficients now must be interpreted as the effect only during the first year of the analysis (1980), and not the effect of the variables over the entire period.

TEXT:  As noted earlier, the bilateral readmission agreements are concentrated in two periods, the early 1960s subsequent to the signing of the Treaty of Rome, which established free movement of labor among the original EEC member states, and the period after 1985 that saw the signing of the Schengen Agreement among the original participants (Germany, France, and the Benelux countries) and the Treaty of Maastricht (1992), which extended the right of movement to all citizens of member states., LINE: 648, BOOK: Migration Crises and the Struct, KEYWORD: note bilater readmiss agreement concentr two period earli subsequ treati establish free movement labor among origin member state period saw agreement among origin particip countri treati extend right movement citizen member state

TEXT:  FIGURE 3.3Timing of Bilateral Readmission Agreements (Selected European States) Figure includes the nine most active receiving country signers of readmission agreements.Source: Cassarino (2014).

TEXT:  And most of these states are members of the European Union. It is important to ask whether the bilateral readmission agreements were supplemented at the regional level. As noted earlier, the European Union proposed a model readmission agreement for states to employ in 1994, which, in the language of Thompson and Verdier (2014), reduced the “transaction costs” of bilateral agreements by providing boilerplate language for future agreements., LINE: 659, BOOK: Migration Crises and the Struct, KEYWORD: state member union import ask whether bilater readmiss agreement region level note union model readmiss agreement state employ languag reduc transact cost bilater agreement provid languag futur agreement

TEXT:  As our theory anticipates, region-wide agreements negotiated by the executive body of the EU, the European Commission, have been few.

The Council of the European Union—the body representing member states—requested that the commission include readmission clauses in all future cooperation agreements with third countries in 2002 (Roig and Huddleston 2007)., LINE: 667, BOOK: Migration Crises and the Struct, KEYWORD: commiss pursu readmiss facilit deport bilater still council union bodi member state commiss includ readmiss claus futur agreement third countri
TEXT:  The commission has taken up the task and, as of 2007, has negotiated 102 readmission clauses in third country agreements. The ability of the European Commission to insert such clauses in new cooperation agreements is a function of coercion: sending countries no longer have leverage to extract a specific quid pro quo because the agreements are embedded in broad aid and trade pacts., LINE: 668, BOOK: Migration Crises and the Struct, KEYWORD: commiss ha taken task ha readmiss claus third countri agreement abil commiss insert claus new agreement function coercion send countri longer leverag extract specif quid pro quo agreement broad aid trade pact
TEXT:  One specific example is the Cotonou Agreement with ninety-seven African, Caribbean, and Pacific countries, which entered into force in 2003.

TEXT:  The issue of the readmission of third country nationals is minimized by requiring additional negotiations between the parties to the agreement. More important in terms of results, however, is the fact that readmission clauses are not self-executing and require additional bilateral negotiations to enter into force (Roig and Huddleston 2007)., LINE: 670, BOOK: Migration Crises and the Struct, KEYWORD: issu readmiss third countri nation addit negoti parti agreement import term result howev fact readmiss claus self requir addit bilater negoti enter forc
TEXT:  Per Roig and Huddleston (2007, 371), “The status of Article 13 [the readmission clause in the Cotonou Agreement] remains unclear and disputed between both parties.” So even in the region that produces the vast majority of readmission agreements, cooperation at the regional level is nominal., LINE: 671, BOOK: Migration Crises and the Struct, KEYWORD: per statu articl readmiss claus agreement remain unclear parti even region produc vast major readmiss agreement region level nomin

TEXT:  As noted in chapter 4, states maintain border controls, and policies toward third country nationals remain solely under state control (IOM 2007).

TEXT:  The various protocols of the common market were implemented over a period of several years between 1990 and 2002, with free movement slowly being implemented starting in 1995.

TEXT:  This provision was then extended to athletes and artists. These classes of migrants, however, are quite small, and the facilitation of movement has yet to be extended to all workers.

TEXT:  The Mercosur common market agreement goes even further than CARICOM in establishing free movement, but the actual effect of the agreement on member states is far more limited.

TEXT:  Unlike the European Union, Mercosur is primarily intergovernmental, not institutional, and has no independent judicial body (Mecham 2003).

TEXT:  In addition, Mercosur’s leadership has primarily focused on other aspects of the common market, like trade in goods, rather than migration and labor mobility. Mercosur’s executive body, the Common Market Group, has ten working subgroups but only one is focused on migration and it has largely concentrated on border controls, not free movement (Maguid 2007)., LINE: 685, BOOK: Migration Crises and the Struct, KEYWORD: addit leadership ha primarili aspect common market like trade good rather migrat labor mobil execut bodi common market group ha ten work subgroup one migrat ha larg concentr border control free movement

TEXT: 29 This literature has generally not examined the reasons why some states pursue readmission agreements and others do not, let alone why states rarely cooperate on migration control more broadly.

The answer is a resounding yes; in tracing the construction of readmission agreements between the EU and Turkey, we can also assess the side payments that Turkey was able to extract from the EU., LINE: 741, BOOK: Migration Crises and the Struct, KEYWORD: migrant crisi case studi quantit analysi recent migrant crisi follow pattern theoret framework answer resound ye trace construct readmiss agreement turkey also assess side payment turkey wa abl extract

TEXT:  The political price has also been high, with the rise of new, and the growing success of already established, anti-immigrant right-wing parties in Europe.

TEXT:  In 2009 a new draft text was prepared and forwarded to the Turkish negotiators. This new agreement was signed on 13 December 2013 and entered into force on 1 October 2014.

TEXT:  Nonetheless, the flows continued and a new agreement with new incentives was needed to stem the tide. That agreement came in the form of the EU–Turkey Statement on 19 March 2016.

TEXT: 34 More importantly, the EU agreed to accelerate the visa liberalization road map and to lift the visa requirements for Turkish citizens at the latest by the end of June 2016 (Kirişci 2014).

TEXT:  Visa-free travel for Turkish citizens is indeed a significant price to pay. Turkey is a country with more than seventy million citizens—larger than any EU country save Germany. The road map, however, does require Turkey “to implement in a full and effective manner the readmission agreement, to manage the borders and the visa policy in such a manner as to effectively prevent irregular migration, to have secure travel documents, to establish migrant and asylum systems in line with international standards, to have functioning structures for combating organized crime with focus on migrants’ smuggling and trafficking in human beings, to have in place and implement adequate forms of police and judicial cooperation with the EU Member States and the international community, and to respect the fundamental rights of the citizens and foreigners with a specific attention to persons belonging to minorities and vulnerable categories” (European Commission 2014, 1)., LINE: 760, BOOK: Migration Crises and the Struct, KEYWORD: visa free travel citizen inde signific price pay turkey countri seventi million citizen countri save road map howev doe requir turkey implement full effect manner readmiss agreement manag border visa polici manner effect prevent irregular migrat secur travel document establish migrant asylum system line intern standard structur organ crime focu migrant smuggl human place implement adequ form polic judici member state intern commun respect fundament right citizen foreign specif attent person belong minor vulner categori commiss

TEXT:  Then a readmission agreement was negotiated, but the side payments were insufficient to actually achieve the readmission of third country nationals.

TEXT:  Europe stepped up its pressure on Turkey to arrest the flows, promising 3 to 4 billion euros to support Syrians in Turkey in the October 2015 Joint Action Plan. That payment was insufficient to elicit the needed cooperation, and the EU upped the ante to an additional 3 billion euros and a promise of visa-free travel in the EU–Turkey Statement., LINE: 765, BOOK: Migration Crises and the Struct, KEYWORD: step pressur turkey arrest flow promis billion support turkey joint action plan payment wa insuffici elicit ant addit billion promis visa free travel turkey statement
TEXT:  CONCLUSIONS Detecting, apprehending, detaining, and deporting undocumented migrants is one method states employ to control immigration; to be effective, receiving states require the cooperation of sending states to accept their own citizens as well as transit migrants., LINE: 766, BOOK: Migration Crises and the Struct, KEYWORD: conclus undocu migrant one method state employ control immigr effect state requir send state accept citizen well transit migrant
TEXT:  Yet unilateral action, as opposed to international cooperation, remains the preferred method of interior immigration control.

TEXT:  In part, this is due to the determination and ingenuity of migrants themselves; as states erect new barriers to restrict migration, determined migrants find ways to circumvent them. There are other reasons, however, why states fail to eliminate irregular migration through interior immigration control., LINE: 768, BOOK: Migration Crises and the Struct, KEYWORD: part due determin ingenu migrant state erect new barrier restrict migrat determin migrant find way circumv reason howev state fail elimin irregular migrat interior immigr control
TEXT:  First, states may prefer alternative methods to achieve their policy goals; second, states may be ambivalent about the level of irregular migration itself. As noted in our introduction, efforts to combat irregular immigration can be divided into two types: those that focus on preventing unauthorized entry and those that focus on interior enforcement., LINE: 769, BOOK: Migration Crises and the Struct, KEYWORD: first state may prefer altern method achiev polici goal second state may ambival level irregular migrat note introduct effort combat irregular immigr divid two type focu unauthor entri focu interior enforc

TEXT:  Most continental European states have placed greater emphasis on interior enforcement (Martin 2004). The most obvious factor in explaining these differences is geographic location, followed by international constraints., LINE: 771, BOOK: Migration Crises and the Struct, KEYWORD: continent state greater emphasi interior enforc martin obviou factor explain differ geograph locat intern constraint
TEXT:  Island states clearly have an advantage in controlling their borders, and European Schengen states are constrained by open borders among member states.

TEXT:  The United States shares a border with Mexico that is nearly two thousand miles long, yet it has focused most of its attention on border control rather than interior enforcement. This suggests that states may be ambivalent about interior enforcement methods, which require a culture of monitoring that is more acceptable in some states than in others., LINE: 773, BOOK: Migration Crises and the Struct, KEYWORD: unit state share border nearli two thousand mile long yet ha attent border control rather interior enforc state may ambival interior enforc method requir cultur accept state
TEXT:  Most Central European states, for example, require everyone to carry national identification cards, and police are permitted to randomly stop individuals and request the card. On the opposite end of the spectrum, the United States maintains no national identification system and places limits on the ability of police to stop individuals without cause., LINE: 774, BOOK: Migration Crises and the Struct, KEYWORD: central state exampl requir everyon carri nation identif card polic permit randomli stop individu request card opposit end spectrum unit state nation identif system place limit abil polic stop individu without caus

TEXT:  Although most of the state law was eventually allowed to stand, it was challenged in court by the federal government (Santos 2014). Unlike interior enforcement, border enforcement provokes less controversy, in part because citizens are not regularly confronted with it, and it does not infringe on the rights of citizens safely within the state., LINE: 776, BOOK: Migration Crises and the Struct, KEYWORD: although state law wa eventu stand wa court feder govern unlik interior enforc border enforc less controversi part citizen regularli doe infring right citizen safe within state
TEXT:  Workplace checks, which can be an effective interior enforcement method of identifying undocumented immigrants, may also provoke dissatisfaction.

TEXT:  In the last year of the Bush administration, there were 503 audits; in 2009, the government conducted more than 8,000 (Sherman 2013). In 2008, federal authorities issued only 18 “final orders” against employers for hiring undocumented workers, collecting $675,209; in 2012, that number increased to 495, collecting $12., LINE: 779, BOOK: Migration Crises and the Struct, KEYWORD: last year bush administr audit govern feder author final order employ undocu worker number

TEXT:  As California senator Dianne Feinstein wrote in September 2013, “The reality is that the majority of farmworkers in the US are foreign-born and unauthorized, which is well-known.” She added that she was “afraid that this aggressive worksite enforcement strategy will deprive the agricultural sector of most of its workforce” (Doyle 2013)., LINE: 781, BOOK: Migration Crises and the Struct, KEYWORD: senat wrote realiti major foreign born unauthor well known ad wa afraid aggress enforc strategi depriv agricultur sector
TEXT:  Other countries face similar opposition to workplace enforcement, even when there is an established monitoring culture. During the 1990s, the German government stepped up workplace checks in the construction industry, which employed 550,000, including 200,000 foreigners, despite a 10 percent unemployment rate among German construction workers., LINE: 782, BOOK: Migration Crises and the Struct, KEYWORD: countri face similar opposit workplac enforc even establish cultur german govern step workplac check construct industri employ foreign despit percent unemploy rate among german construct worker
TEXT:  The increased enforcement was undermined when employers began contesting the judgments, and subcontractors began going out of business (Martin 2004).

TEXT:  The opposition to interior enforcement by employers signals a second source of ambivalence: states may also be ambivalent about the number of undocumented migrants within their borders, as we noted in our discussion about unwanted versus undocumented migrants in our introduction to this chapter., LINE: 784, BOOK: Migration Crises and the Struct, KEYWORD: opposit interior enforc employ signal second sourc ambival state may also ambival number undocu migrant within border note discuss unwant versu undocu migrant introduct chapter
TEXT:  States have a number of unilateral policy tools at their disposal to control immigration. However, the political motivation to use these tools effectively is not always present. Thus, ineffective unilateral action alone does not indicate that the state is unable to act unilaterally, nor does it indicate that the state will pursue cooperation with other states., LINE: 785, BOOK: Migration Crises and the Struct, KEYWORD: state number unilater polici tool dispos control immigr howev polit motiv use tool effect alway present thu ineffect unilater action alon doe indic state unabl act unilater doe indic state pursu state
TEXT:  If there is ambivalence about the goal of restricting and controlling immigration, the state may be satisfied with the status quo of ineffective control. If the ambivalence is primarily about the method of control, states may seek to cooperate with other states as an alternative policy implementation., LINE: 786, BOOK: Migration Crises and the Struct, KEYWORD: ambival goal immigr state may satisfi statu quo ineffect control ambival primarili method control state may seek state altern polici implement
TEXT:  In this sense, cooperating with sending and transit states on issues of control is an extension of the border control method of enforcement, which focuses on preventing unauthorized entry. If interior enforcement provokes the most political opposition as citizens are confronted with the costs of immigration control, then outsourcing control to sending and transit states might provoke the least political opposition., LINE: 787, BOOK: Migration Crises and the Struct, KEYWORD: sens send transit state issu control extens border control method enforc focu unauthor entri interior enforc polit opposit citizen cost immigr control control send transit state might provok least polit opposit
TEXT:  The degree to which receiving states pursue cooperation with sending and transit states will thus be a reflection not only of the ability of the receiving state to act unilaterally, but of the underlying political will to actually control migration., LINE: 788, BOOK: Migration Crises and the Struct, KEYWORD: degre state pursu send transit state thu reflect abil state act unilater underli polit actual control migrat
TEXT:  However, when receiving states do decide to act, sending, transit, and receiving states share few common interests in reducing the undocumented migrant population through deportation.

TEXT:  In other words, the preferences of sending and receiving states diverge. In the contemporary era, it is sending states that prefer the status quo—in which migrants attempt to avoid deportation by eluding control agencies and by destroying identity documents when confronting control agencies., LINE: 790, BOOK: Migration Crises and the Struct, KEYWORD: word prefer send state diverg contemporari era send state prefer statu quo migrant attempt avoid deport control agenc ident document control agenc
TEXT:  Transit states refuse the return of noncitizens and sending states adopt delaying tactics when confronting the return of their citizens. It is receiving states that prefer a change in the status quo. There are no collective action or coordination problems that these states can work together to solve., LINE: 791, BOOK: Migration Crises and the Struct, KEYWORD: transit state refus return noncitizen send state adopt delay tactic return citizen state prefer chang statu quo collect action problem state work togeth solv
TEXT:  In the face of conflicting interests, the only possibility for cooperation lies in quid pro quo bargaining. In exchange for sending and transit states’ cooperation in controlling migration, receiving states must offer side payments., LINE: 792, BOOK: Migration Crises and the Struct, KEYWORD: face conflict interest possibl lie quid pro quo exchang send transit state migrat state must offer side payment
TEXT:  In cases where receiving states truly want to reduce their undocumented migrant population, two conditions will make cooperation more likely. The first relates to the cost of unwanted migration for the receiving states; the more costly unwanted migrants are, the more likely it is that cooperation will emerge., LINE: 793, BOOK: Migration Crises and the Struct, KEYWORD: case state truli want reduc undocu migrant popul two condit make like first cost unwant migrat state costli unwant migrant like emerg
TEXT:  This cost is greater when the bundle of rights to which migrants have access in the host society is greater. When immigrants cannot be excluded from social welfare benefits such education, health care, and income support, receiving states will be more likely to cooperate with sending states., LINE: 794, BOOK: Migration Crises and the Struct, KEYWORD: cost greater bundl right migrant access host societi greater immigr cannot social welfar benefit educ health care incom support state like send state
TEXT:  These costs are mitigated by a robust economy and exacerbated by a faltering one. The second condition relates to international restrictions on unilateral immigration control. When states are restricted in their ability to implement unilateral control policies, they are more likely to seek cooperative alternatives., LINE: 795, BOOK: Migration Crises and the Struct, KEYWORD: cost robust economi falter one second condit intern restrict unilater immigr control state restrict abil implement unilater control polici like seek altern
TEXT:  The most extreme example of this type of loss of control is found in Europe, where states have voluntarily relinquished some sovereignty over border control by granting citizens of member states free movement and by joining the Schengen Agreement, which limits external border controls., LINE: 796, BOOK: Migration Crises and the Struct, KEYWORD: extrem exampl type loss control found state voluntarili sovereignti border control citizen member state free movement join agreement limit extern border control
TEXT:  Consequently, we see the most formalized cooperation on migration control emerging in Europe in the form of readmission agreements.

TEXT:  When formal cooperation occurs, it is likely to be bilateral, because bilateral migration profiles are unique and quid pro cooperation requires side payments. To minimize costs for the receiving states, they will prefer to negotiate with each state separately, offering the minimum incentive to elicit cooperation., LINE: 798, BOOK: Migration Crises and the Struct, KEYWORD: formal like bilater bilater migrat profil uniqu quid pro side payment minim cost state prefer negoti state separ offer minimum incent elicit
TEXT:  In informal cooperation, the format will be much more flexible and there may be multilateral participation.

TEXT:  Yet, despite the existence of the UN ILO and the IOM, there is little systematic interstate cooperation to facilitate the movement of labor.

TEXT:  Moreover, bilateral and regional agreements that have proliferated on issues of trade and capital flows often exclude issues of migration.

TEXT:  In the post–World War II period, market mechanisms and private actors are the primary forces facilitating migration, obviating the need for cooperation. Receiving states control migration unilaterally, sorting migrants in terms of numbers, characteristics, length of stay, and rights upon arrival while sending states are constrained by international law to allow their citizens to leave., LINE: 818, BOOK: Migration Crises and the Struct, KEYWORD: post world war period market mechan privat actor primari forc migrat need state control migrat unilater migrant term number characterist length stay right upon arriv send state constrain intern law allow citizen leav
TEXT:  Authoritarian regimes have sometimes sidestepped the latter international norm, but fewer and fewer states now control exit. The status quo is preferred by the powerful receiving states, and governments rarely negotiate to facilitate the movement of labor., LINE: 819, BOOK: Migration Crises and the Struct, KEYWORD: authoritarian regim sometim latter intern norm state control exit statu quo prefer power state govern rare negoti facilit movement labor
TEXT:  Even sending states may benefit from and prefer the status quo when the demand for labor in international markets is strong. Nonetheless, there are conditions under which states do seek to facilitate migration by negotiating and concluding international agreements., LINE: 820, BOOK: Migration Crises and the Struct, KEYWORD: even send state may benefit prefer statu quo demand labor intern market strong nonetheless condit state seek facilit migrat conclud intern agreement
TEXT:  First, as developed in chapter 1, where agreements exist, they will be predominantly bilateral. Even when the unmet demand for labor in a specific country is large, it is not infinite. The costs of maintaining a multilateral regime, which provides uniform access to domestic labor markets, are substantially higher than the transaction costs of negotiating a few bilateral agreements., LINE: 821, BOOK: Migration Crises and the Struct, KEYWORD: first chapter agreement exist predominantli bilater even unmet demand labor specif countri larg infinit cost multilater regim uniform access domest labor market substanti higher transact cost bilater agreement
TEXT:  Second, as developed in chapter 2, powerful receiving states are usually satisfied with the status quo of unilateral action, since labor demands can usually be met through market mechanisms; only on rare occasions does a state fail to meet its labor market needs when it simply unilaterally removes restrictions to immigration., LINE: 822, BOOK: Migration Crises and the Struct, KEYWORD: second chapter power state usual satisfi statu quo unilater action sinc labor demand usual met market mechan rare occas doe state fail meet labor market need simpli unilater remov restrict immigr
TEXT:  Third, this status quo may be challenged by powerful receiving states only when exogenous shocks create very specific conditions: high labor market demand that cannot be met domestically and labor market failures that cannot be overcome by private sector actors., LINE: 823, BOOK: Migration Crises and the Struct, KEYWORD: third statu quo may power state exogen shock creat specif condit high labor market demand cannot met domest labor market failur cannot overcom privat sector actor
TEXT:  This increases the cost of the status quo for receiving states and triggers international negotiations. In this instance, sending states are likely to extract concessions from receiving states. Fourth, less powerful sending states may wish to negotiate for broader access to international labor markets, but they have neither found nor created an institutional forum within which to negotiate access., LINE: 824, BOOK: Migration Crises and the Struct, KEYWORD: increas cost statu quo state trigger intern negoti instanc send state like extract concess state fourth less power send state may wish negoti access intern labor market neither found institut forum within negoti access
TEXT:  We begin with an overview of the status quo ante that combines the right of departure with national sovereignty over admissions. We then present the preferences of sending and receiving states, which demonstrates an alignment of the state preferences, a preference for the status quo., LINE: 825, BOOK: Migration Crises and the Struct, KEYWORD: begin overview statu quo ant combin right departur nation sovereignti admiss present prefer send state align state prefer prefer statu quo
TEXT:  We then discuss how market mechanisms and private networks work to equilibrate labor market supply and demand across international borders and the conditions under which markets fail. The demand for cooperation, the exogenous shock that triggers efforts to cooperate internationally, comes from receiving states when the demand for labor exceeds the supply, due to informational asymmetries between employers’ demand for labor and the available international supply., LINE: 826, BOOK: Migration Crises and the Struct, KEYWORD: discu market mechan privat network work equilibr labor market suppli demand across intern border condit market fail demand exogen shock trigger effort intern come state demand labor suppli due inform asymmetri employ demand labor avail intern suppli

TEXT:  We argue that multilateral cooperation is never warranted in meeting limited labor market demands. GATS Mode 4 is the sole multilateral forum that implicates international migration, but it is narrowly tailored to avoid access to the domestic labor markets of receiving states., LINE: 828, BOOK: Migration Crises and the Struct, KEYWORD: argu multilater never warrant meet limit labor market demand gat mode sole multilater forum intern migrat narrowli avoid access domest labor market state
TEXT:  Sending states have been unable to leverage this institutional forum to address the issue because, even though sending states are a numerical majority, consensus decision rules prevent sending states from capturing the bargaining agenda., LINE: 829, BOOK: Migration Crises and the Struct, KEYWORD: send state unabl leverag institut forum address issu even though send state numer major consensu decis rule prevent send state agenda
TEXT:  Regional agreements represent a more promising venue for negotiating cooperation on migration but are limited to regions that have similar wages, working conditions, and standards of living. These conditions promote reciprocal flows that improve labor market efficiency while avoiding charges that may accrue to the state., LINE: 830, BOOK: Migration Crises and the Struct, KEYWORD: region agreement repres promis venu migrat limit region similar wage work condit standard live condit promot reciproc flow improv labor market effici charg may accru state
TEXT:  We examine twenty-eight regional economic organizations (REOs) and provide evidence that only those regions with similar levels of wealth have negotiated freedom of movement.1 Those cases are detailed in chapter 5., LINE: 831, BOOK: Migration Crises and the Struct, KEYWORD: examin twenti eight region econom organ provid evid region similar level wealth freedom movement case detail chapter
TEXT:  Otherwise, regional cooperation on migration is absent. Finally, we turn to BLAs, the dominant form of interstate cooperation to facilitate migration in response to labor market demands. Because a universal repository does not exist, we provide evidence from an OECD survey (OECD 2004) and from a more recent global survey by the ILO that suggests that few agreements are negotiated and that more recently BLAs are turning into immigration control agreements in which labor market access in the receiving state becomes a reward for sending state control over managing undocumented flows (Wickramasekara 2015)., LINE: 832, BOOK: Migration Crises and the Struct, KEYWORD: otherwis region migrat absent final turn bla domin form interst facilit migrat respons labor market demand univers repositori doe exist provid evid survey recent global survey agreement recent bla turn immigr control agreement labor market access state becom reward send state control undocu flow
TEXT:  Thus, although the name of the agreement remains unchanged, BLAs are shifting from facilitating to controlling migration. We provide case study evidence that is consistent with our hypotheses that the agreements are necessary only when market failures are not resolved through private actors., LINE: 833, BOOK: Migration Crises and the Struct, KEYWORD: thu although name agreement remain unchang bla shift migrat provid case studi evid consist hypothesi agreement necessari market failur resolv privat actor
TEXT:  Before concluding, we evaluate our analysis against other accounts of the phenomenon. In the conclusions, we draw from the theoretical propositions to point out that sending states, by empowering private actors to facilitate migration, are giving up potential leverage they may have when negotiating with receiving states to improve the lives of their citizens abroad., LINE: 834, BOOK: Migration Crises and the Struct, KEYWORD: conclud evalu analysi account phenomenon conclus draw theoret proposit point send state privat actor facilit migrat give potenti leverag may state improv life citizen abroad
TEXT:  In examining facilitation of international migration, we make a distinction between freedom of movement and labor recruitment. Freedom of movement agreements allow citizens of member states to seek employment in any of the member states at any time., LINE: 835, BOOK: Migration Crises and the Struct, KEYWORD: examin facilit intern migrat make distinct freedom movement labor recruit freedom movement agreement allow citizen member state seek employ member state time
TEXT: 2 Labor recruitment, on the other hand, is associated with limited entry in response to specific labor market shortages that cannot be met through domestic labor markets. Quotas may govern the number of admissions or employers may be required to demonstrate the lack of qualified workers in the domestic labor force., LINE: 836, BOOK: Migration Crises and the Struct, KEYWORD: labor recruit hand associ limit entri respons specif labor market shortag cannot met domest labor market quota may govern number admiss employ may demonstr lack qualifi worker domest labor forc
TEXT:  Work and residence permits are also employed as mechanisms of control to ensure that migrants come when needed and go when demand subsides. It is not the open door policy associated with freedom of movement., LINE: 837, BOOK: Migration Crises and the Struct, KEYWORD: work resid permit also employ mechan control ensur migrant come demand open door polici associ freedom movement
TEXT:  Governments seek to retain control over the type and number of entries, as well as the length of stay. In this chapter, we address labor recruitment. In chapter 5 we deal with freedom of movement. Research on labor recruitment often distinguishes between high-skilled and low-skilled labor., LINE: 838, BOOK: Migration Crises and the Struct, KEYWORD: govern seek retain control type number entri well length stay chapter address labor recruit chapter deal freedom movement research labor recruit often high skill low skill labor
TEXT:  There are a number of reasons why this disaggregation of labor flows might be useful analytically. Although many states, including some states in the Global South, attempt to reduce low-skilled migration and enhance high-skilled migration, the demand for both high-skilled and low-skilled workers remains strong., LINE: 839, BOOK: Migration Crises and the Struct, KEYWORD: number reason disaggreg labor flow might use analyt although mani state state global south attempt reduc low skill migrat enhanc high skill migrat demand high skill low skill worker remain strong
TEXT:  Many of the jobs that nationals no longer want, the “dirty, dangerous, and difficult” jobs as well as the many “care” jobs that arise from aging populations and women’s participation in the formal labor force, are filled by migrant labor and are classified as unskilled., LINE: 840, BOOK: Migration Crises and the Struct, KEYWORD: mani job nation longer want dirti danger difficult job well mani care job aris age popul woman particip formal labor forc fill migrant labor classifi unskil
TEXT:  At the same time, there appears to be a “competition for the best and the brightest,” individuals with tertiary degrees, to spur innovation and economic growth. Because demand remains strong but states privilege high-skilled over low-skilled migration, analysts argue that the domestic politics of high- and low-skilled migration appear to mobilize different constituencies with different outcomes in terms of policies adopted (Cerna 2009)., LINE: 841, BOOK: Migration Crises and the Struct, KEYWORD: time competit best individu tertiari degre spur innov econom growth demand remain strong state privileg high skill low skill migrat analyst argu domest polit high low skill migrat appear mobil differ constitu differ outcom term polici adopt
TEXT:  However, for our purposes, this distinction is less significant. When the explanatory variable of interest is cooperation among states, the skill level required by employers should not affect the trajectory of states., LINE: 842, BOOK: Migration Crises and the Struct, KEYWORD: howev purpos distinct less signific explanatori variabl interest among state skill level employ affect trajectori state
TEXT:  Once a policy choice is adopted, states can choose to act unilaterally to achieve that policy objective or to cooperate with other states, bilaterally, regionally, or multilaterally. Thus our discussion makes reference to high-skilled and low-skilled labor only insofar as they represent different state preferences for migrant labor and may thus be reflected in the content of the negotiated agreements., LINE: 843, BOOK: Migration Crises and the Struct, KEYWORD: polici choic adopt state choos act unilater achiev polici object state bilater region multilater thu discuss make refer high skill low skill labor insofar repres differ state prefer migrant labor may thu reflect content agreement
TEXT:  STATUS QUO ANTE AND STATE PREFERENCES The Status Quo Ante.

TEXT:  Chetail summarizes these principles in Table 4.1. The first principle to note is the right of citizens to leave and return to their country of origin. Without this principle, there could be no international migration., LINE: 845, BOOK: Migration Crises and the Struct, KEYWORD: principl tabl first principl note right citizen leav return countri origin without principl could intern migrat
TEXT:  It is central to the notion of human rights and personal liberty—the ability to control one’s own destiny. Jurists noted this as part of the development of the law of nations as early as the fifteenth century, when Europeans began to spread around the globe (Chetail 2014)., LINE: 846, BOOK: Migration Crises and the Struct, KEYWORD: central notion human right person liberti abil control one destini jurist note part develop law nation earli fifteenth centuri spread around globe
TEXT:  Of course, the opposing principle is national sovereignty over entry. “The competence of States to regulate the entry of non-citizens is traditionally considered as a well-established principle of positive international law” (Chetail 2014, 27)., LINE: 847, BOOK: Migration Crises and the Struct, KEYWORD: cours oppos principl nation sovereignti entri compet state regul entri non citizen tradit consid well establish principl posit intern law
TEXT:  The legal rationale on which this principle is based is that of territorial sovereignty. It is echoed in much domestic jurisprudence, such as the oft-cited US Supreme Court case Nishimura Ekiu v. United States: “It is an accepted maxim of international law, that every sovereign nation has the power as inherent in sovereignty and essential to its self-preservation, to forbid the entrance of foreigners within its dominions, or to admit them only in such cases as it may see fit to prescribe., LINE: 848, BOOK: Migration Crises and the Struct, KEYWORD: legal rational principl base territori sovereignti much domest jurisprud oft suprem court case unit state accept maxim intern law everi sovereign nation ha power inher sovereignti essenti self preserv forbid entranc foreign within dominion admit case may see fit prescrib

TEXT:  Torpey (2000) provides a historical overview of the evolution in Europe from a feudal system that bound peasants to the land to a system of relatively free movement beginning with the French Revolution and expanding across the European continent in the nineteenth century, before passports and immigration control became the norm in the early twentieth century., LINE: 851, BOOK: Migration Crises and the Struct, KEYWORD: histor overview evolut feudal system bound peasant land system rel free movement begin revolut expand across contin nineteenth centuri passport immigr control norm earli twentieth centuri
TEXT:  Nonetheless, the system of passports and immigration control has been firmly in place since well before World War II (Torpey 2000; Salter 2003). Thus, the status quo in the post–World War II international system recognizes both the right to leave one’s country of origin and the (constrained) national sovereignty of states to govern entry., LINE: 852, BOOK: Migration Crises and the Struct, KEYWORD: nonetheless system passport immigr control ha firmli place sinc well world war salter thu statu quo post world war intern system right leav one countri origin constrain nation sovereignti state govern entri
TEXT:  This status quo allows receiving states to choose both the number and type of immigrants for entry regardless of the preferences of sending states. It is not an unlimited sovereignty, as it is constrained by states’ commitments to international treaties to not refoule individuals defined in international treaties as persecuted as well as to protect the special rights of children in terms of family reunion., LINE: 853, BOOK: Migration Crises and the Struct, KEYWORD: statu quo state choos number type immigr entri regardless prefer send state unlimit sovereignti constrain state commit intern treati individu defin intern treati well protect special right child term famili reunion

TEXT:  Outside of the imperative of ensuring state territorial security, the interests of states in the international system are often opaque. Here we posit that receiving states have two imperatives. The first originates in the imperative of ensuring territorial integrity., LINE: 855, BOOK: Migration Crises and the Struct, KEYWORD: outsid imper state territori secur interest state intern system often opaqu posit state two imper first imper territori integr
TEXT:  The second is an interest in efficiently functioning labor markets that promote economic growth and contribute to the state’s legitimacy (Zolberg 2006). The sovereign right of territorial integrity includes control over entry, which permits the state to define its citizen population., LINE: 856, BOOK: Migration Crises and the Struct, KEYWORD: second interest effici labor market promot econom growth contribut state legitimaci sovereign right territori integr control entri permit state defin citizen popul
TEXT:  To quote Nishimura Ekiu again, this attribute is central to the state’s “self-preservation.” The inability to control entry, in the extreme, allows other states to invade and conquer. So control over entry is part and parcel of ensuring territorial integrity., LINE: 857, BOOK: Migration Crises and the Struct, KEYWORD: quot attribut central state self preserv inabl control entri extrem state invad conquer control entri part parcel territori integr
TEXT:  And, in popular imagination, even peaceful entry of migrant populations in sufficiently large numbers can overwhelm the existing community (Wilders et al. 2015). Thus, receiving states have a preference for control over entry to the territory., LINE: 858, BOOK: Migration Crises and the Struct, KEYWORD: popular imagin even peac entri migrant popul suffici larg number overwhelm commun wilder thu state prefer control entri territori
TEXT:  The state’s interest in ensuring a functioning labor market, necessary for economic growth, moderates its preference for control over entry, since economic growth is an important component of a state’s legitimacy (Zolberg 2006; Rudolph 2003)., LINE: 859, BOOK: Migration Crises and the Struct, KEYWORD: state interest labor market necessari econom growth moder prefer control entri sinc econom growth import compon state legitimaci

TEXT:  However, international migrants can also meet labor market demands. In both of these scenarios, the labor shortage state has an interest in expanding its labor supply. As Kindleberger (1967) explains in describing Europe’s postwar economic growth, an expanding labor supply moderates wage increases and induces additional investment, creating a positive cycle of economic growth., LINE: 865, BOOK: Migration Crises and the Struct, KEYWORD: howev intern migrant also meet labor market demand scenario labor shortag state ha interest expand labor suppli postwar econom growth expand labor suppli moder wage increas addit invest posit cycl econom growth
TEXT:  If economic growth is one component of state legitimacy, then receiving states have an interest in moderating labor markets. One means of doing so is through international migration. If receiving states are attentive to the efficient functioning of labor markets as well as territorial integrity, these states should prefer a system that allows them to pick and choose the number and characteristics of migrants., LINE: 866, BOOK: Migration Crises and the Struct, KEYWORD: econom growth one compon state legitimaci state interest labor market one mean intern migrat state attent effici labor market well territori integr state prefer system pick choos number characterist migrant

We do not suggest that receiving states actually have the capacity to completely control the level and characteristics of international migrants that maximize labor market efficiency, only that these two criteria determine receiving state preferences., LINE: 867, BOOK: Migration Crises and the Struct, KEYWORD: enhanc labor market effici well protect territori integr suggest state actual capac complet control level characterist intern migrant maxim labor market effici two criterion determin state prefer
TEXT:  The central preference of receiving states is the retention of national sovereignty over entry—the ability to determine the permissible number of immigrants and to sort those immigrants on the desired characteristics and to determine the length of stay., LINE: 868, BOOK: Migration Crises and the Struct, KEYWORD: central prefer state retent nation sovereignti entri abil determin permiss number immigr sort immigr desir characterist determin length stay
TEXT:  This preference is consistent with the status quo ante. Preferences of Sending States.

TEXT:  Second, the potential for high-skilled emigration can stimulate additional public and private investments in human capital in the country of origin, which promotes economic growth.

TEXT: 8 INTERNATIONAL COOPERATION TO FACILITATE MIGRATION For much of the post–World War II period, the preferences of both sending and receiving states supported the status quo, that is, individuals are free to leave their home state in search of a better life and receiving states are free to accept as many migrants as they choose, of any characteristic and for any duration of stay, turning away those they do not want., LINE: 877, BOOK: Migration Crises and the Struct, KEYWORD: intern facilit migrat much post world war period prefer send state statu quo individu free leav home state search better life state free accept mani migrant choos characterist durat stay turn away want

TEXT:  Market Failures and Labor Recruitment. There are two primary reasons that markets may fail to fulfill labor market needs. The first stems from informational asymmetries.

TEXT:  We know from the research on migrant networks that migrants themselves are often key to linking workers in the country of origin to employment in the host country (Massey 1987).

TEXT:  Therefore, we anticipate that as migrant networks increase, international agreements to facilitate labor migration will decrease. The second type of market failure stems from adjustment costs.

TEXT:  Where market mechanisms are deficient, receiving states respond to labor market pressures by negotiating agreements with migrant-sending states. Moreover, because labor market demands are ultimately limited, states negotiate bilaterally with a series of countries until the demand for labor is offset by a sufficient supply; at some point, private mechanisms, such as migrant networks and private recruitment agencies, may be able to keep up with demand., LINE: 896, BOOK: Migration Crises and the Struct, KEYWORD: market mechan defici state respond labor market pressur agreement migrant send state moreov labor market demand ultim limit state negoti bilater seri countri demand labor offset suffici suppli point privat mechan migrant network privat recruit agenc may abl keep demand
TEXT:  Thus, to facilitate labor migration, we anticipate bilateral agreements only under conditions of labor market pressures in the presence of information asymmetries and high adjustment costs.

TEXT:  Throughout the Uruguay Round, migrant-sending countries did not perceive GATS Mode 4 as a method of providing a market opening for their unskilled workers in developed country markets.

TEXT:  Exploring regional agreements that facilitate labor migration represents a minefield. There are at least three problems that arise. The first is that the number of REOs is growing. The literature acknowledges two waves of regionalization; the first wave provided the initial model of economic integration in Europe during the 1950s and led to the emulation of that agreement around the world in the 1960s and 1970s, as Europe prospered., LINE: 947, BOOK: Migration Crises and the Struct, KEYWORD: explor region agreement facilit labor migrat least three problem aris first number grow literatur two wave region first wave provid initi model econom integr led emul agreement around world
TEXT:  However, many of these agreements had become moribund by the 1980s. A second wave arose in the 1990s, with the widespread adoption of neoliberal economic policies in developing countries. The pressures of interdependence were compounded by the lack of progress on the WTO multilateral trade negotiations that began in Doha in 2001., LINE: 948, BOOK: Migration Crises and the Struct, KEYWORD: howev mani agreement becom moribund second wave aros widespread adopt econom polici countri pressur interdepend lack progress multilater trade negoti
TEXT:  Countries around the globe reinvigorated old regional agreements and drafted new ones. Thus, the number of regional agreements is constantly increasing, and each regional agreement is unique. The second problem is that the content of the regional agreements continues to shift., LINE: 949, BOOK: Migration Crises and the Struct, KEYWORD: countri around globe old region agreement new one thu number region agreement constantli increas region agreement uniqu second problem content region agreement shift
TEXT:  REOs are institutions that evolve as states negotiate new dimensions of integration. A free trade area can turn into a customs union and a customs union into a common market. Thus, it is difficult to keep track of the contents of the latest agreements, especially because the vocabulary takes on different meanings in different REOs: facilitation of movement, free circulation, freedom of movement, and rights of establishment can be narrowly or broadly defined to include or exclude rights of residence and access to the labor market., LINE: 950, BOOK: Migration Crises and the Struct, KEYWORD: institut evolv state negoti new dimens integr free trade area turn custom union custom union common market thu difficult keep track content latest agreement especi vocabulari take differ mean differ facilit movement free circul freedom movement right establish narrowli broadli defin includ exclud right resid access labor market
TEXT:  However, even if these problems are mastered, once agreements are negotiated, they are often not implemented. In some cases, states that have negotiated the agreements fail to ratify them, so they do not come into force., LINE: 951, BOOK: Migration Crises and the Struct, KEYWORD: howev even problem agreement often case state agreement fail ratifi come forc
TEXT:  And those that have come into force may not be fully implemented in ways that are often opaque. Moreover, regional agreements are often supplemented by bilateral agreements that create the actual rules under which workers from one state in an REO migrate to another state in the same organization., LINE: 952, BOOK: Migration Crises and the Struct, KEYWORD: come forc may fulli way often opaqu moreov region agreement often bilater agreement creat actual rule worker one state migrat anoth state organ

To add to the confusion, the provisions for facilitating mobility can take several forms., LINE: 953, BOOK: Migration Crises and the Struct, KEYWORD: nation legisl migratori movement intern even labor flow countri add confus provis mobil take sever form
TEXT:  The first is the adoption of visa-free entry and residence, usually for a period of ninety days. Many regional organizations have adopted measures such as these, but they preclude access to the local labor market so they do not represent access to labor mobility or migration, defined as residence in a host country for more than a year., LINE: 954, BOOK: Migration Crises and the Struct, KEYWORD: first adopt visa free entri resid usual period nineti day mani region organ adopt measur preclud access local labor market repres access labor mobil migrat defin resid host countri year
TEXT:  The second model is a GATS Mode 4–type agreement that reiterates or extends the WTO concessions to regional partners; again, generally, these do not represent access to labor markets and, hence, cannot be counted as agreements to facilitate labor migration., LINE: 955, BOOK: Migration Crises and the Struct, KEYWORD: second model gat mode type agreement concess region partner gener repres access labor market henc cannot agreement facilit labor migrat

TEXT:  Finally, there are freedom of movement provisions, often modeled on the “four freedoms” incorporated in the EU: freedom of movement for goods, services, capital, and labor. In principle, freedom of movement allows access to the labor markets to nationals of the member states., LINE: 957, BOOK: Migration Crises and the Struct, KEYWORD: final freedom movement provis often four freedom incorpor freedom movement good servic capit labor principl freedom movement access labor market nation member state
TEXT:  This freedom is generally abridged in some way; for example, even the EU allows job searches for only six months and only with adequate resources and medical insurance to prevent access to host state social services., LINE: 958, BOOK: Migration Crises and the Struct, KEYWORD: freedom gener abridg way exampl even job search six month adequ resourc medic insur prevent access host state social servic
TEXT:  Nonetheless, freedom of movement generally provides national treatment to citizens of member states when applying for jobs.

TEXT:  Nonetheless, we argue that, at present, disparities in wealth and working conditions are sufficiently large in most REOs so as to minimize the potential for actual implementation of labor mobility. Even where wealth and working conditions are similar, there must be an unfulfilled demand for labor to act as a trigger to initiate international negotiations to enhance international labor mobility., LINE: 960, BOOK: Migration Crises and the Struct, KEYWORD: nonetheless argu present dispar wealth work condit suffici larg minim potenti actual implement labor mobil even wealth work condit similar must unfulfil demand labor act trigger initi intern negoti enhanc intern labor mobil

TEXT:  Ours will not be the last word because, as noted above, these regional organizations are constantly evolving. There are at least three systemic factors within which REOs are constructed.

TEXT:  To facilitate international labor market recruitment, France negotiated agreements with Italy in 1946 and 1951, West Germany in 1950, Greece in 1954, and Spain in 1961. Because an adequate supply of foreign workers was still lacking, the government reached farther afield to Portugal and Morocco (1963), Tunisia (1964), and Turkey and Yugoslavia (1965) (Money 1999)., LINE: 1038, BOOK: Migration Crises and the Struct, KEYWORD: facilit intern labor market recruit agreement west adequ suppli foreign worker wa still govern farther afield morocco turkey money

TEXT:  These agreements provide temporary migration quotas of ten to three hundred places annually for efforts to quell undocumented migration or as a reward for signing a bilateral readmission agreement.

TEXT:  The modest protections provided for migrant labor in the European BLAs of the 1950s and 1960s are almost completely missing from the third wave of BLAs.

TEXT:  The survey by the ILO provides only a slightly rosier picture in the larger survey of 144 BLAs.

TEXT:  In chapter 7, on migrant rights, we demonstrate a connection between the strength of domestic labor movements and the national protection of human rights to the rights of migrants.

TEXT:  The most recent spate of BLAs tends to emphasize immigration control rather than recruitment. Contemporary observers of BLAs often echo the comments of observers of first-wave BLAs. Martin (2011, 1), for example, notes, “So far BLAs have concerned only a very small share of total bilateral migration flows between the countries involved, their implementation has caused quite a lot of frustration in countries of origin and they have problems of sustainability and continuity over time., LINE: 1125, BOOK: Migration Crises and the Struct, KEYWORD: recent spate bla emphas immigr control rather recruit contemporari observ bla often echo comment observ first wave bla martin exampl note far bla concern small share total bilater migrat flow countri involv implement ha quit lot frustrat countri origin problem continu time

TEXT:  This is likely because of the perception that, in the contemporary period, receiving states desire fewer migrants than sending states would like to export (Joppke 1998). However, generically, economists point to the global welfare gains of relaxing immigration restrictions and to the externalities that incentivize cooperation., LINE: 1127, BOOK: Migration Crises and the Struct, KEYWORD: like percept contemporari period state desir migrant send state would like export howev gener economist point global welfar gain immigr restrict extern
TEXT:  These gains are not trivial. Hamilton and Whalley (1984) posit that global gross domestic product would double if states opened their doors to migration. Dani Rodrik (2002) argues that facilitating migration should be central to the global negotiating agenda as the gains from migration are expected to be twenty-five times higher than continued reduction of barriers to trade., LINE: 1128, BOOK: Migration Crises and the Struct, KEYWORD: gain trivial posit global gross domest product would doubl state door migrat migrat central global agenda gain migrat twenti five time higher continu reduct barrier trade
TEXT:  The potential for global welfare gains motivates the research on cooperation on migration policies. Timothy Hatton (2007) provides an important overview of the possibilities for international cooperation on migration., LINE: 1129, BOOK: Migration Crises and the Struct, KEYWORD: potenti global welfar gain research migrat polici timothi import overview possibl intern migrat
TEXT:  He explores the parallels between trade and migration and points out that the key difference between the two is not public attitudes toward trade and migration—on both issues the public is skeptical of greater openness—but the fact that trade is based on comparative advantage and generates reciprocal flows (globally) whereas migration is based on absolute advantage (based on total factor productivity), which generates one-way flows and a lack of reciprocity., LINE: 1130, BOOK: Migration Crises and the Struct, KEYWORD: parallel trade migrat point key differ two public attitud toward trade migrat issu public skeptic greater open fact trade base compar advantag reciproc flow global wherea migrat base absolut advantag base total factor product one way flow lack reciproc
TEXT:  The absence of reciprocity reduces the likelihood of international cooperation on migration (Axelrod 1985). Hatton reviews four possible solutions—issue linkage, regional agreements, temporary migration, and multilateral agreements, although his multilateral scheme precludes entry rights of any type., LINE: 1131, BOOK: Migration Crises and the Struct, KEYWORD: absenc reciproc likelihood intern migrat review four possibl solut issu linkag region agreement temporari migrat multilater agreement although multilater scheme entri right type
TEXT:  However, he is pessimistic that any of these will provide the desired international cooperation. Although we agree with Hatton’s observation that flows are one-way, we draw different conclusions. First, we believe the one-way flows are central to the pattern of externalities that arise and that privilege bilateral rather than multilateral cooperation., LINE: 1132, BOOK: Migration Crises and the Struct, KEYWORD: howev pessimist provid desir intern although agre observ flow one way draw differ conclus first believ one way flow central pattern extern aris privileg bilater rather multilater
TEXT:  Second, we agree that reciprocity facilitates cooperation, but the absence of reciprocity does not prevent cooperation—rather we describe two conditions under which cooperation is likely to arise: when the costs of the status quo become costly for receiving states (resulting in either bilateral recruitment agreements or freedom of movement agreements) and when sending states find an institutional forum where they can catapult their preferences to the international stage., LINE: 1133, BOOK: Migration Crises and the Struct, KEYWORD: second agre reciproc absenc reciproc doe prevent rather describ two condit like aris cost statu quo becom costli state result either bilater recruit agreement freedom movement agreement send state find institut forum catapult prefer intern stage
TEXT:  Our model can explain when and where the appearance and the actuality of cooperation on migration arise, whereas Hatton’s model remains skeptical of the possibility of cooperation. Alan Sykes (2013) also focuses on the “one-way problem., LINE: 1134, BOOK: Migration Crises and the Struct, KEYWORD: model explain appear actual migrat aris wherea model remain skeptic possibl alan also focu one way problem
TEXT: ” He begins his presentation with a series of externalities generated by migration: a “terms of trade” externality, the costs of unilateral enforcement of national migration laws, and spillover effects in other receiving countries by shifting immigration flows to them., LINE: 1135, BOOK: Migration Crises and the Struct, KEYWORD: begin present seri extern migrat term trade extern cost unilater enforc nation migrat law effect countri shift immigr flow
TEXT: 27 These externalities are welfare reducing; therefore cooperation represents the potential for welfare enhancement. Sykes argues that the greatest obstacle to cooperation is the “one-way problem,” the fact that migratory flows move from poor states to wealthy states., LINE: 1136, BOOK: Migration Crises and the Struct, KEYWORD: extern welfar reduc therefor potenti welfar enhanc obstacl one way problem fact migratori flow move poor state wealthi state
TEXT:  It then becomes difficult to negotiate a cooperative solution that leaves both sides of the bargain better off. Nonetheless, migration externalities reduce global welfare because “governments tend to consider the benefits of policy to their own citizens and constituents but tend to ignore or discount the effects of their policy choices on foreigners., LINE: 1137, BOOK: Migration Crises and the Struct, KEYWORD: becom difficult negoti solut leaf side bargain better nonetheless migrat extern reduc global welfar govern tend consid benefit polici citizen constitu tend ignor discount effect polici choic foreign

TEXT:  Like Hatton, Sykes cites the potential for issue linkage, regional agreements for countries with similar levels of development, and circular migration. And, like Hatton, Sykes suggests that sending countries may be unwilling to come to the bargaining table because it is the migrants themselves who are the primary beneficiaries of migration, rather than the home country government., LINE: 1139, BOOK: Migration Crises and the Struct, KEYWORD: like cite potenti issu linkag region agreement countri similar level develop circular migrat like send countri may unwil come tabl migrant primari beneficiari migrat rather home countri govern
TEXT:  There are a number of differences between the economists’ approaches to international cooperation on migration and ours. First is attention to the status quo and to state preferences for deviation from the status quo., LINE: 1140, BOOK: Migration Crises and the Struct, KEYWORD: number differ economist approach intern migrat first attent statu quo state prefer deviat statu quo
TEXT:  Economists’ arguments are constructed based on a notion of Pareto efficient outcomes at the global level. However, global welfare is not central to national politicians’ political function. Although we “black box” the construction of state preferences for migration, we acknowledge that states may prefer high or low levels of migration, skilled or unskilled labor flows., LINE: 1141, BOOK: Migration Crises and the Struct, KEYWORD: economist argument base notion effici outcom global level howev global welfar central nation politician polit function although black box construct state prefer migrat acknowledg state may prefer high low level migrat skill unskil labor flow
TEXT:  The national preference functions recognize that even Pareto efficient outcomes at the national level are likely to divide the gains from bargaining unequally domestically. So these national migration preferences are not likely to generate global Pareto efficient outcomes., LINE: 1142, BOOK: Migration Crises and the Struct, KEYWORD: nation prefer function recogn even effici outcom nation level like divid gain unequ domest nation migrat prefer like gener global effici outcom
TEXT:  Second, the promise of a welfare-enhancing bargain does not necessarily lead states to the bargaining table. There are two reasons for this. First, the status quo privileges powerful receiving states, and less powerful sending states do not have the resources to bring receiving states to the bargaining table., LINE: 1143, BOOK: Migration Crises and the Struct, KEYWORD: second promis welfar bargain doe necessarili lead state tabl two reason first statu quo privileg power state less power send state resourc bring state tabl
TEXT:  Second, politicians do not want to disrupt the distribution of gains (costs) of migration that internal negotiations threaten. It is only when the costs of unilateral action rise that receiving states prefer to negotiate to change the status quo., LINE: 1144, BOOK: Migration Crises and the Struct, KEYWORD: second politician want disrupt distribut gain cost migrat intern negoti threaten cost unilater action rise state prefer negoti chang statu quo
TEXT:  One component of our explanation is very close to that proposed in a working paper by Margaret Peters (2013). She segregates a specific type of BLA from the many other types and labels it recruitment agreement., LINE: 1145, BOOK: Migration Crises and the Struct, KEYWORD: one compon explan close work paper peter segreg specif type mani type label recruit agreement
TEXT:  She argues that employers face two costs: vacancy costs and screening costs. Vacancy costs are those employers incur when they have insufficient workers to meet production goals. For example, with sufficient demand, a plant might be able to add a second or third shift to increase production but lack the workers to increase production., LINE: 1146, BOOK: Migration Crises and the Struct, KEYWORD: employ face two cost vacanc cost screen cost vacanc cost employ incur insuffici worker meet product goal exampl suffici demand plant might abl add second third shift increas product lack worker increas product
TEXT:  Likewise, when agricultural crops are ready for harvesting and there are insufficient workers for the harvest, the produce may rot in the fields. This is consistent with our observation that unmet labor market demands are the source of receiving state preferences to change the status quo., LINE: 1147, BOOK: Migration Crises and the Struct, KEYWORD: likewis agricultur crop readi insuffici worker harvest produc may rot field consist observ unmet labor market demand sourc state prefer chang statu quo
TEXT:  Screening costs, on the other hand, are closer to the informational asymmetries we refer to in our framework. That is, employers need workers with specific qualities, be they personal or skill-based. Workers know whether they have the required skills but have no incentive to share that information with employers, as then they might not receive the job offer., LINE: 1148, BOOK: Migration Crises and the Struct, KEYWORD: screen cost hand closer inform asymmetri refer framework employ need worker specif qualiti person skill base worker know whether skill incent share inform employ might receiv job offer
TEXT:  Peters argues that vacancy and screening costs generate the need for BLAs.

TEXT:  However, we emphasize the paucity of such agreements in the absence of market failures, even though we have similar ideas about the determinants recruitment agreements. Moreover, we point to the most recent wave of bilateral agreements as being more control-oriented rather than facilitating labor flows., LINE: 1150, BOOK: Migration Crises and the Struct, KEYWORD: howev emphas pauciti agreement absenc market failur even though similar idea determin recruit agreement moreov point recent wave bilater agreement control rather labor flow
TEXT:  CONCLUSIONS In this chapter, we have argued that when states are interested in facilitating international migratory flows, there is usually little need for international cooperation.

TEXT:  Nonetheless, we marshal evidence at the multilateral, regional, and bilateral levels. The central multilateral agreement that deals with the “movement of natural persons”—GATS Mode 4—is strongly anchored in the interests of wealthy Western states to sell services abroad and limits movement to high-skilled professionals for short periods., LINE: 1153, BOOK: Migration Crises and the Struct, KEYWORD: nonetheless marshal evid multilater region bilater level central multilater agreement deal movement natur person gat mode strongli anchor interest wealthi western state sell servic abroad limit movement high skill profession short period

TEXT:  REOs have some experience with freedom of movement but, as we have demonstrated in our survey of twenty-eight of them, freedom of movement is the exception rather than the rule. It exists only among nations of relatively equal wealth, which allows labor markets to work efficiently across national borders without generating large, unidirectional flows that generate costs for the state., LINE: 1155, BOOK: Migration Crises and the Struct, KEYWORD: experi freedom movement survey twenti eight freedom movement except rather rule among nation rel equal wealth labor market work effici across nation border without gener larg unidirect flow gener cost state
TEXT:  Bilateral agreements to facilitate flows are employed when states decide that international migration is a preferred solution to sectoral labor market shortages. They overcome incomplete markets due to informational asymmetries and adjustment costs by creating recruitment structures that match international migrants to job openings in receiving states and providing support for migrants to travel to these states and establish themselves., LINE: 1156, BOOK: Migration Crises and the Struct, KEYWORD: bilater agreement facilit flow employ state decid intern migrat prefer solut sector labor market shortag overcom incomplet market due inform asymmetri adjust cost recruit structur match intern migrant job open state provid support migrant travel state establish
TEXT:  Because of power imbalances, the contents of the agreements usually favor the receiving states’ interests in recruitment, although migrant protections are more often included when the receiving states in question have strong labor movements and themselves protect human rights (see chapter 7)., LINE: 1157, BOOK: Migration Crises and the Struct, KEYWORD: power imbal content agreement usual favor state interest recruit although migrant protect often includ state question strong labor movement protect human right see chapter

TEXT:  However, many recent agreements cannot be truly characterized as facilitating labor movement; rather, these agreements either condition labor market access on controlling undocumented migration or are a reward for signing readmission agreements that facilitate deportation from receiving countries to source or transit countries., LINE: 1159, BOOK: Migration Crises and the Struct, KEYWORD: howev mani recent agreement cannot truli labor movement rather agreement either condit labor market access undocu migrat reward readmiss agreement facilit deport countri sourc transit countri
TEXT:  This portrait of facilitating flows reflects the bargaining framework presented in chapter 2. The status quo provides receiving states the ability to determine the level and characteristics of international migrant inflows, so they prefer the status quo., LINE: 1160, BOOK: Migration Crises and the Struct, KEYWORD: portrait flow framework chapter statu quo state abil determin level characterist intern migrant inflow prefer statu quo
TEXT:  Sending states, too, tend to benefit from the status quo by allowing their citizens to emigrate in response to labor market demands in the international system. Where both sending and receiving states prefer the status quo, there is little need for international cooperation: a harmony of interests ensues., LINE: 1161, BOOK: Migration Crises and the Struct, KEYWORD: send state tend benefit statu quo citizen emigr respons labor market demand intern system send state prefer statu quo littl need intern harmoni interest
TEXT:  Thus, cooperation to facilitate migration flows is the exception rather than the rule. There are two conditions under which we would anticipate international cooperation. When receiving states experience unmet labor market demands, where informational asymmetries create market failures, receiving states may negotiate with sending states to facilitate labor migration., LINE: 1162, BOOK: Migration Crises and the Struct, KEYWORD: thu facilit migrat flow except rather rule two condit would anticip intern state experi unmet labor market demand inform asymmetri creat market failur state may negoti send state facilit labor migrat

TEXT:  Agreements are negotiated as a method of overcoming market failures and information asymmetries, in light of continuing labor market shortages. These agreements represent one method for sending states to extract concessions from receiving states and to enhance migrant rights protections but, given the asymmetries in power between sending and receiving states, these concessions are not a foregone conclusion., LINE: 1165, BOOK: Migration Crises and the Struct, KEYWORD: agreement method market failur inform asymmetri light labor market shortag agreement repres one method send state extract concess state enhanc migrant right protect given asymmetri power send state concess foregon conclus

TEXT:  The first is to open negotiations in multilateral arenas such as GATS negotiations—in which they have achieved no success—and in multilateral rights arenas such as the UN General Assembly—where, again, they have failed to bring receiving states to ratify migrant rights agreements that would equalize labor market access and treatment of undocumented migrants in receiving country labor markets., LINE: 1168, BOOK: Migration Crises and the Struct, KEYWORD: first open negoti multilater arena gat negoti success multilater right arena gener assembl bring state ratifi migrant right agreement would equal labor market access treatment undocu migrant countri labor market
TEXT:  There is at least one policy-relevant observation that emerges from this theoretical and empirical presentation. If, and when, sending states delegate to private actors, such as recruitment agencies, or authorize direct employer recruitment, they are facilitating the entry of private actors to improve the efficiency of international labor markets, ultimately reducing the unmet demand for migrants on the part of receiving states., LINE: 1169, BOOK: Migration Crises and the Struct, KEYWORD: least one polici relev observ theoret empir present send state deleg privat actor recruit agenc author direct employ recruit entri privat actor improv effici intern labor market ultim reduc unmet demand migrant part state

TEXT:  Europe is the central focus of our inquiry in this chapter, as there have been three distinct groups of states that have adopted freedom of movement in the twentieth century: the Nordic Common Labor Market (1945/1954), the Benelux Community (1926/1958), and the precursors to the EU (1952/1957)., LINE: 1184, BOOK: Migration Crises and the Struct, KEYWORD: central focu inquiri chapter three distinct group state adopt freedom movement twentieth centuri common labor market commun precursor

TEXT:  Our argument is complicated by attention to the institutional structures within which these bargains take place.

TEXT: 5 Alternatively, institutions can be flexible and allow states to renege on free movement when conditions change, as was the case with the TTTA (Krasner 1976).6 Although the term “freedom of movement” implies that citizens of member states party to such an agreement can move and live at will, freedom of movement in the international sphere is generally constrained in some way., LINE: 1193, BOOK: Migration Crises and the Struct, KEYWORD: altern institut flexibl allow state reneg free movement condit chang wa case although term freedom movement citizen member state parti agreement move live freedom movement intern sphere gener constrain way
TEXT:  A comparison to internal movement makes this distinction clear.

TEXT: 9 So international freedom of movement is not the same as internal freedom of movement.

TEXT:  Freedom of movement tends to ratify prior flows rather than initiate new flows. The basic difference in this chapter, as distinct from the examination of labor market recruitment in chapter 4, is that countries are not easily divided into sending and receiving states vis-à-vis each other., LINE: 1207, BOOK: Migration Crises and the Struct, KEYWORD: freedom movement ratifi prior flow rather initi new flow basic differ chapter distinct examin labor market recruit chapter countri easili divid send state

TEXT:  Rather than bilateral agreements between labor surplus and labor shortage countries that foresaw one-way movement, the conditions that generated potential reciprocity acknowledged that workers could and would move both ways; states could experience both net inflows and net outflows but, over time, net flows would converge toward zero., LINE: 1218, BOOK: Migration Crises and the Struct, KEYWORD: rather bilater agreement labor surplu labor shortag countri one way movement condit potenti reciproc acknowledg worker could would move way state could experi net inflow net outflow time net flow would converg toward zero

TEXT:  Sadly, there is very little literature in English that allows us to trace the negotiations on the creation of the Nordic Common Labor Market. However, we do know that only months after the war was concluded in Europe, the ministers for social affairs of the five governments met in Copenhagen in September 1945 and drafted a convention creating a common labor market, eliminating the need for a work permit or a residence permit for the citizens of member states (Wendt 1981)., LINE: 1238, BOOK: Migration Crises and the Struct, KEYWORD: sadli littl literatur trace negoti creation common labor market howev know month war wa minist social affair five govern met convent common labor market need work permit resid permit citizen member state

TEXT:  However, the council proposed the 1954 agreement that was adopted by the member state governments.

TEXT:  By 1954, the tightness of the Finnish and Norwegian labor market had slackened and diminished concerns about labor market shortages.

TEXT:  It is interesting to note, though, that the Nordic Common Labor Market is not nested inside an economic union; it appears that broader regional economic integration is not a necessary component of a regional agreement on freedom of movement., LINE: 1263, BOOK: Migration Crises and the Struct, KEYWORD: interest note though common labor market insid econom union region econom integr necessari compon region agreement freedom movement
TEXT:  THE BENELUX ECONOMIC UNION The Belgium-Netherlands-Luxembourg (Benelux) Treaty of Economic Union was signed in 1958 and came into force on 1 November 1960 based on a fifteen-year negotiation process that generated several conventions, protocols, and ad hoc ministerial agreements., LINE: 1264, BOOK: Migration Crises and the Struct, KEYWORD: econom union treati econom union wa came forc base fifteen year negoti process sever convent protocol ministeri agreement
TEXT:  Similar to the Nordic Common Labor Market, the agreement incorporated freedom of movement based on previously negotiated bilateral agreements. Although not all of the early bilateral agreements were nested inside an economic union, the multilateral agreement was clearly nested within an economic union based on the principle of a common market in goods, services, capital, and labor., LINE: 1265, BOOK: Migration Crises and the Struct, KEYWORD: similar common labor market agreement incorpor freedom movement base previous bilater agreement although earli bilater agreement insid econom union multilater agreement wa clearli within econom union base principl common market good servic capit labor
TEXT:  Efforts were initiated during World War II to create an economic union between the Netherlands and the Belgium-Luxembourg Economic Union (BLEU).25 The governments in exile in London concluded two agreements, the first a monetary convention signed on 21 October 1943, the second a customs union signed on 5 September 1944, with the idea that both would go into effect upon liberation., LINE: 1266, BOOK: Migration Crises and the Struct, KEYWORD: effort world war creat econom union econom union govern exil two agreement first monetari convent second custom union idea would effect upon liber
TEXT:  These initial conventions were to prepare for a “total economic union” (Gay and Wagret 1970, 118).

TEXT:  In 1951, a new protocol called for the convergence of tax policies and economic policies. The Treaty of Economic Union (1958) brought these various treaties and protocols together in a single document, with full effect in 1960 (Meade, Liesner, and Wells 1962)., LINE: 1269, BOOK: Migration Crises and the Struct, KEYWORD: new protocol converg tax polici econom polici treati econom union brought variou treati protocol togeth singl document full effect well
TEXT:  The labor market component of the Economic Union found precursors in earlier bilateral agreements. A labor mobility treaty was signed between Belgium and Luxembourg in 1926; Netherlands negotiated similar treaties with both Belgium and Luxembourg in 1933 (Eyck 1954; Robertson 1956)., LINE: 1270, BOOK: Migration Crises and the Struct, KEYWORD: labor market compon econom union found precursor bilater agreement labor mobil treati wa similar treati

TEXT:  Thus, the bilateral treaties granted privileged access to each other’s labor markets that did not depend on labor market conditions, but mobility was governed by work permits (Meade, Liesner, and Wells 1962)., LINE: 1272, BOOK: Migration Crises and the Struct, KEYWORD: thu bilater treati privileg access labor market depend labor market condit mobil wa work permit well
TEXT:  The free movement of workers was reconfirmed in a 1956 treaty specifically dealing with labor mobility and folded into the 1958 treaty.

TEXT:  Analysis. The evidence is consistent with our theoretical claims that freedom of movement requires similar levels of wealth and labor market demands.

TEXT:  But wealth disparities were small; the Dutch GDP per capita in real terms was 92 percent of its Belgian counterpart in 1955 (Heston, Summers, and Aten 2009).

TEXT:  As it turns out, even with freedom of movement inside the Benelux Economic Union, there was reciprocity but at very low levels of migration, in large part because wealth disparities were so small (Meade, Liesner, and Wells 1962, 11)., LINE: 1278, BOOK: Migration Crises and the Struct, KEYWORD: turn even freedom movement insid econom union wa reciproc low level migrat larg part wealth dispar small well

TEXT:  However, imbalances are even smaller in the Benelux Union—amounting to around a fifty thousand positive net balance in Belgium, a minuscule proportion of the total population. Table 5.4 presents the unemployment rate for Belgium for the period of economic union with Luxembourg and for the subsequent periods during which bilateral and multilateral agreements on freedom of movement were negotiated (unemployment rates for Luxembourg are unavailable)., LINE: 1280, BOOK: Migration Crises and the Struct, KEYWORD: howev imbal even smaller union around fifti thousand posit net balanc minuscul proport total popul tabl present unemploy rate period econom union subsequ period bilater multilater agreement freedom movement unemploy rate unavail
TEXT:  It is easy to see that the bilateral agreement between Belgium and Luxembourg in 1926 was adopted during a period of full employment. The bilateral agreements that the Netherlands negotiated with Belgium and with Luxembourg in 1933 are more puzzling as unemployment rates were very high in both Belgium and the Netherlands., LINE: 1281, BOOK: Migration Crises and the Struct, KEYWORD: easi see bilater agreement wa adopt period full employ bilater agreement puzzl unemploy rate high
TEXT:  However, this appears to be an outlier. Despite descriptions of Belgium as the more dynamic economy in the early postwar period, in the early 1950s Belgium had relatively high unemployment rates. However, those rates dropped rapidly in the mid-1950s, so by the time the multilateral agreement on freedom of movement of labor was negotiated in 1956, both Belgium and the Netherlands experienced full employment., LINE: 1282, BOOK: Migration Crises and the Struct, KEYWORD: howev outlier despit descript dynam economi earli postwar period earli rel high unemploy rate howev rate rapidli mid time multilater agreement freedom movement labor wa experienc full employ

TEXT:  Free movement for nationals of member states is part of the core EU objective of economic integration.26 Moreover, the geographic scope of freedom of movement expanded as the union itself broadened its membership from the original six member states of France, Germany, Italy, Belgium, the Netherlands, and Luxembourg to the now twenty-eight., LINE: 1285, BOOK: Migration Crises and the Struct, KEYWORD: free movement nation member state part core object econom integr moreov geograph scope freedom movement expand union membership origin six member state twenti eight

TEXT: 28 We begin with the ECSC, negotiated in 1950–51 and implemented in 1952. The ECSC forbade discrimination based on nationality for a subset of workers, skilled workers, in the coal and steel sectors of member states., LINE: 1287, BOOK: Migration Crises and the Struct, KEYWORD: begin forbad discrimin base nation subset worker skill worker coal steel sector member state
TEXT:  However, this treaty article neither promised nor created freedom of movement in these sectors. Earlier analyses suggest that these provisions were the basis for freedom of movement incorporated into the EEC in 1957 (Maas 2006; Money and Geddes 2011)., LINE: 1288, BOOK: Migration Crises and the Struct, KEYWORD: howev treati articl neither freedom movement sector analysi suggest provis basi freedom movement incorpor money
TEXT:  However, we show that the freedom of movement for workers incorporated in the 1957 treaty is quite distinct from the ECSC provisions and is closely associated with the Benelux experience. The EEC’s freedom of movement was expanded in the Treaty of Maastricht in 1992 to include citizens of the member states, rather than just workers, and allowed for conditional settlement of those citizens in any member state., LINE: 1289, BOOK: Migration Crises and the Struct, KEYWORD: howev show freedom movement worker incorpor treati quit distinct provis close associ experi freedom movement wa expand treati includ citizen member state rather worker condit settlement citizen member state
TEXT:  Freedom of movement, therefore, was constructed over several decades. We also emphasize the institutional constraints created by the evolution of the EU that forced member states to permit freedom of movement to new member states in 2004 and subsequent accessions, even though the underlying conditions we assert are necessary were, in fact, absent., LINE: 1290, BOOK: Migration Crises and the Struct, KEYWORD: freedom movement therefor wa sever decad also emphas institut constraint evolut forc member state permit freedom movement new member state subsequ access even though underli condit assert necessari fact absent
TEXT:  The European Coal and Steel Community. The story of the creation of the ECSC is well known.

TEXT:  The invitation for the negotiations focused on a customs union rather than a common market.

TEXT:  Maas (2003, 2006) reports that this clause was inserted at the insistence of the Italian negotiator as the price for Italian participation in the agreement. If this is true, the Italian delegation was hoodwinked, as Article 69 (1) clearly states, “The member States bind themselves to renounce any restriction based on nationality against the employment in the coal and steel industries of workers of proven qualifications for such industries who possess the nationality of one of the member States” (Treaty Constituting the European Coal and Steel Community 1951, emphasis added)., LINE: 1304, BOOK: Migration Crises and the Struct, KEYWORD: report claus wa insert insist negoti price particip agreement true deleg wa articl clearli state member state bind renounc restrict base nation employ coal steel industri worker proven qualif industri possess nation one member state treati coal steel commun emphasi ad
TEXT:  There were virtually no skilled coal miners in Italy, in the absence of coal deposits, and their steel industry was very small.

TEXT:  Additional evidence that the Benelux Union was the model for the EEC’s freedom of movement for labor comes from the wording of the treaty articles.

TEXT:  The Benelux countries had long experience, dating from 1926 and 1933, which permitted the free flow of workers, exclusive of economic union.

TEXT:  Therefore, transition provisions for access to EEC labor markets were built into the accession treaties (Maas 2006; Geddes and Boswell 2011).

TEXT:  If residence is to be for longer than six months, certain conditions can be imposed. These are interesting because they reveal the concern of EU member states to minimize the costs of free movement. To acquire a right of residence for more than six months, EU citizens must (1) be engaged in economic activity or be self-employed and (2) have sufficient resources, including health insurance, so that they do not become a burden on the member state that they move to; or (3) be following vocational training and have sufficient resources to support themselves; or (4) be a family member of an EU citizen who falls into one of these categories., LINE: 1370, BOOK: Migration Crises and the Struct, KEYWORD: resid longer six month certain condit interest reveal concern member state minim cost free movement acquir right resid six month citizen must engag econom activ self employ suffici resourc health insur becom burden member state move follow vocat train suffici resourc support famili member citizen fall one categori

TEXT:  In 2001, the TTTA was amended to restrict the ability of New Zealanders to become permanent residents, requiring all new arrivals to go through the same process as other immigrants. This means that they have to apply and meet the qualifications set for all immigrants to gain permanent resident status, which allows them to access social security benefits (after a two-year waiting period), to obtain citizenship, or to sponsor other immigrants (Birrell and Rapson 2001; Betts 2003)., LINE: 1408, BOOK: Migration Crises and the Struct, KEYWORD: wa restrict abil new becom perman resid new arriv process immigr mean appli meet qualif set immigr gain perman resid statu access social secur benefit two year wait period obtain citizenship sponsor immigr

TEXT:  The Australian government projected that annual welfare costs attributed to New Zealand immigrants would grow from A$930 million in 2000 to over A$1 billion in future years (Hoadley 2003).

TEXT:  These rising costs, compensation for which Australia started agitating in 1999, further increased concern about the Trans-Tasman relationship.

TEXT:  The result of the 2001 TTTA reforms, then, has not been to reduce the level of either overall migration from New Zealand or the percentage of Asians arriving from New Zealand.

TEXT:  For New Zealand, though, the 2001 amendment was not the solution to its own Trans-Tasman problem and, in fact, it has made it only more severe.

TEXT: 51 The first is labeled neoinstitutionalism and focuses on state interests (derived from domestic sources) and state power as explanatory variables.52 From this perspective, cooperation proceeds because one or more powerful states have an interest in cooperation and bargain with other states over the shape of that cooperation, bringing along less powerful states through side payments (Moravcsik 1998)., LINE: 1486, BOOK: Migration Crises and the Struct, KEYWORD: first focu state interest deriv domest sourc state power explanatori variabl perspect proce one power state interest bargain state shape along less power state side payment

TEXT:  To put it another way, the focus is on how policymaking elites in member states begin to adopt a European perspective on various issues, including migration and asylum. The theory incorporates the role of ideas and the political leaders who act as “moral entrepreneurs,” disseminating the new ideas to the political elite and cementing the idea in the broader population through social learning and socialization (Checkel 2001)., LINE: 1490, BOOK: Migration Crises and the Struct, KEYWORD: put anoth way focu elit member state begin adopt perspect variou issu migrat asylum theori role idea polit leader act moral entrepreneur new idea polit elit idea popul social learn social
TEXT:  The neoinstitutionalist framework comes closest to our argument. According to the major proponent of the neoinstitutionalist perspective on the construction of the EU, Moravcsik (1998) argues that when state interests converge, powerful states negotiate agreements to fulfil those interests, providing side payments to promote the cooperation of smaller states, though he does not provide an explanation of the origins of state interests, arguing only that they arise from domestic politics., LINE: 1491, BOOK: Migration Crises and the Struct, KEYWORD: framework come argument accord major propon perspect construct state interest converg power state negoti agreement interest provid side payment promot smaller state though doe provid explan origin state interest aris domest polit

TEXT:  Perhaps it is the “shared identity” of these states that permits them to relinquish sovereignty.

TEXT:  But although there is surely an informational advantage to concluding agreements with neighboring states, a constructivist framework has difficulty in identifying the timing of these agreements.

TEXT:  Similarly, the constructivist frame would be unable to determine the difference in outcomes between the ECSC in 1952 and the EEC in 1957. It also fails to explain why the TTTA, which confirms a centuries-old labor flow, would be modified unilaterally to constrict labor mobility in 2001., LINE: 1497, BOOK: Migration Crises and the Struct, KEYWORD: similarli constructivist frame would unabl determin differ outcom also explain centuri old labor flow would unilater constrict labor mobil
TEXT:  Common history, rather, works to inform the potential participants that the flows will be reciprocal rather than unilateral. The theory that fits least well with the evidence is the neofunctionalist argument that privileges substate and supranational actors in constructing integration., LINE: 1498, BOOK: Migration Crises and the Struct, KEYWORD: common histori rather work inform potenti particip flow reciproc rather unilater theori fit least well evid argument privileg supran actor integr
TEXT:  The neofunctionalist argument does not do a good job of explaining the rise of supranational actors in the first place. Once a treaty has been signed that creates supranational institutions, such as the High Authority in the case of the ECSC and the commission in the case of the EEC, these institutions and actors exist to facilitate the construction of additional elements of integration., LINE: 1499, BOOK: Migration Crises and the Struct, KEYWORD: argument doe good job explain rise supran actor first place treati ha supran institut high author case commiss case institut actor exist facilit construct addit element integr
TEXT:  There is no single set of established supranational actors as these freedom of movement agreements are negotiated.

TEXT:  Acosta Arcarazo and Geddes argue that material and ideational factors are important, while regional diffusion (between Europe and South America) is minimal. They cite patterns of migration in South America as the most important material factor: “a dramatic increase in the turn of the century in the number of South American emigrants, mainly to the US and Spain” as well as the fact that “immigration in South American countries shifted from being extra-continental until the 1960s to mainly intra-regional flows from the 1970s onward., LINE: 1514, BOOK: Migration Crises and the Struct, KEYWORD: argu materi ideat factor import region diffus south minim cite pattern migrat south import materi factor dramat increas turn centuri number south emigr mainli well fact immigr south countri extra continent mainli region flow onward

TEXT:  In the first instance, it reflects the changing patterns of migration away from unilateral flows to reciprocal flows (reinforced by decreased levels of cross-national inequality) (Cornia 2011).

TEXT:  Mattar (2013, 1) argues that combatting trafficking requires transnational cooperation on “the three EXs”: exchange of information, extraterritoriality, and extradition. The exchange of information allows law enforcement officials to better detect, deter, and prosecute criminal activities through “information sharing, collection of evidence, investigation of criminals who commit cross-border crimes, facilitating judicial cooperation, witness protection in criminal proceedings, substantive and procedural protective measures designed to assist trafficking victims, repatriation of victims, and reducing re-victimization” (Mattar 2013, 9)., LINE: 1599, BOOK: Migration Crises and the Struct, KEYWORD: transnat three ex exchang inform extradit exchang inform law enforc offici better detect deter prosecut crimin activ inform collect evid investig crimin commit cross border crime judici wit protect crimin proceed substant procedur protect measur design assist victim repatri victim reduc victim

TEXT:  The Trafficking and Smuggling Protocols had the support of a broad base of states, including powerful ones like the United States. But the debate over the language of the protocols quickly turned contentious as the Ad Hoc Committee met in a series of eleven sessions, which came to be known as the Vienna Process., LINE: 1628, BOOK: Migration Crises and the Struct, KEYWORD: smuggl protocol support broad base state power one like unit state debat languag protocol quickli turn contenti committe met seri eleven session came known process
TEXT:  The Ad Hoc Committee comprised state delegates involved in the UN crime control program, which usually receives little attention from the human rights and migration policy communities. However, the UNHCR and the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights mobilized human rights and migration IGOs and NGOs in an effort to shape the protocol in a way that would prioritize the rights of trafficked and smuggled migrants (Fitzpatrick 2003)., LINE: 1629, BOOK: Migration Crises and the Struct, KEYWORD: committe compris state deleg involv crime control program usual littl attent human right migrat polici commun howev high commission human right human right migrat effort shape protocol way would right migrant
TEXT:  The debates during the Vienna Process centered on two issues. The first issue was whether the trafficking and smuggling problem should be approached as a crime and border control issue or as a matter of state obligation to safeguard the human rights of trafficked and smuggled people., LINE: 1630, BOOK: Migration Crises and the Struct, KEYWORD: debat process center two issu first issu wa whether smuggl problem crime border control issu matter state oblig safeguard human right peopl
TEXT:  The second issue was whether or not the definition of trafficking should include migrants involved in “voluntary” prostitution (Chuang 2006). Sending states and their allies in the human rights and immigrant rights policy communities worked together to advocate for the human rights lens in the protocol, but their efforts had a very limited effect., LINE: 1631, BOOK: Migration Crises and the Struct, KEYWORD: second issu wa whether definit includ migrant involv voluntari prostitut send state alli human right immigr right polici commun work togeth advoc human right len protocol effort limit effect

TEXT:  The receiving states had no intention of signing anything that imposed new obligations, or expanded existing obligations, under international law. So while debate and discussion about the human rights aspects of trafficking and smuggling were plentiful during the Vienna Process, there was little hope that they would become part of the final agreement in any meaningful way., LINE: 1633, BOOK: Migration Crises and the Struct, KEYWORD: state intent anyth new oblig expand oblig intern law debat discuss human right aspect smuggl plenti process wa littl hope would becom part final agreement meaning way

TEXT:  One concession that the sending states and human rights activists did achieve is the inclusion of the protection of human rights as one of the three “purposes” of the Trafficking Protocol. States, however, are not obligated to do much to actually protect the rights of trafficking victims; they must only “endeavor” to provide for their safety, “ensure” that their domestic legal systems provide privacy for victims and the possibility for victims to seek compensation, “consider” cooperation with NGOs to provide services for trafficking victims, and “consider” measures to allow trafficking victims to remain in the country., LINE: 1635, BOOK: Migration Crises and the Struct, KEYWORD: one concess send state human right activist achiev inclus protect human right one three purpos protocol state howev much actual protect right victim must endeavor provid safeti ensur domest legal system provid privaci victim possibl victim seek compens consid provid servic victim consid measur allow victim remain countri
TEXT:  At the same time, receiving states are also free to arrest, prosecute, and deport trafficked or smuggled individuals. Sending states, however, do face obligations under the Palermo Protocols to accept the return of any trafficked or smuggled citizen or permanent resident; these obligations are stated in much more forceful language (Fitzpatrick 2003)., LINE: 1636, BOOK: Migration Crises and the Struct, KEYWORD: time state also free arrest prosecut deport individu send state howev face oblig protocol accept return citizen perman resid oblig state much forc languag

TEXT:  The second issue that generated divisions during the Vienna Process was the issue of “voluntary” prostitution. On this issue, the human rights community was divided, and it led to rancorous debate among the various representatives of human rights organizations, women’s organizations, and immigrant rights organizations participating in the process., LINE: 1638, BOOK: Migration Crises and the Struct, KEYWORD: second issu divis process wa issu voluntari prostitut issu human right commun wa divid led rancor debat among variou repres human right organ woman organ immigr right organ process

TEXT:  The caucus advocated for a distinction between trafficking and prostitution on the grounds that a migrant could, of her own free will, choose to engage in prostitution. The opposing bloc, led by the American-based Coalition Against Trafficking in Persons, argued that all prostitution was inherently coerced and thus all sex work should be considered trafficking in the protocol., LINE: 1640, BOOK: Migration Crises and the Struct, KEYWORD: caucu distinct prostitut ground migrant could free choos engag prostitut oppos bloc led base coalit person prostitut wa inher thu sex work consid protocol
TEXT:  This disagreement over the definition of trafficking in relation to prostitution so occupied the representatives of the various NGOs and IGOs at the Vienna Process that they were limited in their ability to find enough common ground to move onto other issues addressed in the protocol (Ditmore and Wijers 2003)., LINE: 1641, BOOK: Migration Crises and the Struct, KEYWORD: disagr definit relat prostitut repres variou process limit abil find enough common ground move onto issu protocol
TEXT:  The two blocs of NGOs found allies in the state delegations. Initially, Argentina (the original proponent of the Trafficking Protocol) and the Philippines sided with the antiprostitution bloc. On the other side, the United States took the lead in advocating for a more restrictive definition of trafficking that included only “forced” prostitution (Gallagher 2001)., LINE: 1642, BOOK: Migration Crises and the Struct, KEYWORD: two bloc found alli state deleg initi origin propon protocol side bloc side unit state took lead restrict definit includ forc prostitut
TEXT:  It eventually backed away from the position, at least publicly, most likely because of increasing domestic pressures (Bennett and Colson 2000). In the end, though, the Trafficking Protocol excluded consensual prostitution and cleverly avoided defining prostitution altogether, instead referring to “exploitation of prostitution of others” and “other forms of sexual exploitation,” leaving these terms up for interpretation by domestic legal systems (Chuang 2006)., LINE: 1643, BOOK: Migration Crises and the Struct, KEYWORD: eventu back away posit least publicli like increas domest pressur end though protocol consensu prostitut cleverli prostitut altogeth instead exploit prostitut form sexual exploit leav term interpret domest legal system
TEXT:  It is unsurprising that the bid to define all prostitution as forced failed during the Vienna Process.

TEXT:  Following this logic, the same claim could be made about all migrants who make great sacrifices to escape dire conditions, working at dangerous or menial jobs because they have no better option. By defining all prostitution as trafficking, the line between “smuggling” and “trafficking” would have become irreversibly blurred., LINE: 1645, BOOK: Migration Crises and the Struct, KEYWORD: follow logic claim could made migrant make great sacrific escap dire condit work danger menial job better option prostitut line smuggl would becom irrevers blur
TEXT:  As it stands, “trafficked” migrants are victims while “smuggled” migrants have agency. While the Smuggling Protocol intentionally stops short of criminalizing smuggled migrants, it does not identify them as victims in need of special protection (International Council on Human Rights Policy 2010)., LINE: 1646, BOOK: Migration Crises and the Struct, KEYWORD: stand migrant victim migrant agenc smuggl protocol intent stop short migrant doe identifi victim need special protect intern council human right polici

TEXT:  This interest was strong enough for the US administration to resist significant pressure from domestic groups advocating a more expansive definition of trafficking.

TEXT:  Despite this public controversy, there was a broad consensus that trafficking produces victims to whom the state has some obligation and that traffickers are criminals who should be prosecuted.

TEXT:  Migrants sometimes start off as smuggled, but once they are in the destination country, they may be forced to work to pay off their smuggling debts. In both trafficking and smuggling, there can be elements of free choice and coercion, despite the fact that coercion is supposed to be one of the legally defining differences between the two (Bouteillet-Paquet 2011)., LINE: 1655, BOOK: Migration Crises and the Struct, KEYWORD: migrant sometim start destin countri may forc work pay smuggl debt smuggl element free choic coercion despit fact coercion suppos one legal differ two paquet
TEXT:  Furthermore, migrant rights advocates would argue that smuggled migrants are “coerced” to emigrate by poverty, oppression, insecurity, and a host of other problems. If the level of victimization determines the degree of obligation that a state has to migrants, then recipient states will want to narrow the definition of a victim while sending states will want to expand it., LINE: 1656, BOOK: Migration Crises and the Struct, KEYWORD: furthermor migrant right advoc would argu migrant emigr poverti oppress insecur host problem level victim degre oblig state ha migrant recipi state want narrow definit victim send state want expand
TEXT:  In the end, the Smuggling Protocol represented a compromise on these two issues rather than a consensus.

TEXT:  First, informality avoids unnecessary sacrifices of national sovereignty. Binding agreements limit the policy choices that states may make in the future; while states can break binding agreements, the diplomatic costs or punishments inflicted by built-in enforcement mechanisms are likely to be higher than in nonbinding arrangements (Cassarino 2007)., LINE: 1698, BOOK: Migration Crises and the Struct, KEYWORD: first inform unnecessari sacrific nation sovereignti bind agreement limit polici choic state may make futur state break bind agreement diplomat cost punish built enforc mechan like higher arrang
TEXT:  States may also have a desire to avoid formal or visible pledges to other states, which could have reputational or precedent-setting effects (Lipson 1991). The United States, for example, might want to work with Mexico on migration issues, but it would be hesitant to create a highly visible agreement that other states in Central and South America could use as a model to pressure it into similar agreements., LINE: 1699, BOOK: Migration Crises and the Struct, KEYWORD: state may also desir avoid formal visibl pledg state could preced set effect unit state exampl might want work migrat issu would hesit creat highli visibl agreement state central south could use model pressur similar agreement
TEXT:  Informal processes lower these stakes and give each country an exit option at any point.

TEXT:  Informality allows states the flexibility to deal with changing circumstances and makes them more willing to engage now with less concern about future ramifications. Informal arrangements can be renegotiated more quickly than binding agreements., LINE: 1703, BOOK: Migration Crises and the Struct, KEYWORD: inform state flexibl deal circumst make will engag less concern futur ramif inform arrang quickli bind agreement
TEXT:  Third, informality allows states to avoid protracted, and perhaps unwinnable, domestic battles (Lipson 1991).

TEXT:  While any formal international agreement might provoke opposition from those who oppose conceding any national sovereignty to international institutions, public opinion on migration issues in particular is very divided, making it politically difficult to ratify international agreements (Cassarino 2007)., LINE: 1705, BOOK: Migration Crises and the Struct, KEYWORD: formal intern agreement might provok opposit oppos nation sovereignti intern institut public opinion migrat issu particular divid make polit difficult ratifi intern agreement
TEXT:  Receiving countries face competing political pressure from anti-immigrant groups and business interests in need of a labor source (Sölner 1999). The controversy over how to address immigration issues in receiving countries has been an obstacle even to unilateral, national legislation; the US Senate’s rejection of comprehensive immigration reform in 2007 highlights the political challenge of managing immigration (Weisman 2007)., LINE: 1706, BOOK: Migration Crises and the Struct, KEYWORD: countri face polit pressur anti immigr group busi interest need labor sourc controversi address immigr issu countri ha obstacl even unilater nation legisl senat reject comprehens immigr reform highlight polit challeng immigr

TEXT:  Informality allows states to largely circumvent both the legislative process and public scrutiny. Because informal processes are nonbinding, the national bureaucracies can begin working directly with their counterparts in other states without going through a ratification process., LINE: 1708, BOOK: Migration Crises and the Struct, KEYWORD: inform state larg circumv legisl process public scrutini inform process nation bureaucraci begin work directli counterpart state without go ratif process
TEXT:  Informal processes simply allow bureaucracies to implement national policies in a more effective, efficient way.

TEXT:  At the same time, informality keeps policymaking in the hands of the executive and the bureaucracy, away from legislative influence. In the domestic struggle for political power, informal processes are thus favored by the executive and the agencies in charge of implementing policy (Benvenisti 2006)., LINE: 1710, BOOK: Migration Crises and the Struct, KEYWORD: time inform keep hand execut bureaucraci away legisl influenc domest struggl polit power inform process thu favor execut agenc charg polici

TEXT:  Formal, binding cooperation is more likely to create standing organizations with their own bureaucratic employees who may come to develop independent expertise and independent influence over policy (Barnett and Finnemore 1999; Nielson and Tierney 2003; Pollack 1997)., LINE: 1712, BOOK: Migration Crises and the Struct, KEYWORD: formal bind like creat stand organ bureaucrat employe may come develop independ independ influenc polici pollack
TEXT:  In contrast, informality allows states’ bureaucracies to maintain their dominance over information and expertise in their policy arena.

TEXT:  RCPs themselves do not represent “cooperation,” informal or otherwise. Instead, they are a venue for facilitating cooperation.

TEXT:  Sometimes, these are high-level meetings that focus on developing policy goals, but the RCPs can also facilitate communication between lower-level officials in charge of implementing policy. The informality of the RCPs, along with their confidentiality, allows states to raise nearly any issue related to migration., LINE: 1715, BOOK: Migration Crises and the Struct, KEYWORD: sometim high level meet focu polici goal also facilit commun lower level offici charg polici inform along confidenti state rais nearli issu relat migrat
TEXT:  Whether or not this communication will result in cooperation is dependent on state interests. In most cases, states do not share interests. Even when there are no shared interests, states may gather information through the RCPs that could allow them to make offers of side payments that are attractive enough to induce cooperation (chapter 3 addresses this type of cooperation in depth)., LINE: 1716, BOOK: Migration Crises and the Struct, KEYWORD: whether commun result depend state interest case state share interest even interest state may gather inform could allow make offer side payment attract enough induc chapter address type depth

TEXT:  RCP documents often lack concrete plans of action and frequently address the same issues, year after year. The following excerpt from the Chair’s Summary of the Joint Conference of UNODC and the Budapest Process with the Organization of the Black Sea Economic Cooperation on “Trafficking in Human Beings in the Black Sea Region” in 2007 demonstrates this lack of action: “Regional cooperation in the field of data collection shall be strengthened., LINE: 1718, BOOK: Migration Crises and the Struct, KEYWORD: document often lack concret plan action frequent address issu year year follow excerpt chair summari joint confer process organ black sea econom human black sea region lack action region field data collect shall
TEXT:  To facilitate this process, cooperation and coordination of the information flow between different actors along the trafficking chain is needed.

TEXT:  While trafficking represents an area of shared interest, the manner in which it was addressed at this meeting was shaped by the informality of the RCP.

TEXT:  “Data collection shall be strengthened,” but who shall strengthen it? “Cooperation and coordination” may be “needed,” but who will cooperate and coordinate? The RCPs are designed to be safe, open forums for state delegates to freely discuss any migration-related issue, and the range of topics covered in RCP reports reflects this intention., LINE: 1721, BOOK: Migration Crises and the Struct, KEYWORD: data collect shall shall strengthen may design safe open forum state deleg freeli discu migrat relat issu rang topic cover report intent
TEXT:  By design, the RCPs’ primary accomplishments are creating opportunities for state representatives to meet (at conferences and seminars) and producing reports on the topics covered.

TEXT:  There are, however, a few instances of RCPs producing more tangible outcomes. What explains whether an issue within an RCP gets relegated to an endless cycle of meetings and reports or provokes concrete action? First, in all cases that produce tangible outcomes, states must share a particular interest, although the interest may be of varying importance for different states., LINE: 1723, BOOK: Migration Crises and the Struct, KEYWORD: howev instanc tangibl outcom whether issu within get endless cycl meet report concret action first case produc tangibl outcom state must share particular interest although interest may import differ state

At minimum, none of the states can have an actively opposing interest in the given issue., LINE: 1724, BOOK: Migration Crises and the Struct, KEYWORD: word state must prefer chang statu quo win set polici space prefer state statu quo cannot empti minimum none state activ oppos interest given issu
TEXT:  The informal character of RCPs means that there is no mechanism to coerce or mandate compliance with any agreement made within the context of the RCP, so a shared interest (or absence of a conflict of interest) is essential., LINE: 1725, BOOK: Migration Crises and the Struct, KEYWORD: inform charact mean mechan coerc mandat complianc agreement made within context interest absenc conflict interest essenti
TEXT:  Second, some state (or group of states) must assume the financial and logistical costs of concrete action.

TEXT:  In the following section, we examine the action plans of the Regional Conference on Migration to support this argument.

TEXT:  The meeting was organized and hosted by the Mexican government, with technical and administrative support coming from the IOM. At the meeting, the participating countries created a basic framework for ongoing interaction, establishing an annual high-level meeting of vice-ministers (with both open and closed sessions) and creating the Regional Consultation Group on Migration, which includes state representatives from the technical and operational levels of government and observer organizations and meets annually, before the ministerial meetings., LINE: 1732, BOOK: Migration Crises and the Struct, KEYWORD: meet wa organ govern technic administr support come meet countri basic framework ongo interact annual high level meet vice minist open close session region consult group migrat state repres technic oper level govern observ organ meet annual ministeri meet

TEXT:  By 2002, the RCM had succeeded in drafting a plan of action to guide its activities.

TEXT:  The RCM shifted focus from the interests of sending states (the development of economic opportunities at home and the protection of migrant rights) to those of receiving states (migration control). The action plan presented three issue areas for the RCM, with objectives in each category: Migration Policies and Management (twelve objectives), Human Rights (five), and the Link between Development and Migration (seven) (RCM 2009a, 2009b)., LINE: 1735, BOOK: Migration Crises and the Struct, KEYWORD: focu interest send state develop econom opportun home protect migrant right state migrat control action plan three issu area object categori migrat polici manag twelv object human right five link develop migrat seven

TEXT:  Of the combined twelve objectives under Human Rights and the Link between Development and Migration, only two have been addressed with such actions (one under each category).

TEXT:  Half of the objectives in the RCM’s action plan focus on human rights and development, but these issues are much less likely to be addressed with concrete action.

TEXT:  Poorer, sending states still participate in the process since none of the objectives contradict their interests, but the RCPs fail to deliver on priorities most important to sending states.

TEXT:  BILATERAL COOPERATION Although we know that bilateral cooperation exists, it is virtually impossible to collate all bilateral agreements on trafficking and smuggling as there is no single repository of bilateral agreements and states are not required to submit these agreements to a repository., LINE: 1756, BOOK: Migration Crises and the Struct, KEYWORD: bilater although know bilater virtual imposs collat bilater agreement smuggl singl repositori bilater agreement state submit agreement repositori
TEXT:  We do know that states have pursued, and continue to pursue, both formal and informal bilateral agreements.

TEXT:  Bilateral agreements tend to be memoranda of understanding rather than memoranda of agreement, meaning that they are not legally binding. Thus there are no enforcement mechanisms that require states to adhere to the “understanding,” and states may modify the terms of the memorandum unilaterally., LINE: 1765, BOOK: Migration Crises and the Struct, KEYWORD: bilater agreement tend memoranda understand rather memoranda agreement mean legal bind thu enforc mechan requir state adher understand state may modifi term memorandum unilater
TEXT:  This format underscores the informality of so many of these agreements. The bilateral agreements appear to be almost exclusively devoted to trafficking rather than smuggling.

TEXT: 12 The agreements usually incorporate three aspects of bilateral cooperation: repatriation of victims, extradition of criminals, and information sharing (Yamada 2012). However, in her analysis of Thailand’s set of bilateral agreements with its neighbors, Yamada argues that “repatriation is the raison d’être for such memoranda” (11)., LINE: 1767, BOOK: Migration Crises and the Struct, KEYWORD: agreement usual incorpor three aspect bilater repatri victim extradit crimin inform howev analysi set bilater agreement neighbor repatri memoranda
TEXT:  The focus on repatriation has been tied to patterns of trafficking flows that are similar to the generic “voluntary” migration flows described in chapter 1. As Yamada (2012, 1) notes, “In many cases of cross-border human trafficking, there are patterns and trends of human trafficking routes from one specific origin country to a specific destination country., LINE: 1768, BOOK: Migration Crises and the Struct, KEYWORD: focu repatri ha tie pattern flow similar gener voluntari migrat flow chapter note mani case cross border human pattern trend human rout one specif origin countri specif destin countri

TEXT:  Thompson and Verdier (2014) anticipate that states will choose to pursue a combination of multilateralism and bilateralism when transaction costs and member surplus are high. Human trafficking and smuggling might provide an example of such a scenario, explaining the dual approach that states have taken., LINE: 1770, BOOK: Migration Crises and the Struct, KEYWORD: anticip state choos pursu combin bilater transact cost member surplu high human smuggl might provid exampl scenario explain dual approach state taken

TEXT:  Doing this multilaterally was feasible and reduced transaction costs in that the basic framework did not need to be renegotiated with each state. But as with all migration flows, patterns of trafficking and smuggling are unique to each dyad of states and usually nonreciprocal, as are the criminal networks that facilitate these flows., LINE: 1772, BOOK: Migration Crises and the Struct, KEYWORD: multilater wa feasibl reduc transact cost basic framework need state migrat flow pattern smuggl uniqu dyad state usual nonreciproc crimin network facilit flow

TEXT:  UNILATERAL ACTION: THE TRAFFICKING VICTIMS PROTECTION ACT The United States played a key role in the drafting of the Palermo Protocols.

TEXT:  While the Clinton administration expressed a commitment to international cooperation on the global stage, the domestic legislation made a strong unilateral statement. In addition to strengthening the ability of the government to prosecute traffickers and smugglers domestically, the TVPA created new standards and a monitoring body by which the United States would judge other states’ antitrafficking efforts., LINE: 1778, BOOK: Migration Crises and the Struct, KEYWORD: administr express commit intern global stage domest legisl made strong unilater statement addit strengthen abil govern prosecut smuggler domest new standard bodi unit state would judg state effort
TEXT:  It authorized the president to apply unilateral sanctions against any state that did not meet these standards, although it did not require him to do so (Chuang 2006). While the Clinton administration argued that the TVPA and the Palermo Protocols were complementary, critics asserted that TVPA undermined the emerging international regime and questioned the authority of the United States to stand in judgment of other states’ actions., LINE: 1779, BOOK: Migration Crises and the Struct, KEYWORD: author presid appli unilater sanction state meet standard although requir administr protocol complementari critic intern regim author unit state stand judgment state action

TEXT:  Free from concerns about relinquishing sovereignty, making long-term commitments in a volatile international environment, or reaching consensus with other states, the United States was able to enact much stronger policies in the TVPA than were possible in the Palermo Protocols., LINE: 1781, BOOK: Migration Crises and the Struct, KEYWORD: free concern sovereignti make long term commit volatil intern environ reach consensu state unit state wa abl enact much polici possibl protocol
TEXT:  Not only was the United States able to enshrine, in domestic law, policies that other countries would have opposed, it was also able to pursue policies that it would have opposed if included in an international agreement!

TEXT:  Most significantly, the Palermo Protocols and the TVPA approach trafficking and smuggling through a criminal justice lens.

TEXT:  We show how domestic interest groups were able to appeal to both Republicans and Democrats to get the TVPA passed, along with reauthorizations in 2004 and 2007. These groups, coming from both the left and the right, challenged the government’s position in the international negotiations that prostitution could be a choice and was not always a sign of coercion., LINE: 1784, BOOK: Migration Crises and the Struct, KEYWORD: show domest interest group abl appeal republican democrat get along group come left right govern posit intern negoti prostitut could choic wa alway sign coercion

TEXT:  In 1998, President Clinton issued a presidential directive to federal agencies to enforce laws applicable to trafficking and to assist victims. The directive also gave the President’s Interagency Council on Women (PICW) the task of leading further efforts to address trafficking (Gulati 2012; Miko 2004; Masci 2004)., LINE: 1790, BOOK: Migration Crises and the Struct, KEYWORD: presid presidenti direct feder agenc enforc law applic assist victim direct also gave presid interag council woman task lead effort address

TEXT:  While the Clinton administration worked to advance antitrafficking efforts at the global level, the Republican-led Congress took the lead in drafting domestic legislation (Chuang 2006).

TEXT:  The final bill, titled the Trafficking Victims Protection Act, received nearly unanimous support in both chambers; the Senate voted 95 to 0, the House 371 to 1.

TEXT:  Two features of the TVPA stand out. First, the strong bipartisan support of the TVPA belies the fact that it reflected clear Republican priorities; the end result would likely have looked much different if Democrats had been in the majority., LINE: 1796, BOOK: Migration Crises and the Struct, KEYWORD: two featur stand first strong bipartisan support fact reflect clear republican prioriti end result would like much differ democrat major
TEXT:  Second, the bill went much further and offered more protections to trafficking victims than any international effort, demonstrating a willingness by both parties to implement policies at the national level to which the state would be unwilling to commit at the international level., LINE: 1797, BOOK: Migration Crises and the Struct, KEYWORD: second bill went much protect victim intern effort willing parti implement polici nation level state would unwil commit intern level
TEXT:  The TVPA reflected Republican priorities through three key elements: its unilateralism, its specific focus on sex trafficking, and its minimization of labor issues. First, the bill created a new, unilateral sanctions regime to punish states that did not comply with minimum US standards to combat trafficking., LINE: 1798, BOOK: Migration Crises and the Struct, KEYWORD: reflect republican prioriti three key element unilater specif focu sex minim labor issu first bill new unilater sanction regim punish state compli minimum standard combat
TEXT:  Under the regime, the US government could deny non-humanitarian, non-trade-related foreign assistance to any country that did not make significant efforts to comply with these standards.13 The bill tasked the Department of State with conducting annual assessments of any country with more a hundred trafficked individuals and issuing its findings in an annual Trafficking in Persons Report (Chuang 2006)., LINE: 1799, BOOK: Migration Crises and the Struct, KEYWORD: regim govern could deni non humanitarian non trade relat foreign assist countri make signific effort compli standard bill depart state annual assess countri hundr individu issu find annual person report
TEXT:  The Clinton administration strongly opposed the unilateral sanctions provision of the TVPA, believing that it would be both ineffective and “profoundly counterproductive” (Chuang 2006).

TEXT:  The fact that Congress quickly passed the more comprehensive TVPA in 2000 while not ratifying the Palermo Protocols until 2005 indicates the reluctance of the Republican-led Congress to make multilateral commitments, not a reluctance to address the problem of trafficking., LINE: 1801, BOOK: Migration Crises and the Struct, KEYWORD: fact congress quickli comprehens protocol reluct republican led congress make multilater commit reluct address problem
TEXT:  Second, it would incentivize states to hide the seriousness of their trafficking problems in order to avoid sanctions. Third, it would cause governments to view the antitrafficking efforts of both international and local NGOs as a threat, since their attempts to raise awareness about the problem of trafficking might expose the state to sanctions., LINE: 1802, BOOK: Migration Crises and the Struct, KEYWORD: second would state hide serious problem order avoid sanction third would caus govern view effort intern local threat sinc attempt rais awar problem might expos state sanction
TEXT:  Fourth, the entire introduction of a new sanctions regime contradicted the administration’s new policy of limiting the use of sanctions, in light of the fact that sanctions had been used with increasing frequency and decreasing success in recent years (Chuang 2006)., LINE: 1803, BOOK: Migration Crises and the Struct, KEYWORD: fourth entir introduct new sanction regim administr new polici limit use sanction light fact sanction use increas frequenc decreas success recent year
TEXT:  If the Democrats had been in charge, a unilateral sanctions regime would likely not have been part of the final bill.

TEXT: ” The same controversy around “forced” versus “voluntary” prostitution that dominated the debate during the Vienna Process also arose during the congressional debate. This time, however, the antiprostitution side succeeded in defining sex trafficking as “the recruitment, harboring, transportation, provision, or obtaining of a person for the purpose of a commercial sex act., LINE: 1805, BOOK: Migration Crises and the Struct, KEYWORD: controversi around forc versu voluntari prostitut domin debat process also aros congression debat time howev side sex recruit transport provis person purpos commerci sex act
TEXT: ” Unlike the definition in the Palermo Protocol, the TVPA thus included consensual prostitution as a form of trafficking, reflecting the influence of the evangelical Christian activist groups who lobbied Republicans that prostitution could never be consensual., LINE: 1806, BOOK: Migration Crises and the Struct, KEYWORD: unlik definit protocol thu includ consensu prostitut form reflect influenc evangel activist group republican prostitut could never consensu
TEXT:  While the TVPA was more inclusive in defining victims of sex trafficking, it was less inclusive in including victims trafficked for other types of labor.

TEXT:  While the Department of State acknowledges that the line between smuggling and trafficking can be hard to define, such as when migrants believe they are being smuggled and then end up trafficked, the TVPA provides services and programs only for trafficked victims, not smuggled individuals (US Department of State 2006)., LINE: 1808, BOOK: Migration Crises and the Struct, KEYWORD: depart state line smuggl hard defin migrant believ end servic program victim individu depart state

TEXT:  Antitrafficking legislation was first introduced in the House of Representatives by Chris Smith, a Republican from New Jersey, along with Marcy Kaptur, a Democrat from Ohio, in 1999 (HR 1356: “The Freedom from Sexual Trafficking Act of 1999”)., LINE: 1812, BOOK: Migration Crises and the Struct, KEYWORD: legisl wa first hous repres smith republican new jersey along democrat freedom sexual act
TEXT:  Representative Sam Gejdenson, a Connecticut Democrat, introduced competing legislation that same year (HR 3154: “The Comprehensive Anti-Trafficking in Persons Act of 1999”).

Both bills addressed both sex trafficking and involuntary servitude through coercion, fraud, force, or deception., LINE: 1815, BOOK: Migration Crises and the Struct, KEYWORD: senat sam brownback republican democrat legisl wa similar bill sex involuntari servitud coercion fraud forc decept
TEXT:  They differed, however, in their enforcement mechanism; Brownback’s bill called for unilateral sanctions, while Wellstone’s did not. Wellstone’s bill thus reflected the Clinton administration’s preference to limit the use of unilateral sanctions., LINE: 1816, BOOK: Migration Crises and the Struct, KEYWORD: howev enforc mechan brownback bill unilater sanction bill thu reflect administr prefer limit use unilater sanction
TEXT:  Brownback’s interest in trafficking stemmed from his earlier work on slavery in Sudan, and he was influenced by a coalition of evangelical Christian and human rights groups that had worked closely with him on drafting earlier legislation related to religious freedom (Stolz 2005)., LINE: 1817, BOOK: Migration Crises and the Struct, KEYWORD: brownback interest stem work slaveri wa coalit evangel human right group work close draft legisl relat religi freedom
TEXT:  This may explain why his bill, unlike that of his Republican counterpart in the House, paid greater attention to other types of labor trafficking.

TEXT:  In comparison to the international negotiations, however, there were few American groups that advocated for a distinction between types of prostitution. Instead, Christian organizations, human rights groups, and mainstream feminist groups and individuals, including the National Organization of Women and Gloria Steinem, argued that all forms of prostitution should be considered coerced (Stolz 2005)., LINE: 1819, BOOK: Migration Crises and the Struct, KEYWORD: comparison intern negoti howev group distinct type prostitut instead organ human right group feminist group individu nation organ woman form prostitut consid

TEXT:  Despite the even greater consensus in the United States than in the international community, across a broad range of ideologically diverse interest groups, that prostitution should not be distinguished from forced prostitution, the final version of the TVPA adopted the distinction, at least in terms of the actual enforcement of the law’s provisions., LINE: 1821, BOOK: Migration Crises and the Struct, KEYWORD: despit even greater consensu unit state intern commun across broad rang ideolog divers interest group prostitut distinguish forc prostitut final version adopt distinct least term actual enforc law provis
TEXT: 14 Legislators from both parties, along with the White House and the PICW, all made it clear that they opposed the legalization of prostitution (Shenon 2000).

TEXT:  Thus, the TVPA remained a law focused on criminal justice, human rights, and (to a lesser extent) labor rights, but lawmakers were careful to not stray too far into the realm of immigration policy, a much more contentious and divisive policy arena., LINE: 1824, BOOK: Migration Crises and the Struct, KEYWORD: thu law crimin justic human right lesser extent labor right lawmak care stray far realm immigr polici much contenti divis polici arena

TEXT:  The TVPA allowed for the possibility of either temporary or even permanent residency for victims of trafficking, provided that the victims assist in the prosecution of their traffickers. It authorized up to five thousand special “T-Visas” per year to be allocated to trafficking victims (US Department of Health and Human Services 2003)., LINE: 1826, BOOK: Migration Crises and the Struct, KEYWORD: possibl either temporari even perman resid victim provid victim assist prosecut author five thousand special visa per year victim depart health human servic
TEXT:  The law also made public assistance available to victims and some family members, and it provided them with the ability to sue their victimizers. Within the first few years after the TVPA was signed into law, eighteen to twenty thousand trafficking victims were being assisted in some way (US Department of Health and Human Services 2003)., LINE: 1827, BOOK: Migration Crises and the Struct, KEYWORD: law also made public assist avail victim famili member provid abil sue victim within first year wa law eighteen twenti thousand victim way depart health human servic
TEXT:  Additionally, the TVPA established programs to strengthen capacity in sending countries, to provide economic alternatives to potential targets of traffickers in their home countries, and to raise public awareness in sending countries about the dangers of trafficking (Chuang 2006)., LINE: 1828, BOOK: Migration Crises and the Struct, KEYWORD: addit establish program strengthen capac send countri provid econom altern potenti target home countri rais public awar send countri danger
TEXT:  Although these types of concrete provisions and commitments were feasible at the domestic, unilateral level, the United States would never have committed to them in the Palermo Protocols. ALTERNATIVE EXPLANATIONS Another useful approach to understanding the development of international cooperation on trafficking and smuggling, and particularly why some efforts took hold and succeeded while others did not, comes from the literature on policy diffusion., LINE: 1829, BOOK: Migration Crises and the Struct, KEYWORD: although type concret provis commit feasibl domest unilater level unit state would never protocol altern explan anoth use approach understand develop intern smuggl particularli effort took hold come literatur polici diffus
TEXT:  Policy diffusion describes a broader phenomenon than cooperation or coordination, but it encompasses these processes as well. Common policy can emerge through simultaneous (or sequential) independent policy adoption by individual states., LINE: 1830, BOOK: Migration Crises and the Struct, KEYWORD: polici diffus phenomenon process well common polici emerg simultan sequenti independ polici adopt individu state
TEXT:  It can also emerge through coordination or cooperation by state actors. Thus, insights on policy diffusion are directly applicable to international cooperation and coordination. Simmons, Dobbin, and Garrett (2006) identify four mechanisms by which policy diffuses: coercion, competition, learning, and emulation., LINE: 1831, BOOK: Migration Crises and the Struct, KEYWORD: also emerg state actor thu insight polici diffus directli applic intern dobbin identifi four mechan polici coercion competit learn emul
TEXT:  Coercion and competition reflect material concerns (Lloyd, Simmons, and Stewart 2012). Coercion occurs when powerful states manipulate less powerful states to adopt policies or sign onto cooperative agreements by offering incentives to those that comply and by threatening punishments to those who do not., LINE: 1832, BOOK: Migration Crises and the Struct, KEYWORD: coercion competit reflect materi concern coercion power state manipul less power state adopt polici sign onto agreement offer incent compli threaten punish
TEXT:  “Soft” coercion is more difficult to identify, but it can also play a key role in policy diffusion. Powerful states often have the ability to be policy leaders and “go it alone.” By acting unilaterally, they create a focal point for coordinating policy, and other states follow their lead (Simmons, Dobbin, and Garrett 2006)., LINE: 1833, BOOK: Migration Crises and the Struct, KEYWORD: soft coercion difficult identifi also play key role polici diffus power state often abil polici leader alon act unilater creat focal point polici state follow lead dobbin
TEXT:  Soft coercion can also occur through ideological hegemony. Because powerful states play a central role in policy networks and international organizations, they have a significant influence in framing debates (Simmons, Dobbin, and Garrett 2006; Lloyd and Simmons 2012)., LINE: 1834, BOOK: Migration Crises and the Struct, KEYWORD: soft coercion also occur ideolog hegemoni power state play central role polici network intern organ signific influenc frame debat dobbin
TEXT:  Powerful states can influence which problems rise to the top of the international agenda, what types of outcomes are most desirable, and which means will best lead to these outcomes. Competition is another material explanation of policy diffusion., LINE: 1835, BOOK: Migration Crises and the Struct, KEYWORD: power state influenc problem rise top intern agenda type outcom desir mean best lead outcom competit anoth materi explan polici diffus
TEXT:  More decentralized than coercion, it explains policy diffusion as a market-based phenomenon. States adopt particular policies that they would otherwise not because if they do not, they will lose out on benefits that will instead go to states that do., LINE: 1836, BOOK: Migration Crises and the Struct, KEYWORD: coercion polici diffus market base phenomenon state adopt particular polici would otherwis lose benefit instead state
TEXT:  Competition is most often used to explain economic policies, particularly the trend toward greater liberalization, which is rewarded by international markets. The competition explanation differs from coercion in that states are not intentionally rewarded or punished by powerful states; instead, natural competition leads to policy diffusion without direction from particular actors., LINE: 1837, BOOK: Migration Crises and the Struct, KEYWORD: competit often use explain econom polici particularli trend toward greater liber intern market competit explan coercion state intent power state instead natur competit lead polici diffus without direct particular actor
TEXT:  Diffusion through learning bridges the gap between material explanations and explanations based on less tangible social structures and peer effects. In their simplest manifestation, learning explanations suggest that policy diffuses as states observe the behavior of other states, seeing the good results of best practices and the failure of poor policies., LINE: 1838, BOOK: Migration Crises and the Struct, KEYWORD: diffus learn bridg gap materi explan explan base less tangibl social structur peer effect manifest learn explan suggest polici state observ behavior state see good result best practic failur poor polici
TEXT:  Through information sharing in policy networks, states gravitate toward common policies that are objectively more productive and efficient; no coercion or outside incentive is needed. In a more complex manifestation, learning is not a completely rational process in which states come to commonly identify an objectively “best policy., LINE: 1839, BOOK: Migration Crises and the Struct, KEYWORD: inform polici network state gravit toward common polici object product effici coercion outsid incent complex manifest learn complet ration process state come commonli identifi object best polici
TEXT: ” Instead, learning is rational only in a bounded sense, since available information is always limited. Power dynamics may influence which policies are even considered, as powerful states have significant influence over what policymakers learn and what information is available to them., LINE: 1840, BOOK: Migration Crises and the Struct, KEYWORD: instead learn ration bound sens sinc avail inform alway limit power dynam may influenc polici even consid power state signific influenc learn inform avail
TEXT:  On the far end of the spectrum, the “emulation” explanation sees policy diffusion stemming not from material structures and effects at all but rather from less tangible social structures and peer effects (Lloyd, Simmons, and Stewart 2012)., LINE: 1841, BOOK: Migration Crises and the Struct, KEYWORD: far end spectrum emul explan see polici diffus stem materi structur effect rather less tangibl social structur peer effect
TEXT:  Unlike the simple learning explanation, the emulation explanation does not rely on the idea of a “best policy” diffusing at all. Instead, it explains the consensus that emerges around “best practices,” and their subsequent diffusion, as a socially constructed process that occurs through emulation over time., LINE: 1842, BOOK: Migration Crises and the Struct, KEYWORD: unlik simpl learn explan emul explan doe reli idea best polici instead consensu around best practic subsequ diffus social process emul time
TEXT:  Policy dispersion can spread from developed states to developing states, not because of coercion by developed states, or even because these policies are objectively the “best,” but because developing states aspire to become developed states., LINE: 1843, BOOK: Migration Crises and the Struct, KEYWORD: polici dispers spread state state coercion state even polici object best state aspir becom state
TEXT:  Similarly, policy can also diffuse through peer states, as states look for solutions to policy problems within states that they perceive to be similar. The mechanism of policy diffusion is not easy to discern for a particular issue area., LINE: 1844, BOOK: Migration Crises and the Struct, KEYWORD: similarli polici also diffus peer state state look solut polici problem within state perceiv similar mechan polici diffus easi discern particular issu area
TEXT:  There could be multiple mechanisms at work, and some of these mechanisms may appear observationally equivalent. In particular, it can be difficult to determine whether states are adopting common policies because they freely seek to emulate other states or because powerful states have coerced them into adopting similar policies., LINE: 1845, BOOK: Migration Crises and the Struct, KEYWORD: could multipl mechan work mechan may appear observ equival particular difficult determin whether state common polici freeli seek emul state power state similar polici

TEXT:  In two separate articles, Lloyd and her coauthors argue that the cooperative agreements and common policies that have emerged to address human trafficking in the past fifteen years are due to a combination of diffusion mechanisms that include both material and ideational factors (Lloyd, Simmons, and Stewart 2012; Lloyd and Simmons 2012)., LINE: 1847, BOOK: Migration Crises and the Struct, KEYWORD: two separ articl coauthor argu agreement common polici address human past fifteen year due combin diffus mechan includ materi ideat factor
TEXT:  These diffusion mechanisms affect both states’ adoption of domestic antitrafficking laws and participation in international agreements. They provide evidence that these policies are a response to both material interests and a global discourse linking trafficking to broader criminal activity., LINE: 1848, BOOK: Migration Crises and the Struct, KEYWORD: diffus mechan affect state adopt domest law particip intern agreement provid evid polici respons materi interest global discours link crimin activ
TEXT:  Controlling for material interests, increased media coverage linking trafficking as a criminal activity with a particular country makes it more likely that the country will adopt antitrafficking policies (Lloyd, Simmons, and Stewart 2012)., LINE: 1849, BOOK: Migration Crises and the Struct, KEYWORD: materi interest medium coverag link crimin activ particular countri make like countri adopt polici
TEXT:  These findings within the policy diffusion literature are not contradictory to our own argument, but there are some key distinctions.

TEXT:  States have different resources, different problems, and different priorities. In the case of trafficking and smuggling, the most obvious difference between states is that some produce trafficked and smuggled migrants and some receive them., LINE: 1851, BOOK: Migration Crises and the Struct, KEYWORD: state differ resourc differ problem differ prioriti case smuggl obviou differ state produc migrant receiv
TEXT:  Thus, we do not assume that there is some objective “best practice” policy that states will learn of or emulate. What is good for one state may not be good for another. Following from this, we place a much stronger emphasis on material interests and structure, particularly power dynamics and the coercive abilities of strong states, not simply “natural” competition between states to adopt efficient policy., LINE: 1852, BOOK: Migration Crises and the Struct, KEYWORD: thu assum object best practic polici state learn emul good one state may good anoth follow place much emphasi materi interest structur particularli power dynam coerciv abil strong state simpli natur competit state adopt effici polici

TEXT:  Committing to a binding international agreement, in particular, is something states are generally reluctant do, since it necessarily weakens their sovereignty and independence.

TEXT:  We expect that ideational factors would play a larger role in the domestic policymaking environment than in international agreements, although material interests should remain dominant.

TEXT:  The diffusion literature also fails to address the timing, shape, and specific content of the international cooperation that ensued.

TEXT:  The Palermo Protocols were not the first effort to address the issue. Our focus on the status quo ante and state preferences, as well as exogenous shocks to the status quo, allows us to trace the initiation of efforts to renegotiate existing multilateral trafficking agreements., LINE: 1857, BOOK: Migration Crises and the Struct, KEYWORD: protocol first effort address issu focu statu quo ant state prefer well exogen shock statu quo trace initi effort renegoti multilater agreement
TEXT:  We also explain why the multilateral agreement was supplemented by bilateral agreements, reflecting the specific trafficking patterns that receiving states experience.

TEXT:  Finally, many domestic actors and international actors privileged victim protection in the trafficking debate but were unsuccessful in obtaining international cooperation on this issue—the Palermo Protocols are addendums to the Convention Against Transnational Organized Crime, not to the International Convention on the Protection of the Rights of All Migrant Workers and Members of Their Families., LINE: 1859, BOOK: Migration Crises and the Struct, KEYWORD: final mani domest actor intern actor privileg victim protect debat unsuccess intern issu protocol addendum convent transnat organ crime intern convent protect right migrant worker member famili

TEXT:  CONCLUSIONS Criminality in migration, manifested through trafficking and smuggling, is a problem that sending, transit, and receiving states all have an interest in eliminating. Because the crime is transnational in nature, there is an incentive for states to cooperate (or coordinate) their efforts to address the problem., LINE: 1861, BOOK: Migration Crises and the Struct, KEYWORD: conclus crimin migrat manifest smuggl problem send transit state interest crime transnat natur incent state effort address problem
TEXT:  By working together, states are likely to be more effective and efficient than they would be on their own, and both receiving states and sending states may be motivated to begin bargaining with each other., LINE: 1862, BOOK: Migration Crises and the Struct, KEYWORD: work togeth state like effect effici would state send state may begin
TEXT:  First, receiving states have been motivated to cooperate by increasing flows of trafficked and smuggled migrants, facilitated by increasingly transnational criminal networks. Second, sending states have responded to receiving states with concern about the root causes of trafficking and smuggling, and the welfare of their own citizens abroad., LINE: 1863, BOOK: Migration Crises and the Struct, KEYWORD: first state increas flow migrant increasingli transnat crimin network second send state state concern root caus smuggl welfar citizen abroad
TEXT:  Beyond the shared concern that trafficking and smuggling challenge the authority of the state, different states have different ideas about how to best address the problem, largely based on their roles as sending or receiving states., LINE: 1864, BOOK: Migration Crises and the Struct, KEYWORD: beyond concern smuggl challeng author state differ state differ idea best address problem larg base role send state
TEXT:  Sending states would like to focus antitrafficking efforts on providing economic opportunities to potential trafficking or smuggling victims, along with easier routes to legal immigration.

TEXT:  These features of the trafficking and smuggling problem lead to several outcomes. First, formal, multilateral cooperative agreements are going to be limited both in their scope and enforcement mechanisms., LINE: 1866, BOOK: Migration Crises and the Struct, KEYWORD: featur smuggl problem lead sever outcom first formal multilater agreement go limit scope enforc mechan
TEXT:  Since the area in which there is the broadest consensus is the recognition that trafficking and smuggling present a criminal challenge to the authority of the state, formal, multilateral agreements are limited to the policy realm of transnational crime., LINE: 1867, BOOK: Migration Crises and the Struct, KEYWORD: sinc area consensu recognit smuggl present crimin challeng author state formal multilater agreement limit polici realm transnat crime
TEXT:  This is reinforced by the fact that powerful receiving states are primarily concerned with the criminality aspect of trafficking and eliminating unwanted migration flows. Second, informal cooperative forums allow states to broaden cooperation to include discussions of policy solutions that may not appeal to all states equally (or not at all)., LINE: 1868, BOOK: Migration Crises and the Struct, KEYWORD: fact power state primarili concern crimin aspect unwant migrat flow second inform forum allow state broaden includ discuss polici solut may appeal state equal

TEXT:  The institutional structures of informal processes provide all states an equal voice in setting the agenda and bringing topics to the table for discussion, which provides traditionally less powerful sending states with a forum to address their concerns., LINE: 1870, BOOK: Migration Crises and the Struct, KEYWORD: institut structur inform process provid state equal voic set agenda topic tabl discuss tradit less power send state forum address concern

TEXT:  Third, states will continue to pursue unilateral action to address trafficking and smuggling, since the problem can be addressed unilaterally as well as cooperatively. This allows states to both respond to domestic interests without concern for entangling or long-term international commitments and pursue policy solutions to which other states would not agree., LINE: 1872, BOOK: Migration Crises and the Struct, KEYWORD: third state continu pursu unilater action address smuggl sinc problem unilater well state respond domest interest without concern entangl long term intern commit pursu polici solut state would agre
TEXT:  These three points lead us to a broader conclusion about the state of cooperation on migration-related criminality that is consistent with our observations in the rest of this book.

TEXT: ” The underlying legal principle arises from the idea that “territorial sovereignty … involves the exclusive right to display the activities of a State.

TEXT:  The international minimum standards for treatment of aliens were not clearly defined but developed in international case law to include “the right to life and respect for physical integrity, the right to recognition as a person before the law, freedom of conscience, prohibition of arbitrary detention, the right to a fair trial in civil and criminal matters, and the right to property” (Chetail 2014, 64)., LINE: 1926, BOOK: Migration Crises and the Struct, KEYWORD: intern minimum standard treatment alien clearli defin intern case law includ right life respect physic integr right recognit person law freedom conscienc prohibit arbitrari detent right fair trial civil crimin matter right properti
TEXT:  These rights are generally viewed as civil rights, and states were gradually adopting these civil rights for their citizens and, hence, for aliens on their territory. Nonetheless, customary international law retained the “traditional summa divisio (the principal division) based on the distinction between citizens and non-citizens” (65)., LINE: 1927, BOOK: Migration Crises and the Struct, KEYWORD: right gener civil right state gradual civil right citizen henc alien territori nonetheless customari intern law tradit princip divis base distinct citizen non citizen
TEXT:  Thus, the status quo at the turn of the twentieth century was national sovereignty over migrant rights with a minimum standard of protection. The Status Quo Ante after 1945. It is not until after World War II that the status quo for migrant rights changed with the advent of the human rights movement., LINE: 1928, BOOK: Migration Crises and the Struct, KEYWORD: thu statu quo turn twentieth centuri wa nation sovereignti migrant right minimum standard protect statu quo ant world war statu quo migrant right human right movement

TEXT:  Migrant rights expanded only as a by-product of the expansion of human rights. As the American Convention on Human Rights (OAS 1969, 69) puts it, “the essential rights of man are not derived from one’s being a national of a certain state, but are based on the attributes of the human personality., LINE: 1930, BOOK: Migration Crises and the Struct, KEYWORD: migrant right expand product expans human right convent human right put essenti right man deriv one nation certain state base attribut human person
TEXT: ” This change was initiated in the 1948 Universal Declaration of Human Rights by the United Nations. Article 2 of the declaration states that “everyone is entitled to all the rights and freedoms set forth in this Declaration, without distinction of any kind, such as race, color, sex, language, religion, political or other opinion, national or social origin, property, birth or other status” (United Nations 1948, emphasis added)., LINE: 1931, BOOK: Migration Crises and the Struct, KEYWORD: chang wa univers declar human right unit nation articl declar state everyon right freedom set forth declar without distinct kind race color sex languag religion polit opinion nation social origin properti birth statu unit nation emphasi ad

TEXT:  Article 2 of the ICCPR contains the nondiscrimination clause that prevents discrimination based on national origin using language identical to the Universal Declaration (Plender 2007, 21–22). The covenant protects the civil rights covered in the minimum international standards listed above including protection from “cruel, inhuman, or degrading treatment or punishrnent., LINE: 1933, BOOK: Migration Crises and the Struct, KEYWORD: articl claus discrimin base nation origin languag ident univers declar coven civil right cover minimum intern standard list protect cruel inhuman degrad treatment

TEXT:  Although Chetail (2014, 65) states that “human rights law asserts equality of treatment between citizens and non-citizens in accordance with the national standard,” there are some clearly demarcated distinctions between citizens and noncitizens., LINE: 1935, BOOK: Migration Crises and the Struct, KEYWORD: although state human right law equal treatment citizen non citizen accord nation standard clearli distinct citizen noncitizen

TEXT:  Moreover, there are often distinctions between the rights available to legally resident aliens and aliens without permission to reside (illegal or undocumented migrants). Chetail (2014, 70, emphasis added) concludes that, despite nondiscrimination clauses, “a differential treatment is still permissible provided that the criteria for such differentiation are ‘reasonable and objective,’ so that the exact implication for non-citizens is still difficult to grasp with certainty., LINE: 1937, BOOK: Migration Crises and the Struct, KEYWORD: moreov often distinct right avail legal resid alien alien without permiss resid illeg undocu migrant emphasi ad despit claus differenti treatment still permiss provid criterion differenti reason object exact implic non citizen still difficult grasp certainti
TEXT: ” As a result, many experts view national sovereignty rather than international law as the critical determinant of migrant rights both before and after World War II.5 Roger Böhning (1988, 133), for example, argues that “the doctrine of sovereignty considers the treatment of foreign nationals—their entry, stay, activities, and expulsion—as falling within the reserved domain of domestic jurisdiction., LINE: 1938, BOOK: Migration Crises and the Struct, KEYWORD: result mani expert view nation sovereignti rather intern law critic determin migrant right world war roger exampl doctrin sovereignti treatment foreign nation entri stay activ expuls fall within reserv domain domest jurisdict
TEXT:  In this view, every State is free to admit a foreigner or to refuse him entry and to place any limitation or condition on his stay and economic, social, political, cultural, or other activities.” Both Torpey (2000) and Salter (2003), in their assessments of the international passport regime, also consider migrant rights to be governed by national sovereignty., LINE: 1939, BOOK: Migration Crises and the Struct, KEYWORD: view everi state free admit foreign refus entri place limit condit stay econom social polit cultur activ salter assess intern passport regim also consid migrant right nation sovereignti

TEXT:  Receiving State Preferences. In contrast, migrant-receiving states do not want to be constrained by international standards regarding migrant rights.

Hence there were proposals for international legislation on working conditions during the nineteenth century, but it not until 1901 that the International Association of Labor Legislation was established, committed to propagating labor standards for all countries (Shotwell 1934; ILO 1951; Johnston 1970; ILO 2009; Rodgers et al., LINE: 1981, BOOK: Migration Crises and the Struct, KEYWORD: employ would forc limit wage benefit intern competitor henc propos intern legisl work condit nineteenth centuri intern associ labor legisl wa establish labor standard countri

TEXT:  The states party to the negotiations were the United Kingdom, the United States, Cuba, France, Belgium, Czechoslovakia, Italy, Poland, and Japan, nine states altogether (Shotwell 1934). The five “major powers,” the United Kingdom, the United States, France, Italy, and Japan, each received two votes., LINE: 1996, BOOK: Migration Crises and the Struct, KEYWORD: state parti negoti unit kingdom unit state japan nine state altogeth five major power unit kingdom unit state japan receiv two vote
TEXT:  The other countries represented at the table were chosen to represent the “minor powers” at the peace conference; of these, Belgium was allocated two votes, the remainder one each. This list is unsurprising given that these states were all part of the victorious Entente Alliance during the war; the United States was an associated power and Cuba declared war against Germany one day after the US declaration, although it did not participate in the actual conflict., LINE: 1997, BOOK: Migration Crises and the Struct, KEYWORD: countri tabl chosen repres minor power peac confer wa two vote remaind one list unsurpris given state part victori entent allianc war unit state wa associ power declar war one day declar although particip actual conflict

TEXT:  However, the remaining states were clearly or marginally sending states (Mitchell 2003). The United Kingdom was a sending state until several decades after World War II.

TEXT:  Belgium’s early industrial revolution in the south (Wallonia) drew in workers from the north (Flanders), but Flemish workers also emigrated to surrounding states.

TEXT: 13 The international status quo, as noted above, provided primarily civil protections for nationals residing in foreign countries, which suggests that sending states would petition for a more extensive set of rights to be acknowledged by receiving states., LINE: 2003, BOOK: Migration Crises and the Struct, KEYWORD: intern statu quo note provid primarili civil protect nation foreign countri send state would petit extens set right acknowledg state
TEXT:  As is the case in many international negotiations, providing the working draft is a mechanism employed to shape the outcome of the negotiations.

TEXT:  2009). This draft incorporated migrant workers in the preamble, “the protection of the interests of workers when employed in countries other than their own” (Versailles Treaty 1919). There are no minutes of the negotiations sessions, but Edward Phelan (1934) participated in the negotiations for the United States and provides a detailed description of the debate over each of the articles the UK delegation proposed., LINE: 2005, BOOK: Migration Crises and the Struct, KEYWORD: draft incorpor migrant worker preambl protect interest worker employ countri treati minut negoti session negoti unit state detail descript debat articl deleg
TEXT:  The central disputes concerned each state’s delegation to the newly founded international organization: the final agreement provides for two government representatives, one employer representative, and one worker representative, although some states sought to have an even representation and others sought to exclude government representatives altogether., LINE: 2006, BOOK: Migration Crises and the Struct, KEYWORD: central disput concern state deleg newli intern organ final agreement two govern repres one employ repres one worker repres although state sought even represent sought exclud govern repres altogeth

TEXT:  The latter position won out. There appears to have been no debate over the inclusion of workers “employed in countries other than their own.” The second component of the deliberations was the charter of workers’ rights., LINE: 2008, BOOK: Migration Crises and the Struct, KEYWORD: latter posit debat inclus worker employ countri second compon deliber wa charter worker right
TEXT:  The British delegation believed that a peace treaty was not the appropriate place for such a charter but was overruled by the other delegates. The Italian delegation made the formal proposal for the charter, and all delegations submitted petitions., LINE: 2009, BOOK: Migration Crises and the Struct, KEYWORD: deleg peac treati wa appropri place charter wa deleg deleg made formal propos charter deleg petit
TEXT:  The British, despite their initial skepticism, submitted petitions as well, to demonstrate their support, given the backing they had received during the initial negotiations. Nineteen “principles” emerged from this process; these were ordered by level of support and submitted to a two-thirds majority approval process., LINE: 2010, BOOK: Migration Crises and the Struct, KEYWORD: despit initi skeptic petit well demonstr support given back receiv initi negoti nineteen principl process order level support two third major approv process

TEXT:  Not surprisingly, the Italian delegation was active in the negotiations in an effort to include migrant workers within the remit of the newly constructed ILO. This is consistent with its position as a sending country and with its domestic legislation and national emigration agency (see above); the lead Italian delegate was Baron Mayor des Planches, the Italian commissioner-general for emigration., LINE: 2013, BOOK: Migration Crises and the Struct, KEYWORD: surprisingli deleg wa activ negoti effort includ migrant worker within remit newli consist posit send countri domest legisl nation emigr agenc see lead deleg wa baron mayor de commission gener emigr
TEXT:  The Italian delegation proposed three additional principles associated with migrant workers but was unable to marshal sufficient support for these proposals (Phelan 1934).15 Given the British hesitance toward a Charter of Worker Rights in the first place and efforts by most states to keep the list to a minimum, it is not surprising that the Italian delegation withdrew these proposals before a vote was taken., LINE: 2014, BOOK: Migration Crises and the Struct, KEYWORD: deleg three addit principl associ migrant worker wa unabl marshal suffici support propos given hesit toward charter worker right first place effort state keep list minimum surpris deleg propos vote wa taken
TEXT:  The French delegation appears to present a position at odds with its status as a receiving state. It allied with the Italian delegation to demand equal treatment for migrant workers. This can be explained in part by the personal position of members of the French delegation to the negotiations., LINE: 2015, BOOK: Migration Crises and the Struct, KEYWORD: deleg present posit odd statu state alli deleg demand equal treatment migrant worker part person posit member deleg negoti
TEXT:  The delegation included Leon Jouhaux, the head of the communist Confédération Générale du Travail. As the head of the largest French trade union, Jouhaux represented the demands of labor organizations that sought to establish standards that would prevent migrant workers in France, a receiving state, from undercutting the wages and benefits of native workers., LINE: 2016, BOOK: Migration Crises and the Struct, KEYWORD: deleg includ head communist confeder general travail head trade union demand labor organ sought establish standard would prevent migrant worker state undercut wage benefit nativ worker
TEXT:  France was also concerned about its ability to recruit sufficient immigrant labor to supplement its workforce, devastated by the war. This was a second reason for supporting equal rights for migrant workers—to facilitate the recruitment of foreign labor (Shotwell 1934)., LINE: 2017, BOOK: Migration Crises and the Struct, KEYWORD: wa also concern abil recruit suffici immigr labor supplement war wa second reason support equal right migrant worker facilit recruit foreign labor
TEXT: 16 Organizational Structure and Decision-Making Rules. The Versailles Treaty created the organizational structure of the ILO.

TEXT:  The conference legislates through conventions, recommendations, and resolutions supported by a supermajority of two-thirds of the delegates. These organizational rules are significant for two reasons., LINE: 2022, BOOK: Migration Crises and the Struct, KEYWORD: confer convent recommend resolut two third deleg organiz rule signific two reason
TEXT:  First, the tripartite representation that includes representatives of labor from both sending and receiving countries provides a forum and potential for a sending and receiving state alliance, as labor representatives generally support equal rights for migrant workers., LINE: 2023, BOOK: Migration Crises and the Struct, KEYWORD: first tripartit represent repres labor send countri forum potenti send state allianc labor repres gener support equal right migrant worker
TEXT:  That said, these organizational rules are also significant because they set the bar for the type of coalition that must come together to create a convention. A two-thirds majority is a significant hurdle to overcome, even if sending states become a numerical majority and labor representatives support migrant worker rights, given the potential opposition from employers as well as receiving states., LINE: 2024, BOOK: Migration Crises and the Struct, KEYWORD: said organiz rule also signific set bar type coalit must come togeth creat convent two third major signific hurdl overcom even send state becom numer major labor repres support migrant worker right given potenti opposit employ well state

TEXT:  Few conventions dealing with migrant workers were adopted. A list of the conventions that deal in any way with migrant workers and the number of parties to the conventions are provided in Table 7.2. All of the treaties listed, with the exception of Conventions 66, 97, and 143, establish standards for national workers but include a clause that requires states to provide reciprocity of national treatment for migrant workers., LINE: 2035, BOOK: Migration Crises and the Struct, KEYWORD: convent deal migrant worker adopt list convent deal way migrant worker number parti convent provid tabl treati list except convent establish standard nation worker includ claus state provid reciproc nation treatment migrant worker
TEXT:  Although we have listed these conventions in Table 7.2, in order to provide the most complete picture of migrant rights negotiated within the ILO, these reciprocal guarantees are of little importance as they grant national treatment only to migrants from member states that have also signed the treaty, and thus are not a straightforward grant of migrant rights., LINE: 2036, BOOK: Migration Crises and the Struct, KEYWORD: although list convent tabl order provid complet pictur migrant right within reciproc guarante littl import grant nation treatment migrant member state also treati thu straightforward grant migrant right
TEXT:  If only sending states sign these agreements, then migrants will not be covered.

TEXT:  But the few treaties addressing migrant rights were of nominal import.

TEXT:  Table 7.1 provides for a running tab on ILO membership.

TEXT:  Moreover, the tripartite representation of countries meant that sending countries’ votes did not uniformly support migrant rights.

TEXT:  However, they could also change the status quo through unilateral action, and this appears to be the least costly method of achieving the desired results. Chetail (2014) notes, for example, that the minimum standard of treatment was contested by Western countries that wanted their nationals to be treated according to standards of “civilized society”; the states used lack of such treatment as an excuse to intervene in the politics of many Latin American countries., LINE: 2043, BOOK: Migration Crises and the Struct, KEYWORD: howev could also chang statu quo unilater action least costli method desir result note exampl minimum standard treatment wa western countri nation accord standard civil societi state use lack treatment excus interven polit mani countri

TEXT:  The balance of the ILO membership slowly shifted during the 1930s to favor sending states. Convention 66, though, responded to the needs of receiving states in Latin America that continued to rely on European migration to develop their economies and resented the prohibitions placed on emigration from Germany, Italy, and other Central European countries during the 1930s as these countries prepared for war (Rodgers et al., LINE: 2046, BOOK: Migration Crises and the Struct, KEYWORD: balanc membership slowli favor send state convent though need state continu reli migrat develop economi prohibit emigr central countri countri prepar war

Tracing the membership of the ILO in terms of the balance between sending and receiving states provides a clear picture of when migrant rights will rise on the agenda and result in a convention., LINE: 2067, BOOK: Migration Crises and the Struct, KEYWORD: order achiev intern dimens statehood new state often sign wide array intern agreement trace membership term balanc send state clear pictur migrant right rise agenda result convent
TEXT:  The unusual tripartite representation and the two-thirds majority required to adopt a convention placed the bar very high so that the balance between sending and receiving states for much of the early history of the ILO prevented migrant rights from rising., LINE: 2068, BOOK: Migration Crises and the Struct, KEYWORD: unusu tripartit represent two third major adopt convent bar high balanc send state much earli histori migrant right rise
TEXT:  That balance began to change as the membership of the ILO expanded, but sending states did not achieve the critical mass necessary to address migrant rights. Directly after World War II, most European countries were still countries of emigration and the displaced populations from the war and initial high unemployment heightened interest in the possibilities for emigration and hence the need for protection of European citizens abroad., LINE: 2069, BOOK: Migration Crises and the Struct, KEYWORD: balanc chang membership expand send state achiev critic mass necessari address migrant right directli world war countri still countri emigr popul war initi high unemploy interest possibl emigr henc need protect citizen abroad
TEXT:  By 1949, new admissions favoring sending countries created a two-thirds majority of sending countries. Thus, a migrant rights treaty was drafted and adopted.

TEXT:  Period 4: ILO Convention 143 (1975).

TEXT:  Independence movements around the globe created new, impoverished nations whose citizens sought better lives abroad. These factors shifted the identity and the number of sending states. As postwar reconstruction in Europe and Japan proceeded, unemployment shrank, “surplus populations” diminished, and many European countries turned to migrants to fill labor market shortages, first from Europe and then from farther afield (Kindleberger 1967)., LINE: 2075, BOOK: Migration Crises and the Struct, KEYWORD: independ movement around globe new nation whose citizen sought better life abroad factor ident number send state postwar reconstruct japan unemploy shrank surplu popul mani countri turn migrant fill labor market shortag first farther afield

TEXT:  As a result, the issue of migrant workers again rose on the agenda of the ILO.

TEXT:  And the balance of power in the ILO was changing to the advantage of this new group of migrant-sending states. The wave of new states that gained independence in the two decades after World War II and joined the United Nations provided for a sending state majority in the ILO, even as some states in the Global South remained or became receiving states (ILO 2009)., LINE: 2078, BOOK: Migration Crises and the Struct, KEYWORD: balanc power wa advantag new group migrant send state wave new state independ two decad world war unit nation provid send state major even state global south state
TEXT: 22 In 1971, the General Conference passed a resolution asking that migrant worker rights be added to the agenda, to ensure equality of treatment in law and in practice for all social and labor issues. In 1972, the vulnerability of migrant workers was publicized through the Mont Blanc tunnel incident, in which a group of workers suffocated in the back of a van when it was stuck in the tunnel., LINE: 2079, BOOK: Migration Crises and the Struct, KEYWORD: gener confer resolut migrant worker right ad agenda ensur equal treatment law practic social labor issu vulner migrant worker wa blanc tunnel incid group worker back van wa stuck tunnel
TEXT: 23 The Mont Blanc incident also raised the visibility of smuggling/trafficking of migrant workers. After the economic crisis of 1973–74, followed by slower economic growth and rising unemployment in Europe, ILO member states in Europe began closing the doors to migration, which pushed migrant workers into the hands of smugglers/traffickers and shifted the balance of migration flows from legal, documented migrants to illegal, undocumented migrants., LINE: 2080, BOOK: Migration Crises and the Struct, KEYWORD: blanc incid also rais visibl smuggl migrant worker econom crisi econom growth rise unemploy member state door migrat migrant worker hand smuggler balanc migrat flow legal migrant illeg undocu migrant

TEXT:  The failure of the ILO treaty to address the concerns of sending countries regarding protections they desired for undocumented workers and the poor ratification rate led to an effort to move the decision-making arena on migrant rights from the ILO to the UN General Assembly., LINE: 2085, BOOK: Migration Crises and the Struct, KEYWORD: failur treati address concern send countri regard protect desir undocu worker poor ratif rate led effort move decis make arena migrant right gener assembl
TEXT:  In this institution, sending states were in a majority and were not hampered by the tripartite representation that characterized the ILO.24 This change in venue is detailed below.

TEXT:  So the efforts of the ILO to provide standards governing labor migration have continued for almost one hundred years—from 1919 to 2016. Given the majority of European sending states that negotiated the ILO and the Charter of Workers Rights in the Versailles Treaty, the issue of migrant rights was present from the beginning, yet the results have been meager., LINE: 2088, BOOK: Migration Crises and the Struct, KEYWORD: effort provid standard govern labor migrat continu almost one hundr year given major send state charter worker right treati issu migrant right wa present begin yet result meager

TEXT:  A modest operational capacity was developed to help move migrants, in particular from Germany and Italy to Latin American countries in the early post–World War II period (Johnston 1970, 117).

TEXT:  However, his entrepreneurship was met with strong opposition from both the United States and the United Kingdom, even though the ILO director was American. As Karatani (2005, 536) describes it, just as the Naples Conference was called, the US House of Representatives was in the process of authorizing funds to help solve the “surplus population problem” in Europe., LINE: 2098, BOOK: Migration Crises and the Struct, KEYWORD: howev wa met strong opposit unit state unit kingdom even though director wa confer wa hous repres wa process fund help solv surplu popul problem

TEXT:  The United States convened a meeting in November 1951, only a month after the Naples Conference. The plans looked remarkably similar to those proposed by the ILO. Yet this time, the United States provided both political and financial support (ten million dollars); as a result, the states attending the conference created the Provisional Intergovernmental Committee for the Movement of Migrants from Europe (PICMME)., LINE: 2102, BOOK: Migration Crises and the Struct, KEYWORD: unit state meet month confer plan remark similar yet time unit state provid polit financi support ten million dollar result state confer provision committe movement migrant

TEXT:  The director named to take over this interim organization was American. When its mandate was extended, it adopted the name Intergovernmental Committee for European Migration (ICEM).

TEXT:  The trajectory of the IOM is described below. US opposition to the ILO plan to gain operational capacity meant that the ILO remains an organization that primarily promotes worker-related standards.

TEXT:  It follows that receiving states are unlikely to ratify the convention. However, as noted above, the migrant rights treaties are not well ratified by either sending or receiving states.

TEXT:  Our unit of analysis is country-year. In order to distinguish between sending and receiving states we employ net migration flows and migrant stocks.

TEXT:  These data also come from the World Development Indicators dataset. Sending state interests are operationalized in terms of remittance inflow. Our theory is consistent with the idea that states dependent on remittance flows will be less likely to ratify the treaty; this is so because sending states are fearful that receiving states are less likely to recruit migrants from states that expect significantly better treatment of their migrants, hence cutting off the remittance flows., LINE: 2150, BOOK: Migration Crises and the Struct, KEYWORD: data also come world develop indic send state interest term remitt inflow theori consist idea state depend remitt flow less like ratifi treati send state fear state less like recruit migrant state expect significantli better treatment migrant henc cut remitt flow

TEXT:  We have measured government capacity in three ways. The first measure is the International Country Risk Guide (ICRG).

TEXT: 4Estimation Results: Migrant Rights Convention (Ratification) The hypotheses that suggest that state capacity is important for treaty signature appear to be wrong.

TEXT:  The government effectiveness indicator is not statistically significant. And the GDP per capita variable in both treaty signature and ratification models is statistically significant but in the wrong direction if we use this as an indicator of bureaucratic capacity—poorer (and therefore less capable) governments are more likely to sign the treaty., LINE: 2171, BOOK: Migration Crises and the Struct, KEYWORD: govern effect indic statist signific per variabl treati signatur ratif model statist signific wrong direct use indic bureaucrat capac therefor less capabl govern like sign treati
TEXT:  These findings suggest that barriers to ratification are not associated with lack of state capacity. The variables that attempt to capture the spread of norms in the international system are significant at the regional level (but not at the global level) for both treaty signature and treaty ratification, providing an indication of regional diffusion: countries whose neighbors sign (ratify) the convention are also more likely to sign the convention., LINE: 2172, BOOK: Migration Crises and the Struct, KEYWORD: find suggest barrier ratif associ lack state capac variabl attempt captur spread norm intern system signific region level global level treati signatur treati ratif provid indic region diffus countri whose neighbor sign ratifi convent also like sign convent
TEXT:  It is not clear whether this is normative behavior or strategic behavior. Simmons (2009) argues that following the path of a state’s neighbors in treaty ratification is a method of camouflage.

TEXT:  The Global Commission on International Migration was followed by the convening of the High Level Dialogue on International Migration held within the auspices of the UN General Assembly in 2006. However, the absence of consensus on a way to move forward propelled the creation of the now annual Global Forum on Migration and Development (GFMD), extracted from the United Nations setting so that states could discuss issues of mutual concern without committing themselves to binding agreements., LINE: 2188, BOOK: Migration Crises and the Struct, KEYWORD: global commiss intern migrat wa high level dialogu intern migrat within auspex gener assembl howev absenc consensu way move forward creation annual global forum migrat develop extract unit nation set state could discu issu mutual concern without bind agreement

TEXT:  BILATERAL COOPERATION ON MIGRANT RIGHTS As suggested by our theoretical framework, bilateral cooperation is the most likely form of cooperation on migration among states.

TEXT:  Even where labor protections are provided, these agreements are limited to the workplace and therefore do not include a broader array of human rights protections. Although the ILO has expressed optimism that bilateral agreements are being signed, a recent review of BLAs in practice indicates that “so far bilateral labor agreements have concerned only a very small share of total bilateral labor migration flows between the countries involved, their implementation has caused quite a lot of frustration in countries of origin, and they have problems of sustainability and continuity over time” (Martin 2011)., LINE: 2224, BOOK: Migration Crises and the Struct, KEYWORD: even labor protect provid agreement limit workplac therefor includ array human right protect although ha express optim bilater agreement recent review bla practic far bilater labor agreement concern small share total bilater labor migrat flow countri involv implement ha quit lot frustrat countri origin problem continu time martin

TEXT:  Broadly speaking, there are two schools of research: the constructivist school that privileges process tracing and case studies (for prominent examples, see Risse, Ropp, and Sikkink 1999, 2013), and the rational choice approach that privileges large-N quantitative analysis (for prominent examples, see Hathaway 2002; Hafner-Burton and Tsutsui 2005; Hafner-Burton and Ron 2009; Simmons 2009)., LINE: 2240, BOOK: Migration Crises and the Struct, KEYWORD: broadli speak two school research constructivist school privileg process trace case studi promin exampl see ropp ration choic approach privileg larg quantit analysi promin exampl see burton burton

TEXT:  Transnational networks are crucial actors, setting off a process of elite concessions and the growth of domestic opposition that ultimately leads to the widespread adoption of human rights.

TEXT:  She also explains “false negatives,” states that adopt human rights protections but that cannot commit to multilateral treaties because of domestic institutions that constrain decision makers in various ways; and “false positives,” states that regularly abuse human rights but sign on to the treaty because they believe the initial benefits outweigh the potential costs., LINE: 2248, BOOK: Migration Crises and the Struct, KEYWORD: also fals neg state adopt human right protect cannot commit multilater treati domest institut constrain decis maker variou way fals posit state regularli abus human right sign treati believ initi benefit outweigh potenti cost

TEXT:  Our approach is most closely associated with an alternative vocabulary that has been employed to describe receiving states’ lack of treaty ratification.

TEXT:  Sovereignty costs are a way of conceptualizing the costs that are generated by states’ adherence to an international agreement. In the words of Simmons and Danner (2010, 235), sovereignty costs are “the costs that a state incurs by delegating a function ordinarily performed domestically to an international institution over which it has little, if any, control., LINE: 2259, BOOK: Migration Crises and the Struct, KEYWORD: sovereignti cost way cost state adher intern agreement word danner sovereignti cost cost state function ordinarili domest intern institut ha littl control

TEXT:  The contemporary refugee regime sorts migrants into “forced” and “voluntary” categories regardless of the mix of motivations, so the scope of “voluntary” migration accounts for the overwhelming majority of individuals living outside their country of origin, whether these are IT specialists, care workers, agricultural laborers, the unemployed, children, or other family members., LINE: 2291, BOOK: Migration Crises and the Struct, KEYWORD: contemporari refuge regim sort migrant forc voluntari categori regardless mix motiv scope voluntari migrat account overwhelm major individu live outsid countri origin whether specialist care worker agricultur labor unemploy child famili member
TEXT:  Nonetheless, we recognize that the voluntary migration regime is intrinsically linked to the refugee and travel regimes. We think that our theoretical and empirical insights may have some applicability to the refugee regime, less so for the travel regime, and we briefly explore those possibilities later in this chapter., LINE: 2292, BOOK: Migration Crises and the Struct, KEYWORD: nonetheless recogn voluntari migrat regim intrins link refuge travel regim think theoret empir insight may applic refuge regim less travel regim briefli explor possibl later chapter
TEXT:  Fully developed applications, however, deserve their own books. While we defined “migration” in a more restrictive manner, our definition of “cooperation” was purposely more expansive. In game theory, cooperation most commonly is viewed as the solution to problems of collective action and public goods provision, where actors share an interest in providing a public good (or preventing a public bad), but no actor wants to incur the costs of providing the good, knowing that other actors might benefit without paying the cost., LINE: 2293, BOOK: Migration Crises and the Struct, KEYWORD: fulli applic howev deserv book defin migrat restrict manner definit wa purpos expans game theori commonli solut problem collect action public good provis actor share interest provid public good public bad actor want incur cost provid good know actor might benefit without pay cost
TEXT:  To overcome this problem, actors engage in cooperative behavior to prevent one side from “cheating” by not contributing while still consuming the good. Cooperation on collective action problems often results in similar types of solutions: formal, institutionalized agreements with strong enforcement mechanisms to prevent cheating by any party., LINE: 2294, BOOK: Migration Crises and the Struct, KEYWORD: overcom problem actor engag behavior prevent one side cheat still consum good collect action problem often result similar type solut formal agreement strong enforc mechan prevent cheat parti
TEXT:  This makes identifying this type of cooperation out in the world fairly straightforward. As we argued, however, voluntary migration presents few problems of collective action. Thus, we loosened our definition of cooperation to include any instances where states negotiate in international forums to address issues related to migration., LINE: 2295, BOOK: Migration Crises and the Struct, KEYWORD: make type world fairli straightforward howev voluntari migrat present problem collect action thu definit includ instanc state negoti intern forum address issu relat migrat
TEXT:  In expanding our definition of cooperation beyond the provision of public goods, we were confronted with a large number of issues and a dizzying array of cooperative responses related to migration at the international, regional, and bilateral levels., LINE: 2296, BOOK: Migration Crises and the Struct, KEYWORD: expand definit beyond provis public good larg number issu array respons relat migrat intern region bilater level
TEXT:  These responses involve numerous organizations, from the IOM to the ILO, the EU, and the UN Office on Drugs and Crime. The results of these cooperative activities range from international conventions to bilateral treaties and periodic talking shops that do not seem to accomplish much in material terms., LINE: 2297, BOOK: Migration Crises and the Struct, KEYWORD: respons involv numer organ offic drug crime result activ rang intern convent bilater treati period talk shop seem accomplish much materi term
TEXT:  Our second empirical challenge, then, was to provide an accounting of all of this activity while making sense of it through a single theoretical framework. The argument of our book has rested on five fundamental claims., LINE: 2298, BOOK: Migration Crises and the Struct, KEYWORD: second empir challeng wa provid account activ make sens singl theoret framework argument book ha five fundament claim
TEXT:  First, post–World War II migration has been primarily unidirectional, from poorer, less stable countries to wealthier, more stable ones. But each country’s migration profile is unique, so externalities (both positive and negative) tend to be bilateral., LINE: 2299, BOOK: Migration Crises and the Struct, KEYWORD: first post world war migrat ha primarili unidirect less stabl countri stabl one countri migrat profil uniqu extern posit neg tend bilater
TEXT:  Thus, when international cooperation does emerge, it also tends to be bilateral. Where economies are similar and flows are reciprocal, regional agreements may emerge, but this is a less common condition., LINE: 2300, BOOK: Migration Crises and the Struct, KEYWORD: thu intern doe emerg also bilater economi similar flow reciproc region agreement may emerg less common condit
TEXT:  Second, the distribution of power within the international system and the status quo ante can explain the paucity of cooperation on migration. Within the contemporary international system, migrant-receiving states are privileged for two reasons: (1) states have sovereignty over admission, but not exit; and (2) sending states tend to be poorer and less powerful., LINE: 2301, BOOK: Migration Crises and the Struct, KEYWORD: second distribut power within intern system statu quo ant explain pauciti migrat within contemporari intern system migrant state privileg two reason state sovereignti admiss exit send state tend less power
TEXT:  As long as receiving states are satisfied with the status quo of unilateral action, cooperation is unlikely to emerge. The cost of the status quo, however, is subject to exogenous shocks, which leads to our third claim: when these shocks (migration crises, domestic pressures, and so on) raise the costs of the status quo for powerful receiving states, they may seek cooperative solutions., LINE: 2302, BOOK: Migration Crises and the Struct, KEYWORD: long state satisfi statu quo unilater action unlik emerg cost statu quo howev subject exogen shock lead third claim shock migrat crisi domest pressur rais cost statu quo power state may seek solut
TEXT:  This does not mean that sending states are completely passive. Our fourth claim is that sending states also may initiate cooperation, or take the lead in shaping it, within institutional contexts that privilege numerical majorities., LINE: 2303, BOOK: Migration Crises and the Struct, KEYWORD: doe mean send state complet passiv fourth claim send state also may initi take lead shape within institut context privileg numer major
TEXT:  Because sending states outnumber receiving states, sending states may use majoritarian institutions to agitate for changes to the status quo that would serve their interests. Such negotiations are unlikely to get far without the support of receiving states, however, and any resulting agreements will likely be poorly ratified and unenforced., LINE: 2304, BOOK: Migration Crises and the Struct, KEYWORD: send state outnumb state send state may use institut agit chang statu quo would serv interest negoti unlik get far without support state howev result agreement like poorli unenforc
TEXT:  Our fifth claim situates migration cooperation within the broader phenomenon of international cooperation. While we commonly think of international cooperation as leading to more openness (for example, through the dismantlement of trade barriers), this is frequently not the case when it comes to migration cooperation., LINE: 2305, BOOK: Migration Crises and the Struct, KEYWORD: fifth claim migrat within phenomenon intern commonli think intern lead open exampl dismantl trade barrier frequent case come migrat
TEXT:  Some of the most extensive and formalized arrangements do not facilitate but rather restrict migration or the movement of people. Readmission agreements, for example, facilitate the return of unwanted migrants, and the Palermo Protocols combat trafficking and smuggling; both instances of cooperation seek to reduce flows, not expand them., LINE: 2306, BOOK: Migration Crises and the Struct, KEYWORD: extens arrang facilit rather restrict migrat movement peopl readmiss agreement exampl facilit return unwant migrant protocol combat smuggl instanc seek reduc flow expand
TEXT:  This sets migration cooperation apart from other types of international cooperation on economic flows, such as trade or finance. These five claims are undergirded by our broader theoretical approach, which seeks to explain the diversity of cooperative activities in migration through a bargaining framework., LINE: 2307, BOOK: Migration Crises and the Struct, KEYWORD: set migrat apart type intern econom flow trade financ five claim theoret approach seek explain divers activ migrat framework
TEXT:  We take the position that states are the central actors in the international system, and their interests are fundamental in explaining the form and substance of cooperative outcomes. Their preferences may be shaped by complex domestic forces and filtered through unique institutional structures, although we do not fully explore the roots of these differences., LINE: 2308, BOOK: Migration Crises and the Struct, KEYWORD: take posit state central actor intern system interest fundament explain form substanc outcom prefer may shape complex domest forc uniqu institut structur although fulli explor root differ
TEXT:  Nevertheless, we argue that these state interests drive international outcomes, and in migration, state preferences depend largely on “market conditions,” or the state’s position as primarily a migrant-sending or migrant-receiving state., LINE: 2309, BOOK: Migration Crises and the Struct, KEYWORD: nevertheless argu state interest drive intern outcom migrat state prefer depend larg market condit state posit primarili migrant send migrant state
TEXT:  As we noted in our second premise, these market conditions also correlate with state power; migrant-receiving states tend to be more powerful, while sending states are less powerful, at least in the contemporary era., LINE: 2310, BOOK: Migration Crises and the Struct, KEYWORD: note second premis market condit also correl state power migrant state tend power send state less power least contemporari era
TEXT:  Our bargaining framework began with the status quo ante. When all states are satisfied with the status quo ante, there is no incentive for cooperation, and all will continue to pursue unilateral action., LINE: 2311, BOOK: Migration Crises and the Struct, KEYWORD: framework statu quo ant state satisfi statu quo ant incent continu pursu unilater action
TEXT:  When this equilibrium is disturbed, or when at least one state is dissatisfied with the status quo, cooperation may emerge. We suggested that there are two mechanisms that may trigger negotiations. First, exogenous events may raise the cost of the status quo for receiving states, prompting them to initiate bargaining with sending states as a way to reduce these new costs., LINE: 2312, BOOK: Migration Crises and the Struct, KEYWORD: equilibrium disturb least one state dissatisfi statu quo may emerg two mechan may trigger negoti first exogen event may rais cost statu quo state initi send state way reduc new cost
TEXT:  Second, sending states that are dissatisfied with the status quo may find an international forum where they can get their concerns on the agenda and initiate negotiations. Because most states in the international system are sending states, their interests are privileged within institutions based on state membership and majoritarian rules., LINE: 2313, BOOK: Migration Crises and the Struct, KEYWORD: second send state dissatisfi statu quo may find intern forum get concern agenda initi negoti state intern system send state interest privileg within institut base state membership rule
TEXT:  This institutional power can even lead to international treaties, although we argue that these will be poorly ratified and enforced if powerful receiving states do not support them. States do not have to share interests for cooperation to succeed; the bargaining framework explicitly allows for quid pro quo agreements facilitated by side payments., LINE: 2314, BOOK: Migration Crises and the Struct, KEYWORD: institut power even lead intern treati although argu poorli enforc power state support state share interest succeed framework explicitli quid pro quo agreement side payment
TEXT:  Powerful receiving states are likely to have more resources to facilitate these types of agreements, so we do expect that cooperation is more likely when powerful states desire a change in the status quo., LINE: 2315, BOOK: Migration Crises and the Struct, KEYWORD: power state like resourc facilit type agreement expect like power state desir chang statu quo
TEXT:  Sending states have an additional advantage beyond their numerical majority, however; these states can also leverage their cooperation to extract concessions from receiving states if they have better outside options than receiving states., LINE: 2316, BOOK: Migration Crises and the Struct, KEYWORD: send state addit advantag beyond numer major howev state also leverag extract concess state better outsid option state
TEXT:  If sending states continue to prefer the status quo, receiving states must induce them to cooperate. This basic bargaining framework generated five main hypotheses: H1a Where migration flows are unidirectional and unique and regime support costs exceed negotiation transaction costs, international agreements on migration will be bilateral., LINE: 2317, BOOK: Migration Crises and the Struct, KEYWORD: send state continu prefer statu quo state must induc basic framework five main hypothesi migrat flow unidirect uniqu regim support cost exceed negoti transact cost intern agreement migrat bilater

TEXT:  (Claim 2) H3a When less powerful states act as a coalition and find a forum that provides institutional power, bargaining is more likely to occur.

TEXT:  (Claim 4) H4 When the costs of the status quo ante rise, receiving states are more likely to initiate international negotiations.

TEXT:  (Claim 3) We evaluated these hypotheses across what we consider to be the four main issue areas within the realm of voluntary migration: labor recruitment and freedom of movement, migration control, criminality, and migrant rights., LINE: 2321, BOOK: Migration Crises and the Struct, KEYWORD: claim hypothesi across consid four main issu area within realm voluntari migrat labor recruit freedom movement migrat control crimin migrant right
TEXT:  Across all four issues, we found a distinct mix of cooperative efforts, which have achieved varying degrees of success, at the bilateral, regional, and multilateral levels. In almost every case, these efforts coexist alongside unilateral action., LINE: 2322, BOOK: Migration Crises and the Struct, KEYWORD: across four issu found distinct mix effort degre success bilater region multilater level almost everi case effort coexist alongsid unilater action

TEXT:  In every case, our bargaining framework has been useful in explaining this diversity of outcomes. While the bargaining is simplest with just two parties (State A and State B), the logic of the model applies to multiple actor negotiations as well., LINE: 2324, BOOK: Migration Crises and the Struct, KEYWORD: everi case framework ha use explain divers outcom two parti state state logic model multipl actor negoti well
TEXT:  In some cases, a negotiated win set includes only two states, resulting in a bilateral agreement. In other cases, a negotiated win set may include many states, resulting in a multilateral agreement.

TEXT:  CONTROLLING IMMIGRATION: MIGRANT CRISES AS A KEY DRIVER OF COOPERATION In chapter 3, we examined the challenge of restricting migration flows, in particular, interior immigration control, as border controls are a component part of the travel regime., LINE: 2326, BOOK: Migration Crises and the Struct, KEYWORD: immigr migrant crisi key driver chapter challeng migrat flow particular interior immigr control border control compon part travel regim
TEXT:  We argued that sending, receiving, and transit states generally have clearly disparate preferences. Transit and sending states generally do not want to accept their citizens who have found employment in receiving states even though they may be there without proper documentation., LINE: 2327, BOOK: Migration Crises and the Struct, KEYWORD: send transit state gener clearli dispar prefer transit send state gener want accept citizen found employ state even though may without proper document
TEXT:  Receiving states, on the other hand, prefer to return unwanted and undocumented migrants. There are no public goods or coordination problems to solve, so states must rely on quid pro quo bargaining if they are to reach any agreement., LINE: 2328, BOOK: Migration Crises and the Struct, KEYWORD: state hand prefer return unwant undocu migrant public good problem solv state must reli quid pro quo reach agreement
TEXT:  We found that, as expected, the necessary conditions under which cooperation on restricting migrant flows will emerge are indeed rare. We find, in accordance with Hypothesis 1a, that the most extensive, formalized cooperation has taken the form of bilateral readmission agreements, and most of these have been concluded with European states., LINE: 2329, BOOK: Migration Crises and the Struct, KEYWORD: found necessari condit migrant flow emerg inde rare find accord hypothesi extens ha taken form bilater readmiss agreement state
TEXT:  In support of Hypothesis 4, cooperation on migration control is largely driven by the demands of powerful receiving states, reacting to rising costs in retaining the status quo. As the costs of unwanted migration grow and the ability of receiving states to control immigration unilaterally declines, receiving states are more likely to seek cooperation with sending and transit states., LINE: 2330, BOOK: Migration Crises and the Struct, KEYWORD: support hypothesi migrat control larg driven demand power state rise cost retain statu quo cost unwant migrat grow abil state control immigr unilater declin state like seek send transit state
TEXT:  Over the past sixty years, European states have increasingly sacrificed sovereignty over migration control for the sake of greater economic and political unity, most significantly with the Schengen Agreement, which created a common external border and freedom of movement within the Schengen Area., LINE: 2331, BOOK: Migration Crises and the Struct, KEYWORD: past sixti year state increasingli sovereignti migrat control sake greater econom polit uniti significantli agreement common extern border freedom movement within area
TEXT:  These changes to the status quo made European states more likely than other receiving states to pursue cooperation on control with sending states, as they are less able to control immigration unilaterally., LINE: 2332, BOOK: Migration Crises and the Struct, KEYWORD: chang statu quo made state like state pursu control send state less abl control immigr unilater
TEXT:  Even within Europe, however, we found variation in the number of readmission agreements concluded by receiving states. This variation can be explained by variation in the costs generated by the status quo, unique to each state., LINE: 2333, BOOK: Migration Crises and the Struct, KEYWORD: even within howev found variat number readmiss agreement state variat variat cost statu quo uniqu state
TEXT:  We found that increases in immigration from a particular sending state, economic downturns, and an increase in electoral support for right-wing parties are all associated with an increase in the number of readmission agreements concluded by receiving states., LINE: 2334, BOOK: Migration Crises and the Struct, KEYWORD: found increas immigr particular send state econom downturn increas elector support right wing parti associ increas number readmiss agreement state
TEXT:  Each of these factors indicates an increase in the costs of unwanted immigration, which then makes the side payments needed to induce cooperation from sending and transit states worthwhile for receiving states., LINE: 2335, BOOK: Migration Crises and the Struct, KEYWORD: factor increas cost unwant immigr make side payment induc send transit state state
TEXT:  As expected, we found that regional cooperation on migration control is less common. While there are some EU-wide agreements, these have been much harder to conclude and are fewer in number, even though the EU gained the competency to negotiate such agreements in 1999., LINE: 2336, BOOK: Migration Crises and the Struct, KEYWORD: found region migrat control less common wide agreement much harder conclud number even though compet negoti agreement
TEXT:  The preference for bilateralism is driven by the fact that different European states receive immigrants from different sending states. The EU has less to offer in terms of side payments, since one of the main inducements for signing is the promise of visa-free travel, which remains the prerogative of individual member states., LINE: 2337, BOOK: Migration Crises and the Struct, KEYWORD: prefer bilater driven fact differ state receiv immigr differ send state ha less offer term side payment sinc one main induc promis visa free travel remain prerog individu member state
TEXT:  This makes it more difficult for the EU to conclude agreements. The major hurdle, however, is the fact that European states have used bilateral readmission agreements as a way to reassert sovereignty over migration enforcement, which they lost by agreeing to free movement in the Schengen Agreement., LINE: 2338, BOOK: Migration Crises and the Struct, KEYWORD: make difficult conclud agreement major hurdl howev fact state use bilater readmiss agreement way reassert sovereignti migrat enforc lost agre free movement agreement
TEXT:  Relinquishing the tool to the EU undermines its usefulness for individual states. The current migration crisis in Europe is a specific illustration of what happens when there are rising costs associated with the status quo., LINE: 2339, BOOK: Migration Crises and the Struct, KEYWORD: tool use individu state current migrat crisi specif illustr rise cost associ statu quo
TEXT:  Consistent with our fifth hypothesis, sending states may be able to extract more concessions from receiving states when changes to the status quo ante provide sending states with better outside options than receiving states., LINE: 2340, BOOK: Migration Crises and the Struct, KEYWORD: consist fifth hypothesi send state may abl extract concess state chang statu quo ant provid send state better outsid option state
TEXT:  We found that sending and transit states affected by the crisis are now demanding more compensation from receiving states, even if they have preexisting readmission agreements with individual European states., LINE: 2341, BOOK: Migration Crises and the Struct, KEYWORD: found send transit state affect crisi demand compens state even readmiss agreement individu state
TEXT:  Turkey, for example, negotiated better compensation from the EU in exchange for a readmission agreement, even as it failed to fulfill its obligations under its preexisting agreement with Greece. This is also an example of our claim that cooperation on migration often leads to reduced, rather than enhanced, migratory flows., LINE: 2342, BOOK: Migration Crises and the Struct, KEYWORD: turkey exampl better compens exchang readmiss agreement even fulfil oblig agreement also exampl claim migrat often lead reduc rather enhanc migratori flow
TEXT:  Outside of readmission agreements, we identified RCPs as the most common cooperative forum for addressing issues of migration control. There are several of these informal processes involving different groups of states around the world., LINE: 2343, BOOK: Migration Crises and the Struct, KEYWORD: outsid readmiss agreement common forum issu migrat control sever inform process differ group state around world
TEXT:  The institutional structure of RCPs means that the costs of participation are quite low, discussions within the processes are generally confidential or at least low-profile, the agenda is completely open, and decisions or recommendations are not binding on participants., LINE: 2344, BOOK: Migration Crises and the Struct, KEYWORD: institut structur mean cost particip quit low discuss within process gener confidenti least low profil agenda complet open decis recommend bind particip
TEXT:  Since each state has an equal position within the institutional structure, we find that sending states are able to get their interests on the agenda. For example, the Forum for Dialogue in the Western Mediterranean’s Malta Declaration section titled “Migration and Development” explicitly links migration control to resolving the root causes of irregular migration, specifically, the lack of economic development in sending states., LINE: 2345, BOOK: Migration Crises and the Struct, KEYWORD: sinc state ha equal posit within institut structur find send state abl get interest agenda exampl forum dialogu western mediterranean declar section titl migrat develop explicitli link migrat control root caus irregular migrat specif lack econom develop send state
TEXT:  This reflected the interests of sending states, but the declaration made no concrete commitments nor demanded specific action from receiving states. This supported our third set of hypotheses (3a and 3b), which stated that bargaining is more likely to occur when less powerful states act as a coalition and find a forum that provides institutional power (in this case, the RCP), with the caveat that an agreement is unlikely to be ratified or enforced without the support of powerful states., LINE: 2346, BOOK: Migration Crises and the Struct, KEYWORD: reflect interest send state declar made concret commit specif action state third set hypothesi state like occur less power state act coalit find forum institut power case caveat agreement unlik enforc without support power state
TEXT:  In the case of the Malta Declaration, there were no commitments that even had to be ratified, just a general acknowledgment of the link between development and unwanted immigration. Last, cooperation on migration control illustrated our fifth premise: some of the most extensive and formalized cooperative arrangements do not facilitate migration but instead restrict it., LINE: 2347, BOOK: Migration Crises and the Struct, KEYWORD: case declar commit even gener link develop unwant immigr last migrat control fifth premis extens arrang facilit migrat instead restrict
TEXT:  Readmission agreements are formal international treaties, and their number continues to grow. While the side payments that receiving states might offer sending states could facilitate migration (through, for example, visa-free travel and expanded legal immigration), the restrictions on migration far outweigh the corresponding expansions., LINE: 2348, BOOK: Migration Crises and the Struct, KEYWORD: readmiss agreement formal intern treati number grow side payment state might offer send state could facilit migrat exampl visa free travel expand legal immigr restrict migrat far outweigh correspond expans
TEXT:  LABOR RECRUITMENT: MARKET FORCES AND MARKET FAILURES In chapter 4, we examined interstate cooperation to facilitate labor recruitment.

TEXT:  Powerful receiving states usually have been able to meet their labor needs domestically or by simply relaxing immigration controls unilaterally and allowing labor market mechanisms to match immigrant labor with employers., LINE: 2350, BOOK: Migration Crises and the Struct, KEYWORD: power state usual abl meet labor need domest simpli immigr control unilater labor market mechan match immigr labor employ
TEXT:  Only under rare circumstances in which market mechanisms have failed have receiving states been motivated to conclude labor recruitment agreements.

TEXT:  Supporting Hypothesis 1a, we found that virtually all labor recruitment agreements have been bilateral, and almost never regional or multilateral. As predicted by Hypothesis 2, even bilateral agreements are rare; as long as powerful receiving states are satisfied with the unilateral status quo, cooperation is unlikely to occur., LINE: 2352, BOOK: Migration Crises and the Struct, KEYWORD: support hypothesi found virtual labor recruit agreement bilater almost never region multilater hypothesi even bilater agreement rare long power state satisfi unilater statu quo unlik occur
TEXT:  Receiving states will pursue cooperation with sending states only when there is both unmet labor demand and a failure of the market to meet this demand. Market failures are the result of informational asymmetries and adjustment costs., LINE: 2353, BOOK: Migration Crises and the Struct, KEYWORD: state pursu send state unmet labor demand failur market meet demand market failur result inform asymmetri adjust cost
TEXT:  Although these costs are never zero, dense migrant networks, cheap transportation, and geographic proximity can reduce them, again making labor markets function better and international agreements less likely., LINE: 2354, BOOK: Migration Crises and the Struct, KEYWORD: although cost never zero dens migrant network cheap transport geograph proxim reduc make labor market function better intern agreement less like
TEXT:  We first examined multilateral and regional efforts to facilitate labor mobility and, as expected, found little cooperative behavior.

TEXT:  We next surveyed twenty-eight REOs for evidence of labor mobility agreements and found very few. We distinguished among three types of cooperation: (1) free movement (à la the EU), (2) temporary movement to facilitate trade and investment (à la the GATS Mode 4), and (3) facilitated entry and temporary stay but no access to the labor market (à la APEC) (IOM 2007)., LINE: 2357, BOOK: Migration Crises and the Struct, KEYWORD: next twenti eight evid labor mobil agreement found distinguish among three type free movement temporari movement facilit trade invest gat mode entri temporari stay access labor market
TEXT: 1 Of the twenty-eight organizations surveyed, we found that only four have implemented freedom of movement (the EU, EEA, GCC, and OECS).

TEXT:  The United Kingdom, on the other hand, had no need to pursue BLAs even after establishing a government-led committee (the Foreign Labor Committee) to oversee recruitment. Unlike France, the United Kingdom already had well-established migrant networks due to Irish, colonial, and Commonwealth migration, which mitigated informational asymmetries and adjustment costs., LINE: 2365, BOOK: Migration Crises and the Struct, KEYWORD: unit kingdom hand need pursu bla even govern led committe foreign labor committe overse recruit unlik unit kingdom alreadi well establish migrant network due coloni commonwealth migrat inform asymmetri adjust cost

TEXT:  The second wave of BLAs originated in more diverse locales. Oil wealth in the Gulf States fueled unmet labor demand there, leading to BLAs with Asian source countries. Likewise, economic growth in Southeast Asia created unmet labor demand that was exacerbated by new opportunities for citizens from East Asia in the Gulf states, motivating a need for BLAs there., LINE: 2367, BOOK: Migration Crises and the Struct, KEYWORD: second wave bla divers local oil wealth gulf state unmet labor demand lead bla sourc countri likewis econom growth southeast unmet labor demand wa new opportun citizen east gulf state need bla
TEXT:  And in Europe, the fall of the Soviet Bloc led to a new wave of BLAs between Western European receiving states and sending states in Central and Eastern Europe. We argued that the third wave of BLAs, if it exists, is composed of agreements that are less about facilitating migration than rewarding sending states for successfully controlling unwanted migration., LINE: 2368, BOOK: Migration Crises and the Struct, KEYWORD: fall soviet bloc led new wave bla western state send state central eastern third wave bla compos agreement less migrat reward send state success unwant migrat
TEXT:  The most recent agreements, then, are motivated not by market failures—neither informational asymmetries nor adjustment costs—but rather by a need for control. The motivating logic for them is then quite different; these BLAs are side payments made to sending states for cooperation on migration control, which we addressed in chapter 3., LINE: 2369, BOOK: Migration Crises and the Struct, KEYWORD: recent agreement market failur neither inform asymmetri adjust cost rather need control logic quit differ bla side payment made send state migrat control chapter

TEXT:  Labor recruitment and mobility is one exception to this general trend but, of all the migration issues covered in this book, this is the one on which we see the least cooperation. FREEDOM OF MOVEMENT: HISTORICAL ANTECEDENTS AND CONTEMPORARY PRACTICES The first claim on which the argument of our book has rested is that post–World War II migration has been primarily unilateral, from poorer, less stable countries to wealthier, more stable ones, and that each country’s migration profile is unique., LINE: 2371, BOOK: Migration Crises and the Struct, KEYWORD: labor recruit mobil one except gener trend migrat issu cover book one see least freedom movement histor anteced contemporari practic first claim argument book ha post world war migrat ha primarili unilater less stabl countri stabl one countri migrat profil uniqu

TEXT:  Following Hypothesis 1b, the most basic difference between freedom of movement and labor recruitment is that the migratory flows are not unidirectional, and thus involve states that cannot be easily categorized as either sending or receiving states in relation to each other., LINE: 2374, BOOK: Migration Crises and the Struct, KEYWORD: follow hypothesi basic differ freedom movement labor recruit migratori flow unidirect thu involv state cannot easili either send state relat
TEXT:  Instead, states in these regions had a long history of reciprocal movement, which enhanced economic efficiency by allowing labor flows to respond to changes in demand. This was facilitated by similar standards of living and levels of social service provision between neighboring states, oftentimes coupled with a common language and culture., LINE: 2375, BOOK: Migration Crises and the Struct, KEYWORD: instead state region long histori reciproc movement enhanc econom effici labor flow respond chang demand wa similar standard live level social servic provis neighbor state oftentim coupl common languag cultur

TEXT:  In all the cases in which cooperation on free movement occurred, we identified exogenous shocks that changed the status quo of unilateral action. These included labor market shortages, regional economic integration, and, in the case of Australia and New Zealand, a change in the migration policy of the former colonial power, the United Kingdom., LINE: 2377, BOOK: Migration Crises and the Struct, KEYWORD: case free movement exogen shock statu quo unilater action includ labor market shortag region econom integr case new chang migrat polici former coloni power unit kingdom
TEXT:  The institutional response of creating a free movement zone instead of more restrictive bilateral labor mobility agreements depended on the involved states’ level of familiarity with each other and their certainty that flows would remain reciprocal over the long term., LINE: 2378, BOOK: Migration Crises and the Struct, KEYWORD: institut respons free movement zone instead restrict bilater labor mobil agreement involv state level familiar certainti flow would remain reciproc long term

TEXT:  In the 1990s, the EU received a wave of applications for accession following the collapse of communism from states that clearly did not share the same standard of living as the current member states. The EU was constrained to either offering membership, with all of its benefits including freedom of movement, or excluding the applicants altogether at great political and economic cost., LINE: 2380, BOOK: Migration Crises and the Struct, KEYWORD: receiv wave applic access follow collaps commun state clearli share standard live current member state wa constrain either offer membership benefit freedom movement exclud applic altogeth great polit econom cost

TEXT:  The decision to admit the new members despite this uncertainty was due to the institutional constraints imposed by the EU’s governing documents; if the old members could have excluded the new members from free movement without weakening the union more broadly, they likely would have., LINE: 2382, BOOK: Migration Crises and the Struct, KEYWORD: decis admit new member despit uncertainti wa due institut constraint govern document old member could new member free movement without weaken union broadli like would
TEXT:  The Trans-Tasman migration had been characterized by reciprocity since Australia and New Zealand were first colonized by the British, but there was little need of codification until the United Kingdom abolished most of the migration privileges for Commonwealth citizens in 1971., LINE: 2383, BOOK: Migration Crises and the Struct, KEYWORD: migrat reciproc sinc new first wa littl need codif unit kingdom migrat privileg commonwealth citizen
TEXT:  The agreement, however, was informal and nonbinding, which meant that it did not constrain either state from making a change if circumstances shifted, and this is exactly what happened. In 2001, Australia unilaterally amended the agreement to restrict the ability of New Zealanders to become permanent residents and access social welfare benefits., LINE: 2384, BOOK: Migration Crises and the Struct, KEYWORD: agreement howev wa inform meant constrain either state make chang circumst exactli unilater agreement restrict abil new becom perman resid access social welfar benefit
TEXT:  This change was not only a response to increasingly unilateral flows from New Zealand, as opposed to the historically reciprocal ones, but also a response to demographic changes within these flows, which included more nonnative New Zealanders who had immigrated to New Zealand from third countries., LINE: 2385, BOOK: Migration Crises and the Struct, KEYWORD: chang wa respons increasingli unilater flow new oppos histor reciproc one also respons demograph chang within flow includ nonn new new third countri

TEXT:  We discovered two organizations in the Global South that also met the required conditions: GCC and OECS.

TEXT:  Once freedom of movement was in place, however, as in our other cases, mobility remained low—the incentives to move were not large. The GCC is interesting, too, because of the exclusion of the seventh Arabian peninsula state, Yemen., LINE: 2389, BOOK: Migration Crises and the Struct, KEYWORD: freedom movement wa place howev case mobil low incent move larg interest exclus seventh peninsula state
TEXT:  Consistent with our theory, this exclusion is ascribed to wealth disparities in a country that lacks the oil deposits of its neighbors. In summary, all five cases of freedom of movement that we documented substantiated Hypothesis 1b; where flows tend toward reciprocity, freedom of movement becomes possible., LINE: 2390, BOOK: Migration Crises and the Struct, KEYWORD: consist theori exclus wealth dispar countri lack oil deposit neighbor summari five case freedom movement hypothesi flow tend toward reciproc freedom movement becom possibl

TEXT:  CRIMINALITY IN MIGRATION: SUCCESSFUL MULTILATERAL COOPERATION In chapter 6, we examined problems of criminality, specifically responses to human trafficking and smuggling. We argued that states have a common interest in reducing crime and maintaining the rule of law, which is reflected in a century-long history of multilateral treaties that are well ratified., LINE: 2392, BOOK: Migration Crises and the Struct, KEYWORD: crimin migrat success multilater chapter problem crimin specif respons human smuggl state common interest reduc crime rule law reflect centuri long histori multilater treati well

TEXT:  The multifaceted nature of the trafficking and smuggling problem actually tapped into a variety of state interests.

TEXT:  This outcome, however, does not contradict our first claim that flows tend to come from poorer, less stable countries to wealthier, more stable ones, and that these flows tend to create unique bilateral migration profiles, leading to bilateral cooperation., LINE: 2396, BOOK: Migration Crises and the Struct, KEYWORD: outcom howev doe contradict first claim flow tend come less stabl countri stabl one flow tend creat uniqu bilater migrat profil lead bilater
TEXT:  Even though trafficking and smuggling flows also create unique bilateral profiles, receiving states chose to negotiate multilaterally because the side payments needed to induce cooperation from sending states were low and the efficiency benefits of multilateralism were relatively high., LINE: 2397, BOOK: Migration Crises and the Struct, KEYWORD: even though smuggl flow also creat uniqu bilater profil state chose negoti multilater side payment induc send state low effici benefit rel high
TEXT:  Because trafficking and smuggling are associated with criminality that challenges the state, we argued that sending states share an interest with receiving states in curtailing both; receiving states did not need to buy the support of sending states., LINE: 2398, BOOK: Migration Crises and the Struct, KEYWORD: smuggl associ crimin challeng state send state share interest state state need buy support send state
TEXT:  Primarily reflecting the concerns of receiving states, the Palermo Protocols have little to say about the exact responsibilities that these states have to victims of trafficking and smuggling. However, as predicted by our third set of hypotheses (H3a and H3b), sending states have used other forums, where they institutionally have more power, to bring up the issue as well., LINE: 2399, BOOK: Migration Crises and the Struct, KEYWORD: primarili reflect concern state protocol littl say exact state victim smuggl howev third set hypothesi send state use forum institut power bring issu well
TEXT:  Human trafficking and smuggling are a top priority in the informal RCPs, which structurally provide all participating states with an equal voice.

TEXT:  These efforts have resulted in few concrete actions, and the projects that have been implemented are largely related to the criminality aspect of trafficking and smuggling as well, not the human rights of victims or socioeconomic conditions in sending states that generate the supply of trafficked and smuggled individuals., LINE: 2401, BOOK: Migration Crises and the Struct, KEYWORD: effort concret action project larg relat crimin aspect smuggl well human right victim socioeconom condit send state gener suppli individu

TEXT:  Instead, cooperation is specifically designed to curtail migration facilitated by traffickers and smugglers.

TEXT:  MIGRANT RIGHTS AND THE FAILURE OF MULTILATERAL COOPERATION In chapter 7, we examined the protection of migrant rights.

TEXT:  But sending states also want more open migration, allowing greater access for their citizens.

TEXT:  International conventions on migrant rights have largely stalled or been ineffective, including the ICRMW and various ILO conventions. We argued that the most effective strategy for ensuring migrant rights is to pursue national policies; human rights and labor rights advocates can pressure states to make unilateral, domestic changes in migrant rights protection., LINE: 2408, BOOK: Migration Crises and the Struct, KEYWORD: intern convent migrant right larg ineffect variou convent effect strategi migrant right pursu nation polici human right labor right advoc pressur state make unilater domest chang migrant right protect
TEXT:  Multilateral cooperation on migrant rights has largely failed, although states have attempted to conclude agreements at least since the Treaty of Versailles.

TEXT:  The more puzzling question was why there were repeated efforts at all; in addition to the ICRMW, the ILO included migrant rights in its original remit, and it explicitly attempted to address migrant rights in subsequent conventions (Conventions 66 in 1939, 97 in 1949, and 143 in 1975)., LINE: 2410, BOOK: Migration Crises and the Struct, KEYWORD: puzzl question wa repeat effort addit includ migrant right origin remit explicitli address migrant right subsequ convent convent

TEXT:  Since the original ILO membership was small and dominated by these powerful states, they were able to ensure that migrant rights were in the original remit.

TEXT:  It was only later, in the post–World War II period, that European states’ interests changed as they transitioned into receiving states. As poorer and less stable sending states obtained independence and began to outnumber powerful receiving states, they used their institutional power within the ILO to put migrant rights on the agenda and introduce multilateral treaties., LINE: 2413, BOOK: Migration Crises and the Struct, KEYWORD: wa later post world war period state interest state less stabl send state independ outnumb power state use institut power within put migrant right agenda introduc multilater treati

TEXT:  In many ways, our story of cooperation on migrant rights was one about the absence of cooperation.

TEXT:  States may act unilaterally to protect migrant rights in response to domestic pressure, and they have, although they often do so under the banner of human rights or labor rights. THEORETICAL APPLICATIONS FOR THE REFUGEE AND TRAVEL REGIMES At the beginning of this book, we explicitly limited our study to the voluntary, or economic, migration regime, and we excluded the refugee and travel regimes., LINE: 2418, BOOK: Migration Crises and the Struct, KEYWORD: state may act unilater protect migrant right respons domest pressur although often banner human right labor right theoret applic refuge travel regim begin book explicitli limit studi voluntari econom migrat regim refuge travel regim

TEXT:  In the current refugee regime, the status quo is the 1951 Refugee Convention. At the time the convention was drafted and ratified, refugee flows looked very different than they do today. In the aftermath of World Wars I and II, most refugees were European., LINE: 2420, BOOK: Migration Crises and the Struct, KEYWORD: current refuge regim statu quo refuge convent time convent wa refuge flow differ today aftermath world war refuge
TEXT:  European states were also politically powerful, and they used this power to create a binding international agreement, obligating states to the principle of non-refoulement of any individual outside of his or her country of origin whose life or rights might be threatened because of race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion., LINE: 2421, BOOK: Migration Crises and the Struct, KEYWORD: state also polit power use power creat bind intern agreement state principl non individu outsid countri origin whose life right might race religion nation membership particular social group polit opinion
TEXT:  The Refugee Convention also served a political purpose in the context of the Cold War, beyond dealing with the pragmatic concerns about European refugees. It prioritized the values of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and its emphasis on individualism and political freedoms, thus elevating these rights above social rights prioritized by the communist states, such as access to food, health care, and education (Innes 2015; Hathaway 1991)., LINE: 2422, BOOK: Migration Crises and the Struct, KEYWORD: refuge convent also polit purpos context cold war beyond deal pragmat concern refuge valu univers declar human right emphasi individu polit freedom thu elev right social right communist state access food health care educ

TEXT:  It was expanded in the 1967 Protocol to include refugees from all countries, before and after 1951. During the same time period, though, UN member states rejected an alternative agreement, the Declaration on Territorial Asylum, which would have required not just non-refoulement but also admission, and not just territorial asylum but also diplomatic asylum (meaning that asylum seekers would only have to present themselves at an embassy, not physically travel to the country in which the wish to seek asylum) (Innes 2015)., LINE: 2424, BOOK: Migration Crises and the Struct, KEYWORD: wa expand protocol includ refuge countri time period though member state altern agreement declar territori asylum would non also admiss territori asylum also diplomat asylum mean asylum seeker would present embassi physic travel countri wish seek asylum
TEXT:  With these limitations inherent to the Refugee Convention firmly in place, the expansions in the 1967 Protocol did not threaten the politically powerful states. In fact, they protected them from the new refugee flows generated by anticolonial struggles in Africa and elsewhere during the 1960s., LINE: 2425, BOOK: Migration Crises and the Struct, KEYWORD: limit inher refuge convent firmli place expans protocol threaten polit power state fact new refuge flow struggl elsewher
TEXT: 2 This history is consistent with Hypotheses 1b and 4 in that, in the immediate post–World War II period, refugee flows were regional and reciprocal within the region.

TEXT:  The recent “migration” or refugee crisis in Europe does little to change the fundamental calculus of powerful states when it comes to the refugee regime.

TEXT:  Instead, we identified these other types of cooperation as rational solutions to particular policy challenges and endpoints themselves.

TEXT:  First, as noted in chapter 1, the research on “lateralisms,” or international regime membership size, remains underdeveloped.

TEXT:  We have adopted what we believe is a useful framework for analyzing the type of international agreement that is likely to arise: bilateral, regional, or multilateral (Thompson and Verdier 2014). This framework juxtaposes the transaction costs of negotiating many treaties with the costs of regime maintenance engendered by the “membership surplus,” the benefits that arise for many states when the regime is structured to attract the state with the highest compliance cost., LINE: 2448, BOOK: Migration Crises and the Struct, KEYWORD: adopt believ use framework type intern agreement like aris bilater region multilater framework transact cost mani treati cost regim mainten membership surplu benefit aris mani state regim structur attract state highest complianc cost

TEXT:  For example, when FDI was concentrated among wealthy Western democracies, reciprocal flows generated informal cooperation and voluntary guidelines.

TEXT:  However, this leads us to our third point, that international treaties are binding only on those states that ratify them. At least in the arena of international migration, the negotiation of treaties does not necessarily portend cooperation, if the states that are necessary to put the regime into effect are absent (Western 2015)., LINE: 2455, BOOK: Migration Crises and the Struct, KEYWORD: howev lead third point intern treati bind state ratifi least arena intern migrat negoti treati doe necessarili portend state necessari put regim effect absent western

TEXT:  More attention to the rise of poorly ratified treaties is in order, as is research on the impact of these treaties on state behavior.

TEXT:  We turn to the potential policy lessons below. POLICY LESSONS? In 2011, the Transatlantic Council on Migration published a book titled Improving the Governance of International Migration, stating that “most actors agree that greater international cooperation on migration is needed., LINE: 2459, BOOK: Migration Crises and the Struct, KEYWORD: turn potenti polici lesson polici lesson transatlant council migrat book titl improv govern intern migrat actor agre greater intern migrat
TEXT: ” The book then went on to explore the key steps to building a more cooperative system of governance and the goals that could be achieved (Transatlantic Council on Migration 2011). In 2013, the OECD’s David Khoudour (head of the Migration and Skills Unit) wrote that “the phenomenon of migration today requires an international cooperation framework that views migrants not only through a security lens, but as key players in countries’ economic and social development” (Khoudour 2013, 2)., LINE: 2460, BOOK: Migration Crises and the Struct, KEYWORD: book went explor key step build system govern goal could transatlant council migrat head migrat skill unit wrote phenomenon migrat today intern framework view migrant secur len key player countri econom social develop

TEXT:  Like Pope Francis, we certainly support improving conditions and living standards for the millions of migrants who leave their homes in search of better lives.

TEXT:  Advocates of international cooperation sometimes assume that cooperation in one venue or on one issue can (and will) grow deeper and broader. We strongly disagree with this assumption. States are strategic, and they will pursue cooperation when it serves their interests., LINE: 2464, BOOK: Migration Crises and the Struct, KEYWORD: advoc intern sometim assum one venu one issu grow strongli disagre assumpt state strateg pursu serf interest
TEXT:  We do not mean that cooperation cannot be lasting or self-reinforcing—it can. But pursuing international cooperation can also be costly for states; it may involve some forfeiture of sovereignty, a transfer of resources to another state, compromise, and a loss of unilateral authority., LINE: 2465, BOOK: Migration Crises and the Struct, KEYWORD: mean cannot last self intern also costli state may involv forfeitur sovereignti transfer resourc anoth state compromis loss unilater author
TEXT:  States calculate the ratio of costs and benefits to cooperation, and they act accordingly. There may be some role for trust building and establishing a working relationship in advancing future cooperation, since this can lower the costs of cooperation, but these features will not outweigh material interests., LINE: 2466, BOOK: Migration Crises and the Struct, KEYWORD: state calcul ratio cost benefit act accordingli may role trust build work relationship advanc futur sinc lower cost featur outweigh materi interest
TEXT:  International cooperation does have a role in migration policy, as we have seen in our examination of the Palermo Protocols and European readmission agreements, for example.

TEXT:  Advocates that care about these issues can take some lessons from our book. First, state interests are multidimensional, and each migration issue or problem may tap into a variety of interests, such as concern for human rights, demand for immigrant labor, and the protection of national security., LINE: 2468, BOOK: Migration Crises and the Struct, KEYWORD: advoc care issu take lesson book first state interest migrat issu problem may tap varieti interest concern human right demand immigr labor protect nation secur
TEXT:  Migration policy advocates should tap into the interests that appeal to states and link these to their particular policy goals.

TEXT:  On 19 September 2016, the UN General Assembly adopted the New York Declaration for Refugees and Migrants by consensus (UN 2016a, 2016b).

TEXT:  We find it unsurprising that the United Nations has adopted the New York Declaration unanimously. We have hypothesized that sending states (and poor countries that host large numbers of refugees) can take advantage of majoritarian international institutions to challenge the status quo and attempt to project their preferences onto the international stage., LINE: 2477, BOOK: Migration Crises and the Struct, KEYWORD: find unsurpris unit nation ha adopt new york declar unanim send state poor countri host larg number refuge take advantag intern institut challeng statu quo attempt project prefer onto intern stage
TEXT:  Receiving states, especially European receiving states, may also be amenable to international negotiations because of the high costs associated with the European “migrant crisis.” However, the declaration itself does not change the status quo of national sovereignty over entry, exit, and the treatment of migrants, as presented in our text., LINE: 2478, BOOK: Migration Crises and the Struct, KEYWORD: state especi state may also amen intern negoti high cost associ migrant crisi howev declar doe chang statu quo nation sovereignti entri exit treatment migrant text

TEXT:  If sending states are able to dominate the discussions, we suggest a global compact that reflects their preferences but that receiving states will not ratify. If, however, receiving states dominate the negotiations, the content is likely to reflect receiving state preferences for control and readmission, although sending states may be able to extract concessions on small numbers of regular admissions or other side payments., LINE: 2482, BOOK: Migration Crises and the Struct, KEYWORD: send state abl domin discuss suggest global compact prefer state ratifi howev state domin negoti content like reflect state prefer control readmiss although send state may abl extract concess small number regular admiss side payment
TEXT:  The third possible outcome would be prolonged negotiations that may or may not result in an agreement. We suggest the first and the third outcomes are more likely as the second would create regime maintenance costs for receiving states that likely would exceed the cost of negotiating a series of bilateral agreements that reflect each receiving state’s unique migration profile., LINE: 2483, BOOK: Migration Crises and the Struct, KEYWORD: third possibl outcom would negoti may may result agreement suggest first third outcom like second would creat regim mainten cost state like would exceed cost seri bilater agreement reflect state uniqu migrat profil

To understand the distinctions and protection responsibilities regarding asylum seekers in first asylum countries and in safe third countries, see European Commission (2016): “1) First country of asylum (Article 35 of the Asylum Procedures Directive): Where the person has been already recognized as a refugee in that country or otherwise enjoys sufficient protection there; 2) safe third country (Article 38 of the Asylum Procedures Directive): where the person has not already received protection in the third country but the third country can guarantee effective access to protection of the readmitted person., LINE: 2520, BOOK: Migration Crises and the Struct, KEYWORD: volum also evid support hypothesi propos rather descript volum chapter immigr understand distinct protect regard asylum seeker first asylum countri safe third countri see commiss first countri asylum articl asylum procedur direct person ha alreadi refuge countri otherwis suffici protect safe third countri articl asylum procedur direct person ha alreadi receiv protect third countri third countri guarante effect access protect person

TEXT:  Ellermann (2008) documents a case of a readmission agreement that was rejected by a local parliament. 15. A 1991 report to the European Council from the ministers responsible for immigration suggested that increasing cooperation on a wide range of economic, social, financial, and political issues, as well as assistance for addressing the root causes of migration, should be conditional on readmission agreements (Coleman 2009)., LINE: 2536, BOOK: Migration Crises and the Struct, KEYWORD: document case readmiss agreement wa local parliament report council minist respons immigr increas wide rang econom social financi polit issu well assist root caus migrat condit readmiss agreement

TEXT:  Nevertheless, in this case the substantive results from the Weibull model are very similar to those of the Cox model. We display the Cox results because the model has the fewest restrictions. 28.

TEXT:  In the case of GDP growth, the inflection in the direction of the relationship is at about t = 9, or nine years after the beginning of our analysis. GDP growth has a negative, albeit insignificant, effect on the probability of signing agreements at the beginning of our analysis and then, by 1989, the effect changes direction., LINE: 2549, BOOK: Migration Crises and the Struct, KEYWORD: case growth inflect direct relationship nine year begin analysi growth ha neg albeit insignific effect probabl agreement begin analysi effect chang direct
TEXT:  This means that somewhere around 1989, higher economic growth no longer reduces the likelihood that a receiving country will sign a readmission agreement; in fact, high growth rates begin to make it more likely that a country will sign an agreement., LINE: 2550, BOOK: Migration Crises and the Struct, KEYWORD: mean somewher around higher econom growth longer likelihood countri sign readmiss agreement fact high growth rate begin make like countri sign agreement
TEXT:  We suspect that this time-variant effect might be due to the broader patterns in the business cycle that our particular time frame captures.

TEXT:  30. Betts (2006) implies that states are motivated by their logistical inability to unilaterally prevent migrants from crossing their borders. For example, in the early 1990s, approximately one to two hundred thousand undocumented migrants were arriving each year to Europe from Northern African countries, and sixty-five thousand of these were sub-Saharan Africans in transit., LINE: 2554, BOOK: Migration Crises and the Struct, KEYWORD: state logist inabl unilater prevent migrant cross border exampl earli approxim one two hundr thousand undocu migrant year northern countri sixti five thousand sub transit
