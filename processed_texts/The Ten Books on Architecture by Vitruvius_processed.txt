TEXT: CONTENTS LIST OF ILLUSTRATIONS INDEXPREFACEDuring the last years of his life, Professor Morgan had devotedmuch time and energy to the preparation of a translation of Vitruvius, which he proposed to supplement with a revised text, illustrations, and notes. He had completed the translation, with the exception of the last four chapters of the tenth book, and had discussed, with Professor Warren, the illustrations intended for the first six books of the work; the notes had not been arranged or completed, though many of them were outlined in the manuscript, or the intention to insert them indicated. The several books of the translation, so far as it was completed, had been read to a little group of friends, consisting of Professors Sheldon and Kittredge, and myself, and had received our criticism, which had, at times, been utilized in the revision of the work., LINE: 2, BOOK: The Ten Books on Architecture by Vitruvius, KEYWORD: content list illustr last year life professor morgan time energi prepar translat supplement text illustr note translat except last four chapter tenth book professor warren illustr intend first six book work note though mani outlin manuscript intent insert sever book translat far wa read littl group friend professor receiv critic time revis work
TEXT: After the death of Professor Morgan, in spite of my obviousincompetency from a technical point of view, I undertook, at the request of his family, to complete the translation, and to see thebook through the press. I must, therefore, assume entire responsibility for the translation of the tenth book, beginning with chapter thirteen, and further responsibility for necessary changes made by me in the earlier part of the translation, changes which, in no case, affect any theory held by Professor Morgan, but which involve mainly the adoption of simpler forms of statement, or the correction of obvious oversights., LINE: 3, BOOK: The Ten Books on Architecture by Vitruvius, KEYWORD: death professor morgan spite technic point view undertook request famili complet translat see press must therefor assum entir respons translat tenth book begin chapter thirteen respons necessari chang made part translat chang case affect theori professor morgan involv mainli adopt simpler form statement correct obviou oversight

TEXT: The illustrations in the first six books are believed to besubstantially in accord with the wishes of Professor Morgan. The suggestions for illustrations in the later books were incomplete, and did not indicate, in all cases, with sufficient definiteness to allow them to be executed, the changes from conventional plans and designs intended by the translator. It has, therefore, been decided to include in this part of the work only those illustrations which are known to have had the full approval of Professor Morgan. The one exception to this principle is the reproduction of a rough model of the Ram of Hegetor, constructed by me on the basis of the measurements given by Vitruvius and Athenaeus., LINE: 5, BOOK: The Ten Books on Architecture by Vitruvius, KEYWORD: illustr first six book accord wish professor morgan suggest illustr later book incomplet indic case suffici definit allow execut chang convent plan design intend translat ha therefor decid includ part work illustr known full approv professor morgan one except principl reproduct rough model ram basi measur given
TEXT: It does not seem to me necessary or even advisable to enterinto a long discussion as to the date of Vitruvius, which has been assigned to various periods from the time of Augustus to the early centuries of our era. Professor Morgan, in several articles in the Harvard Studies in Classical Philology, and in the Proceedings of the American Academy, all of which have been, LINE: 6, BOOK: The Ten Books on Architecture by Vitruvius, KEYWORD: doe seem necessari even advis long discuss date ha assign variou period time earli centuri era professor morgan sever articl studi classic philolog proceed academi
TEXT: reprinted in a volume of Addresses and Essays (New York, 1909), upheld the now generally accepted view that Vitruvius wrote in the time of Augustus, and furnished conclusive evidence that nothing in his language is inconsistent with this view. In revising the translation, I met with one bit of evidence for a date before the end of the reign of Nero which I have never seen adduced. In viii, 3, 21, the kingdom of Cottius is mentioned, the name depending, it is true, on an emendation, but one which has been universally accepted since it was first proposed in 1513. The kingdom of Cottius was made into a Roman province by Nero (cf. Suetonius, Nero, 18), and it is inconceivable that any Roman writer subsequently referred to it as a kingdom., LINE: 7, BOOK: The Ten Books on Architecture by Vitruvius, KEYWORD: volum address essay new york upheld gener accept view wrote time furnish conclus evid noth languag inconsist view translat met one bit evid date end reign never seen kingdom name depend true emend one ha univers accept sinc wa first kingdom wa made provinc inconceiv writer subsequ kingdom
TEXT: It does seem necessary to add a few words about the literarymerits of Vitruvius in this treatise, and about Professor Morgan's views as to the general principles to be followed in the translation.Vitruvius was not a great literary personage, ambitious as he, LINE: 8, BOOK: The Ten Books on Architecture by Vitruvius, KEYWORD: doe seem necessari add word treatis professor morgan view gener principl translat wa great literari personag ambiti
TEXT: was to appear in that character. As Professor Morgan has aptly said, "he has all the marks of one unused to composition, to whom writing is a painful task." In his hand the measuring-rod was a far mightier implement than the pen. His turgid and pompous rhetoric displays itself in the introductions to the different books, where his exaggerated effort to introduce some semblance of style into his commonplace lectures on the noble principles which should govern the conduct of the architect, or into the prosaic lists of architects and writers on architecture, is everywhere apparent. Even in the more technical portions of his work, a like conscious effort may be detected, and, at the same time, a lack of confidence in his ability to express himself in, LINE: 9, BOOK: The Ten Books on Architecture by Vitruvius, KEYWORD: wa appear charact professor morgan ha aptli said ha mark one unus composit write pain task hand measur rod wa far implement pen turgid pompou rhetor display introduct differ book exagger effort introduc semblanc style commonplac lectur nobl principl govern conduct architect prosaic list architect writer architectur everywher appar even technic portion work like consciou effort may time lack confid abil express
TEXT: unmistakable language. He avoids periodic sentences, uses only the simpler subjunctive constructions, repeats the antecedent in relative clauses, and, not infrequently, adopts a formal language closely akin to that of specifications and contracts, the style with which he was, naturally, most familiar. He ends each book with a brief summary, almost a formula, somewhat like a sigh of relief, in which the reader unconsciously shares. At times his meaning is ambiguous, not because of grammatical faults, which are comparatively few and unimportant, but because, when he does attempt a periodic sentence, he becomes involved, and finds it difficult to extricate himself., LINE: 10, BOOK: The Ten Books on Architecture by Vitruvius, KEYWORD: unmistak languag period sentenc us simpler subjunct construct repeat anteced rel claus infrequ formal languag close akin specif contract style wa natur familiar end book brief summari almost formula somewhat like sigh relief reader unconsci share time mean ambigu grammat fault compar unimport doe attempt period sentenc becom involv find difficult extric
TEXT: Some of these peculiarities and crudities of expressionProfessor Morgan purposely imitated, because of his conviction that a translation should not merely reproduce the substance of a book, but should also give as clear a picture as possible of the original, of its author, and of the working of his mind. The translation is intended, then, to be faithful and exact, but it deliberately avoids any attempt to treat the language of Vitruvius as though it were Ciceronian, or to give a false impression of conspicuous literary merit in a work which is destitute of that quality. The translator had, however, the utmost confidence in the sincerity of Vitruvius and in the serious purpose of his treatise on architecture., LINE: 11, BOOK: The Ten Books on Architecture by Vitruvius, KEYWORD: peculiar cruditi morgan purpos convict translat mere reproduc substanc book also give clear pictur possibl origin author work mind translat intend faith exact deliber attempt treat languag though give fals impress conspicu literari merit work destitut qualiti translat howev utmost confid sincer seriou purpos treatis architectur

While your divine intelligence and will, Imperator Caesar,were engaged in acquiring the right to command the world, and while your fellow citizens, when all their enemies had been laid low by your invincible valour, were glorying in your triumph and victory,—while all foreign nations were in subjection awaiting your beck and call, and the Roman people and senate, released from their alarm, were beginning to be guided by your most noble conceptions and policies, I hardly dared, in view of your serious employments, to publish my writings and long considered ideas on architecture, for fear of subjecting myself to your displeasure by an unseasonable interruption., LINE: 40, BOOK: The Ten Books on Architecture by Vitruvius, KEYWORD: ram tortois sixteenth centuri model divin intellig imper engag right command world fellow citizen enemi laid low invinc glori triumph victori foreign nation subject beck call peopl senat alarm begin nobl concept polici hardli view seriou employ publish write long consid idea architectur fear displeasur unseason interrupt

After the council of heaven gave him a place in the dwellings of immortal life and transferred your father's power to your hands, my devotion continuing unchanged as I remembered him inclined me to support you. And so with Marcus Aurelius, Publius Minidius, and Gnaeus Cornelius, I was ready to supply and repair ballistae, scorpiones, and other artillery, and I have received rewards for good service with them.

TEXT: CHAPTER ITHE EDUCATION OF THE ARCHITECT1. The architect should be equipped with knowledge of manybranches of study and varied kinds of learning, for it is by his judgement that all work done by the other arts is put to test. This knowledge is the child of practice and theory. Practice is the continuous and regular exercise of employment where manual work is done with any necessary material according to the design of a drawing. Theory, on the other hand, is the ability to demonstrate and explain the productions of dexterity on the principles of proportion., LINE: 44, BOOK: The Ten Books on Architecture by Vitruvius, KEYWORD: chapter educ architect architect knowledg studi vari kind learn work done art put test knowledg child practic theori practic continu regular exercis employ manual work done necessari materi accord design draw theori hand abil demonstr explain product dexter principl proport
TEXT: 2. It follows, therefore, that architects who have aimed atacquiring manual skill without scholarship have never been able to reach a position of authority to correspond to their pains, while those who relied only upon theories and scholarship were obviously hunting the shadow, not the substance. But those who have a thorough knowledge of both, like men armed at all points, have the sooner attained their object and carried authority with them., LINE: 45, BOOK: The Ten Books on Architecture by Vitruvius, KEYWORD: therefor architect manual skill without scholarship never abl reach posit author correspond pain upon theori scholarship obvious hunt shadow substanc thorough knowledg like men arm point sooner object carri author
TEXT: 3. In all matters, but particularly in architecture, there are thesetwo points:—the thing signified, and that which gives it its significance. That which is signified is the subject of which we may be speaking; and that which gives significance is a demonstration on scientific principles. It appears, then, that one who professes himself an architect should be well versed in both, LINE: 46, BOOK: The Ten Books on Architecture by Vitruvius, KEYWORD: matter particularli architectur point thing give signific subject may speak give signific demonstr scientif principl one architect well vers
TEXT: directions. He ought, therefore, to be both naturally gifted and amenable to instruction. Neither natural ability without instruction nor instruction without natural ability can make the perfect artist. Let him be educated, skilful with the pencil, instructed in geometry, know much history, have followed the philosophers with attention, understand music, have some knowledge of medicine, know the opinions of the jurists, and be acquainted with astronomy and the theory of the heavens., LINE: 47, BOOK: The Ten Books on Architecture by Vitruvius, KEYWORD: direct ought therefor natur gift amen instruct neither natur abil without instruct instruct without natur abil make perfect artist let educ pencil instruct geometri know much histori philosoph attent understand music knowledg medicin know opinion jurist acquaint astronomi theori heaven
TEXT: 4. The reasons for all this are as follows. An architect ought tobe an educated man so as to leave a more lasting remembrance in his treatises. Secondly, he must have a knowledge of drawing so that he can readily make sketches to show the appearance of the work which he proposes. Geometry, also, is of much assistance in architecture, and in particular it teaches us the use of the rule and compasses, by which especially we acquire readiness in making plans for buildings in their grounds, and rightly apply the square, the level, and the plummet. By means of optics, again, the light in buildings can be drawn from fixed quarters of the sky. It is true that it is by arithmetic that the total cost of buildings is calculated and measurements are computed, but difficult questions involving symmetry are solved by means of geometrical theories and methods., LINE: 48, BOOK: The Ten Books on Architecture by Vitruvius, KEYWORD: reason architect ought tobe educ man leav last remembr treatis secondli must knowledg draw readili make sketch show appear work geometri also much assist architectur particular teach use rule compass especi acquir readi make plan build ground rightli appli squar level plummet mean optic light build drawn fix quarter sky true arithmet total cost build calcul measur difficult question symmetri mean geometr theori method
TEXT: 5. A wide knowledge of history is requisite because, amongthe ornamental parts of an architect's design for a work, there are many the underlying idea of whose employment he should be able to explain toGree inquirers. For instance, suppose him to set up the marble statues of women in long robes, called Caryatides, to take the place of columns, with the mutules and coronas placed directly above their heads, he will give the following explanation to his questioners. Caryae, a state in, LINE: 49, BOOK: The Ten Books on Architecture by Vitruvius, KEYWORD: wide knowledg histori requisit ornament part architect design work mani underli idea whose employ abl explain inquir instanc suppos set marbl statu woman long robe take place column corona directli head give follow explan question state
TEXT: Peloponnesus, sided with the Persian enemies against Greece; later the Greeks, having gloriously won their freedom by victory in the war, made common cause and declared war against the people of Caryae. They took the town, killed the men, abandoned the State to desolation, and carried off their wives into slavery, without permitting them, however, to lay aside the long robes and other marks of their rank as married women, so that they might be obliged not only to march in the triumph but to appear forever after as a type of slavery, burdened with the weight of their shame and so making atonement for their State. Hence, the architects of the time designed for public buildings statues of these women, placed so as to carry a load, in order that the sin and the punishment of the people of Caryae might be known and handed down even to posterity., LINE: 50, BOOK: The Ten Books on Architecture by Vitruvius, KEYWORD: side enemi later glorious freedom victori war made common caus declar war peopl took town men abandon state desol carri wife slaveri without howev lay asid long robe mark rank marri woman might oblig march triumph appear forev type slaveri weight shame make aton state henc architect time design public build statu woman carri load order sin punish peopl might known hand even poster
TEXT: 6. Likewise the Lacedaemonians under the leadership of Pausanias, son of Agesipolis, after conquering the Persian armies, infinite in number, with a small force at the battle of Plataea, celebrated a glorious triumph with the spoils and booty, and with the money obtained from the sale thereof built the Persian Porch, to be a monument to the renown and valour of the people and a trophy of victory for posterity.

As for philosophy, it makes an architect high-minded andnot self-assuming, but rather renders him courteous, just, and honest without avariciousness. This is very important, for no work can be rightly done without honesty and incorruptibility.

Therefore, if among artists working each in a single field not all, but only a few in an entire generation acquire fame, and that with difficulty, how can an architect, who has to be skilful in many arts, accomplish not merely the feat—in itself a great marvel—of being deficient in none of them, but also that of surpassing all those artists who have devoted themselves with unremitting industry to single fields?, LINE: 69, BOOK: The Ten Books on Architecture by Vitruvius, KEYWORD: still architect alon cannot perfect even men individu specialti art attain highest point merit therefor among artist work singl field entir gener acquir fame difficulti architect ha mani art accomplish mere feat great marvel defici none also surpass artist devot unremit industri singl field
TEXT: 15. It appears, then, that Pytheos made a mistake by notobserving that the arts are each composed of two things, the actual work and the theory of it. One of these, the doing of the work, is proper to men trained in the individual subject, while the other, the theory, is common to all scholars: for example, to physicians and musicians the rhythmical beat of the pulse and its metrical movement. But if there is a wound to be healed or a sick man to be saved from danger, the musician will not call, for the business will be appropriate to the physician. So in the case of a musical instrument, not the physician but the musician will be the man to tune it so that the ears may find their due pleasure in its strains., LINE: 70, BOOK: The Ten Books on Architecture by Vitruvius, KEYWORD: made mistak art compos two thing actual work theori one work proper men train individu subject theori common scholar exampl physician musician rhythmic beat puls metric movement wound sick man save danger musician call busi appropri physician case music instrument physician musician man tune ear may find due pleasur strain

It appears, therefore, that he has done enough and to spare who in each subject possesses a fairly good knowledge of those parts, with their principles, which are indispensable for architecture, so that if he is required to pass judgement and to express approval in the case of those things or arts, he may not be found wanting., LINE: 72, BOOK: The Ten Books on Architecture by Vitruvius, KEYWORD: special train deal singl art therefor ha done enough spare subject fairli good knowledg part principl indispens architectur express approv case thing art may found want

TEXT: CHAPTER IITHE FUNDAMENTAL PRINCIPLES OF ARCHITECTURE1. Architecture depends on Order (in Greek τἁξις),Arrangement (in Greek διἁθεσις), Eurythmy, Symmetry, Propriety, and Economy (in Greek οἱκονομἱα).2. Order gives due measure to the members of a work, LINE: 78, BOOK: The Ten Books on Architecture by Vitruvius, KEYWORD: chapter fundament principl architectur architectur order arrang eurythmi symmetri proprieti economi order give due measur member work
TEXT: considered separately, and symmetrical agreement to the proportions of the whole. It is an adjustment according to quantity (in Greek ποσὁτης). By this I mean the selection of modules from the members of the work itself and, starting from these individual parts of members, constructing the whole work to correspond. Arrangement includes the putting of things in their proper places and the elegance of effect which is due to adjustments appropriate to the character of the work. Its forms of expression (Greek ἱδἑαι) are these: groundplan, elevation, and perspective. A groundplan is made by the proper successive use of compasses and rule, through which we get outlines for the plane surfaces of buildings. An elevation is a picture of the front of a building, set upright and properly drawn in the proportions of the contemplated work. Perspective is the method of, LINE: 79, BOOK: The Ten Books on Architecture by Vitruvius, KEYWORD: consid separ symmetr agreement proport whole adjust accord quantiti mean select modul member work start individu part member whole work correspond arrang thing proper place eleg effect due adjust appropri charact work form express elev perspect made proper success use compass rule get outlin plane surfac build elev pictur front build set upright properli drawn proport work perspect method
TEXT: sketching a front with the sides withdrawing into the background, the lines all meeting in the centre of a circle. All three come of reflexion and invention. Reflexion is careful and laborious thought, and watchful attention directed to the agreeable effect of one's plan. Invention, on the other hand, is the solving of intricate problems and the discovery of new principles by means of brilliancy and versatility. These are the departments belonging under Arrangement., LINE: 80, BOOK: The Ten Books on Architecture by Vitruvius, KEYWORD: sketch front side withdraw background line meet circl three come invent care labori thought watch attent direct agreeabl effect one plan invent hand intric problem discoveri new principl mean brillianc versatil depart belong arrang
TEXT: 3. Eurythmy is beauty and fitness in the adjustments of themembers. This is found when the members of a work are of a height suited to their breadth, of a breadth suited to their length, and, in a word, when they all correspond symmetrically., LINE: 81, BOOK: The Ten Books on Architecture by Vitruvius, KEYWORD: eurythmi beauti fit adjust found member work height breadth breadth length word correspond symmetr
TEXT: 4. Symmetry is a proper agreement between the members ofthe work itself, and relation between the different parts and the whole general scheme, in accordance with a certain part selected as standard. Thus in the human body there is a kind of symmetrical harmony between forearm, foot, palm, finger, and other small parts; and so it is with perfect buildings. In the case of temples, symmetry may be calculated from the thickness of a column, from a triglyph, or even from a module; in the ballista, from the hole or from what the Greeks call the περἱτρητος; in a ship, from the space between the tholepins διἁπηγμἁ; and in other things, from various members., LINE: 82, BOOK: The Ten Books on Architecture by Vitruvius, KEYWORD: symmetri proper agreement member work relat differ part whole gener scheme accord certain part select standard thu human bodi kind symmetr harmoni forearm foot palm finger small part perfect build case templ symmetri may calcul thick column triglyph even modul ballista hole call ship space tholepin thing variou member
TEXT: 5. Propriety is that perfection of style which comes when awork is authoritatively constructed on approved principles. It arises from prescription (Greek: θεματισμὡ), from usage, or from nature. From prescription, in the case of hypaethral edifices, open to the sky, in honour of Jupiter Lightning, the Heaven, the Sun, or the Moon: for these are gods whose, LINE: 83, BOOK: The Ten Books on Architecture by Vitruvius, KEYWORD: proprieti perfect style come awork authorit principl prescript usag natur prescript case hypaethr edific open sky lightn heaven sun moon god whose
TEXT: semblances and manifestations we behold before our very eyes in the sky when it is cloudless and bright. The temples of Minerva, Mars, and Hercules, will be Doric, since the virile strength of these gods makes daintiness entirely inappropriate to their houses. In temples to Venus, Flora, Proserpine, Spring- Water, and the Nymphs, the Corinthian order will be found to have peculiar significance, because these are delicate divinities and so its rather slender outlines, its flowers, leaves, and ornamental volutes will lend propriety where it is due. The construction of temples of the Ionic order to Juno, Diana, Father Bacchus, and the other gods of that kind, will be in keeping with the middle position which they hold; for the building of such will be an appropriate combination of the severity of the Doric and the delicacy of the Corinthian., LINE: 84, BOOK: The Ten Books on Architecture by Vitruvius, KEYWORD: semblanc manifest behold eye sky cloudless bright templ mar sinc viril strength god make dainti entir inappropri hous templ flora spring water nymph order found peculiar signific delic divin rather slender outlin flower leaf ornament volut lend proprieti due construct templ ionic order father god kind keep middl posit hold build appropri combin sever delicaci
TEXT: 6. Propriety arises from usage when buildings havingmagnificent interiors are provided with elegant entrance-courts to correspond; for there will be no propriety in the spectacle of an elegant interior approached by a low, mean entrance. Or, if dentils be carved in the cornice of the Doric entablature or triglyphs represented in the Ionic entablature over the cushion- shaped capitals of the columns, the effect will be spoilt by the transfer of the peculiarities of the one order of building to the other, the usage in each class having been fixed long ago., LINE: 85, BOOK: The Ten Books on Architecture by Vitruvius, KEYWORD: proprieti usag build interior provid eleg entranc court correspond proprieti spectacl eleg interior low mean entranc cornic entablatur ionic entablatur cushion shape capit column effect spoilt transfer peculiar one order build usag class fix long ago
TEXT: 7. Finally, propriety will be due to natural causes if, forexample, in the case of all sacred precincts we select very healthy neighbourhoods with suitable springs of water in the places where the fanes are to be built, particularly in the case of those to Aesculapius and to Health, gods by whose healing powers great numbers of the sick are apparently cured. For when their diseased bodies are transferred from an unhealthy to, LINE: 86, BOOK: The Ten Books on Architecture by Vitruvius, KEYWORD: final proprieti due natur caus case sacr precinct select healthi suitabl spring water place built particularli case health god whose heal power great number sick appar diseas bodi transfer unhealthi
TEXT: a healthy spot, and treated with waters from health-giving springs, they will the more speedily grow well. The result will be that the divinity will stand in higher esteem and find his dignity increased, all owing to the nature of his site. There will also be natural propriety in using an eastern light for bedrooms and libraries, a western light in winter for baths and winter apartments, and a northern light for picture galleries and other places in which a steady light is needed; for that quarter of the sky grows neither light nor dark with the course of the sun, but remains steady and unshifting all day long., LINE: 87, BOOK: The Ten Books on Architecture by Vitruvius, KEYWORD: healthi spot water health give spring speedili grow well result divin stand higher esteem find digniti owe natur site also natur proprieti eastern light bedroom librari western light winter bath winter apart northern light pictur galleri place steadi light quarter sky neither light dark cours sun remain steadi unshift day long
TEXT: 8. Economy denotes the proper management of materials andof site, as well as a thrifty balancing of cost and common sense in the construction of works. This will be observed if, in the first place, the architect does not demand things which cannot be found or made ready without great expense. For example: it is not everywhere that there is plenty of pitsand, rubble, fir, clear fir, and marble, since they are produced in different places and to assemble them is difficult and costly. Where there is no pitsand, we must use the kinds washed up by rivers or by the sea; the lack of fir and clear fir may be evaded by using cypress, poplar, elm, or pine; and other problems we must solve in similar ways., LINE: 88, BOOK: The Ten Books on Architecture by Vitruvius, KEYWORD: economi proper manag materi site well thrifti balanc cost common sens construct work first place architect doe demand thing cannot found made readi without great expens exampl everywher plenti rubbl fir clear fir marbl sinc produc differ place assembl difficult costli must use kind wash river sea lack fir clear fir may cypress poplar elm pine problem must solv similar way
TEXT: 9. A second stage in Economy is reached when we have toplan the different kinds of dwellings suitable for ordinary householders, for great wealth, or for the high position of the statesman.

TEXT: 1. There are three departments of architecture: the art ofbuilding, the making of timepieces, and the construction of machinery. Building is, in its turn, divided into two parts, of which the first is the construction of fortified towns and of works for general use in public places, and the second is the putting up of structures for private individuals. There are three classes of public buildings: the first for defensive, the second for religious, and the third for utilitarian purposes. Under defence comes the planning of walls, towers, and gates, permanent devices for resistance against hostile attacks; under religion, the erection of fanes and temples to the immortal gods; under utility, the provision of meeting places for public use, such as harbours, markets, colonnades, baths, theatres, promenades, and all other similar arrangements in public places., LINE: 91, BOOK: The Ten Books on Architecture by Vitruvius, KEYWORD: three depart architectur art make timepiec construct machineri build turn divid two part first construct town work gener use public place second structur privat individu three class public build first defens second religi third utilitarian purpos defenc come wall tower gate perman devic resist hostil attack religion erect templ immort god util provis meet place public use harbour market colonnad bath promenad similar arrang public place

TEXT: CHAPTER IVTHE SITE OF A CITY1. For fortified towns the following general principles are to beobserved. First comes the choice of a very healthy site. Such a site will be high, neither misty nor frosty, and in a climate neither hot nor cold, but temperate; further, without marshes in the neighbourhood. For when the morning breezes blow toward the town at sunrise, if they bring with them mists from marshes and, mingled with the mist, the poisonous breath of the creatures of the marshes to be wafted into the bodies of the inhabitants, they will make the site unhealthy. Again, if the town is on the coast with a southern or western exposure, it will not be healthy, because in summer the southern sky grows hot at sunrise and is fiery at noon, while a western exposure grows warm after sunrise, is hot at noon, and at evening all aglow., LINE: 94, BOOK: The Ten Books on Architecture by Vitruvius, KEYWORD: chapter site citi town follow gener principl first come choic healthi site site high neither misti frosti climat neither hot cold temper without marsh morn breez blow toward town sunris bring mist marsh mist poison breath creatur marsh bodi inhabit make site unhealthi town coast southern western exposur healthi summer southern sky hot sunris fieri noon western exposur warm sunris hot noon even aglow
TEXT: 2. These variations in heat and the subsequent cooling off areharmful to the people living on such sites. The same conclusion may be reached in the case of inanimate things. For instance, nobody draws the light for covered wine rooms from the south or west, but rather from the north, since that quarter is never subject to change but is always constant and unshifting. So it is with granaries: grain exposed to the sun's course soon loses its, LINE: 95, BOOK: The Ten Books on Architecture by Vitruvius, KEYWORD: variat heat subsequ cool peopl live site conclus may case inanim thing instanc nobodi draw light cover wine room south west rather north sinc quarter never subject chang alway constant unshift granari grain expos sun cours soon
TEXT: good quality, and provisions and fruit, unless stored in a place unexposed to the sun's course, do not keep long.3. For heat is a universal solvent, melting out of things theirpower of resistance, and sucking away and removing their natural strength with its fiery exhalations so that they grow soft, and hence weak, under its glow. We see this in the case of iron which, however hard it may naturally be, yet when heated thoroughly in a furnace fire can be easily worked into any kind of shape, and still, if cooled while it is soft and white hot, it hardens again with a mere dip into cold water and takes on its former quality., LINE: 96, BOOK: The Ten Books on Architecture by Vitruvius, KEYWORD: good qualiti provis fruit unless place unexpos sun cours keep long heat univers solvent melt thing resist suck away remov natur strength fieri exhal grow soft henc weak glow see case iron howev hard may natur yet thoroughli furnac fire easili work kind shape still soft white hot mere dip cold water take former qualiti
TEXT: 4. We may also recognize the truth of this from the fact that insummer the heat makes everybody weak, not only in unhealthy but even in healthy places, and that in winter even the most unhealthy districts are much healthier because they are given a solidity by the cooling off. Similarly, persons removed from cold countries to hot cannot endure it but waste away; whereas those who pass from hot places to the cold regions of the north, not only do not suffer in health from the change of residence but even gain by it., LINE: 97, BOOK: The Ten Books on Architecture by Vitruvius, KEYWORD: may also recogn truth fact heat make everybodi weak unhealthi even healthi place winter even unhealthi district much given solid cool similarli person remov cold countri hot cannot endur wast away wherea hot place cold region north suffer health chang resid even gain
TEXT: 5. It appears, then, that in founding towns we must beware ofdistricts from which hot winds can spread abroad over the inhabitants. For while all bodies are composed of the four elements (in Greek στοιχεἱα), that is, of heat, moisture, the earthy, and air, yet there are mixtures according to natural temperament which make up the natures of all the different animals of the world, each after its kind., LINE: 98, BOOK: The Ten Books on Architecture by Vitruvius, KEYWORD: found town must bewar hot wind spread abroad inhabit bodi compos four element heat moistur earthi air yet mixtur accord natur tempera make natur differ anim world kind
TEXT: 6. Therefore, if one of these elements, heat, becomespredominant in any body whatsoever, it destroys and dissolvesall the others with its violence. This defect may be due to violent heat from certain quarters of the sky, pouring into the open pores in too great proportion to admit of a mixture suited to the natural temperament of the body in question. Again, if too much moisture enters the channels of a body, and thus introduces disproportion, the other elements, adulterated by the liquid, are impaired, and the virtues of the mixture dissolved. This defect, in turn, may arise from the cooling properties of moist winds and breezes blowing upon the body. In the same way, increase or diminution of the proportion of air or of the earthy which is natural to the body may enfeeble the other elements; the predominance of the earthy being due to overmuch food, that of air to a heavy atmosphere., LINE: 99, BOOK: The Ten Books on Architecture by Vitruvius, KEYWORD: therefor one element heat bodi whatsoev violenc defect may due violent heat certain quarter sky pour open pore great proport admit mixtur natur tempera bodi question much moistur channel bodi thu disproport element liquid virtu mixtur defect turn may aris cool properti moist wind breez blow upon bodi way increas diminut proport air earthi natur bodi may enfeebl element predomin earthi due overmuch food air heavi atmospher

TEXT: 9. I cannot too strongly insist upon the need of a return to themethod of old times. Our ancestors, when about to build a town or an army post, sacrificed some of the cattle that were wont to feed on the site proposed and examined their livers. If the livers of the first victims were dark-coloured or abnormal, they sacrificed others, to see whether the fault was due to disease or their food. They never began to build defensive works in a place until after they had made many such trials and satisfied themselves that good water and food had made the liver sound and firm. If they continued to find it abnormal, they argued from this that the food and water supply found in such a place would be just as unhealthy for man, and so they moved away and changed to another neighbourhood, healthfulness being their chief object., LINE: 105, BOOK: The Ten Books on Architecture by Vitruvius, KEYWORD: cannot strongli insist upon need return old time ancestor build town armi post cattl wont feed site liver liver first victim dark abnorm see whether fault wa due diseas food never build defens work place made mani trial satisfi good water food made liver sound firm continu find abnorm food water suppli found place would unhealthi man away anoth health chief object

If the walled town is built among the marshes themselves,provided they are by the sea, with a northern or north-eastern exposure, and are above the level of the seashore, the site will be reasonable enough. For ditches can be dug to let out the water to the shore, and also in times of storms the sea swells and comes backing up into the marshes, where its bitter blend prevents the reproductions of the usual marsh creatures, while any that swim down from the higher levels to the shore are killed at once by the saltness to which they are unused. An instance of this may be found in the Gallic marshes surrounding Altino, Ravenna, Aquileia, and other towns in places of the kind, close by marshes.

After insuring on these principles the healthfulness of thefuture city, and selecting a neighbourhood that can supply plenty of food stuffs to maintain the community, with good roads or else convenient rivers or seaports affording easy means of transport to the city, the next thing to do is to lay the foundations for the towers and walls. Dig down to solid bottom, if it can be found, and lay them therein, going as deep as the magnitude of the proposed work seems to require. They should be much thicker than the part of the walls that will appear above ground, and their structure should be as solid as it can possibly be laid., LINE: 111, BOOK: The Ten Books on Architecture by Vitruvius, KEYWORD: chapter citi wall principl health citi suppli plenti food stuff maintain commun good road els conveni river seaport easi mean transport citi next thing lay foundat tower wall dig solid bottom found lay therein go deep magnitud work requir much part wall appear ground structur solid possibl laid

In the thickness there should be set a very close succession of ties made of charred olive wood, binding the two faces of the wall together like pins, to give it lasting endurance. For that is a material which neither decay, nor the weather, nor time can harm, but even though buried in the earth or set in the water it keeps sound and useful forever. And so not only city walls but substructures in general and all walls that require a thickness like that of a city wall, will be long in falling to decay if tied in this manner., LINE: 114, BOOK: The Ten Books on Architecture by Vitruvius, KEYWORD: thick wall opinion arm men meet top may one anoth without interfer thick set close success tie made oliv wood bind two face wall togeth like pin give last endur materi neither decay weather time harm even though buri earth set water keep sound use forev citi wall substructur gener wall requir thick like citi wall long fall decay tie manner

The towers should be set at intervals of not more than abowshot apart, so that in case of an assault upon any one of them, the enemy may be repulsed with scorpiones and other means of hurling missiles from the towers to the right and left. Opposite the inner side of every tower the wall should be interrupted for a space the width of the tower, and have only a wooden flooring across, leading to the interior of the tower but not firmly nailed. This is to be cut away by the defenders in case the enemy gets possession of any portion of the wall; and if the work is quickly done, the enemy will not be able to make his way to the other towers and the rest of the wall unless he is ready to face a fall., LINE: 115, BOOK: The Ten Books on Architecture by Vitruvius, KEYWORD: tower set interv apart case assault upon one enemi may mean hurl missil tower right left opposit inner side everi tower wall interrupt space width tower wooden floor across lead interior tower firmli cut away defend case enemi get possess portion wall work quickli done enemi abl make way tower rest wall unless readi face fall

The towers themselves must be either round or polygonal.Square towers are sooner shattered by military engines, for the battering rams pound their angles to pieces; but in the case of round towers they can do no harm, being engaged, as it were, in driving wedges to their centre.

The rampart form of defence, however, is not required in allplaces, but only where outside the wall there is high ground from which an assault on the fortifications may be made over a level space lying between.

That this is the fact we may learn from bronze eolipiles, and thus by means of a scientific invention discover a divine truth lurking in the laws of the heavens. Eolipiles are hollow bronze balls, with a very small opening through which water is poured into them. Set before a fire, not a breath issues from them before they get warm; but as soon as they begin to boil, out comes a strong blast due to the fire. Thus from this slight and very short experiment we may understand and judge of the mighty and wonderful laws of the heavens and the nature of winds., LINE: 122, BOOK: The Ten Books on Architecture by Vitruvius, KEYWORD: wind flow wave air move hither produc heat meet moistur rush heat gener mighti current air fact may learn bronz thu mean scientif invent discov divin truth law heaven hollow bronz ball small open water set fire breath issu get warm soon begin boil come strong blast due fire thu slight short experi may understand judg mighti wonder law heaven natur wind

But more careful investigators tell us that there are eight. Chief among such was Andronicus of Cyrrhus who in proof built the marble octagonal tower in Athens. On the several sides of the octagon he executed reliefs representing the several winds, each facing the point from which it blows; and on top of the tower he set a conical shaped piece of marble and on this a bronze Triton with a rod outstretched in its right hand. It was so contrived as to go round with the wind, always stopping to face the breeze and holding its rod as a pointer directly over the representation of the wind that was blowing., LINE: 125, BOOK: The Ten Books on Architecture by Vitruvius, KEYWORD: four wind due east south due west north care investig tell eight chief among wa proof built marbl octagon tower sever side octagon execut relief sever wind face point blow top tower set conic shape piec marbl bronz triton rod right hand wa round wind alway stop face breez hold rod pointer directli represent wind wa blow

Then, opening your compasses to this point which marks the length of the gnomon's shadow, describe a circle from the centre.

TEXT: CHAPTER ITHE ORIGIN OF THE DWELLING HOUSE1. The men of old were born like the wild beasts, in woods,caves, and groves, and lived on savage fare. As time went on, the thickly crowded trees in a certain place, tossed by storms and winds, and rubbing their branches against one another, caught fire, and so the inhabitants of the place were put to flight, being terrified by the furious flame. After it subsided, they drew near, and observing that they were very comfortable standing before the warm fire, they put on logs and, while thus keeping it alive, brought up other people to it, showing them by signs how much comfort they got from it. In that gathering of men, at a time when utterance of sound was purely individual, from daily habits they fixed upon articulate words just as these had happened to come; then, from indicating by name things in common use, the result was that in this chance way they began to talk, and thus originated conversation with one another., LINE: 166, BOOK: The Ten Books on Architecture by Vitruvius, KEYWORD: chapter origin dwell hous men old born like wild beast wood cave grove live savag fare time went thickli crowd tree certain place storm wind rub branch one anoth caught fire inhabit place put flight furiou flame drew near observ comfort stand warm fire put log thu keep aliv brought peopl show sign much comfort got gather men time utter sound wa pure individu daili habit fix upon articul word come name thing common use result wa chanc way talk thu convers one anoth

And since they were of an imitative and teachable nature,they would daily point out to each other the results of their building, boasting of the novelties in it; and thus, with their natural gifts sharpened by emulation, their standards improved daily. At first they set up forked stakes connected by twigs and covered these walls with mud. Others made walls of lumps of dried mud, covering them with reeds and leaves to keep out the rain and the heat. Finding that such roofs could not stand the rain during the storms of winter, they built them with peaks daubed with mud, the roofs sloping and projecting so as to carry off the rain water., LINE: 169, BOOK: The Ten Books on Architecture by Vitruvius, KEYWORD: sinc imit teachabl natur would daili point result build boast novelti thu natur gift emul standard daili first set fork stake connect twig cover wall mud made wall lump dri mud cover reed leaf keep rain heat find roof could stand rain storm winter built peak mud roof slope project carri rain water

That houses originated as I have written above, we can seefor ourselves from the buildings that are to this day constructed of like materials by foreign tribes: for instance, in Gaul, Spain, Portugal, and Aquitaine, roofed with oak shingles or thatched. Among the Colchians in Pontus, where there are forests in plenty, they lay down entire trees flat on the ground to the right and the left, leaving between them a space to suit the length of the trees, and then place above these another pair of trees, resting on the ends of the former and at right angles with them. These four trees enclose the space for the dwelling.

For there is no kind of material, no body, and no thing that can be produced or conceived of, which is not made up of elementary particles; and nature does not admit of a truthful exploration in accordance with the doctrines of the physicists without an accurate demonstration of the primary causes of things, showing how and why they are as they are., LINE: 182, BOOK: The Ten Books on Architecture by Vitruvius, KEYWORD: book therefor proper order place return subject regard construct build consid natur format proport elementari constitu combin make clear obscur reader kind materi bodi thing produc made elementari particl natur doe admit truth explor accord doctrin physicist without accur demonstr primari caus thing show

TEXT: cannot be cut up," or, by some, "indivisibles." The school of the Pythagoreans added air and the earthy to the water and fire. Hence, although Democritus did not in a strict sense name them, but spoke only of indivisible bodies, yet he seems to have meant these same elements, because when taken by themselves they cannot be harmed, nor are they susceptible of dissolution, nor can they be cut up into parts, but throughout time eternal they forever retain an infinite solidity., LINE: 184, BOOK: The Ten Books on Architecture by Vitruvius, KEYWORD: cannot cut school ad air earthi water fire henc although strict sens name spoke indivis bodi yet meant element taken cannot suscept dissolut cut part throughout time etern forev retain infinit solid

They should not be made of sandy or pebbly clay, or of fine gravel, because when made of these kinds they are in the first place heavy; and, secondly, when washed by the rain as they stand in walls, they go to pieces and break up, and the straw in them does not hold together on account of the roughness of the material.

TEXT: may dry uniformly. Those made in Summer are defective, because the fierce heat of the sun bakes their surface and makes the brick seem dry while inside it is not dry. And so the shrinking, which follows as they dry, causes cracks in the parts which were dried before, and these cracks make the bricks weak., LINE: 188, BOOK: The Ten Books on Architecture by Vitruvius, KEYWORD: may dri uniformli made summer defect fierc heat sun surfac make brick seem dri insid dri shrink dri caus crack part dri crack make brick weak
TEXT:  Bricks will be most serviceable if made two years before using; for they cannot dry thoroughly in less time. When fresh undried bricks are used in a wall, the stucco covering stiffens and hardens into a permanent mass, but the bricks settle and cannot keep the same height as the stucco; the motion caused by their shrinking prevents them from adhering to it, and they are separated from their union with it., LINE: 189, BOOK: The Ten Books on Architecture by Vitruvius, KEYWORD: brick servic made two year cannot dri thoroughli less time fresh undri brick use wall stucco cover perman mass brick settl cannot keep height stucco motion shrink union

When these areused in a wall, a course of bricks is laid on one face and a course of half-bricks on the other, and they are bedded to the line on each face. The walls are bonded by alternate courses of the two different kinds, and as the bricks are always laid so as to break joints, this lends strength and a not unattractive appearance to both sides of such walls., LINE: 193, BOOK: The Ten Books on Architecture by Vitruvius, KEYWORD: one four palm squar public build privat brick also half brick wall cours brick laid one face cours half brick bed line face wall bond altern cours two differ kind brick alway laid break joint strength unattract appear side wall
TEXT: VITRUVIUS' BRICK-BOND ACCORDING TO REBERIn the states of Maxilua and Callet, in Further Spain, as well asin Pitane in Asia Minor, there are bricks which, when finished and dried, will float on being thrown into water. The reason why they can float seems to be that the clay of which they are made is like pumice-stone. So it is light, and also it does not, after being hardened by exposure to the air, take up or absorb liquid. So these bricks, being of this light and porous quality, and admitting no moisture into their texture, must by the laws of nature float in water, like pumice, no matter what their weight may be. They have therefore great advantages; for they are not heavy to use in building and, once made, they are not spoiled by bad weather., LINE: 194, BOOK: The Ten Books on Architecture by Vitruvius, KEYWORD: brick bond accord state callet well minor brick finish dri float thrown water reason float clay made like pumic stone light also doe exposur air take absorb liquid brick light porou qualiti moistur textur must law natur float water like pumic matter weight may therefor great advantag heavi use build made spoil bad weather

The kinds of pitsand are these: black, gray, red, and carbuncular. Of these the best will be found to be that which crackles when rubbed in the hand, while that which has much dirt in it will not be sharp enough.

This kind, however, has these defects when used in masonry: it dries slowly; the wall cannot be built up without interruption but from time to time there must be pauses in the work; and such a wall cannot carry vaultings. Furthermore, when sea-sand is used in walls and these are coated with stucco, a salty efflorescence is given out which spoils the surface., LINE: 196, BOOK: The Ten Books on Architecture by Vitruvius, KEYWORD: dug must sift river bed gravel even sea beach kind howev ha defect use masonri dri slowli wall cannot built without interrupt time time must paus work wall cannot carri vault furthermor sea sand use wall coat stucco salti effloresc given spoil surfac
TEXT: 3. But pitsand used in masonry dries quickly, the stuccocoating is permanent, and the walls can support vaultings. I am speaking of sand fresh from the sandpits. For if it lies unused too long after being taken out, it is disintegrated by exposure to sun, moon, or hoar frost, and becomes earthy. So when mixed in masonry, it has no binding power on the rubble, which consequently settles and down comes the load which the walls, LINE: 197, BOOK: The Ten Books on Architecture by Vitruvius, KEYWORD: use masonri dri quickli perman wall support vault speak sand fresh lie unus long taken exposur sun moon hoar frost becom earthi mix masonri ha bind power rubbl consequ settl come load wall
TEXT: can no longer support. Fresh pitsand, however, in spite of all its excellence in concrete structures, is not equally useful in stucco, the richness of which, when the lime and straw are mixed with such sand, will cause it to crack as it dries on account of the great strength of the mixture. But river sand, though useless in "signinum" on account of its thinness, becomes perfectly solid in stucco when thoroughly worked by means of polishing instruments., LINE: 198, BOOK: The Ten Books on Architecture by Vitruvius, KEYWORD: longer support fresh howev spite excel concret structur equal use stucco rich lime straw mix sand caus crack dri account great strength mixtur river sand though useless account thin becom perfectli solid stucco thoroughli work mean instrument
TEXT: CHAPTER VLIME1. Sand and its sources having been thus treated, next withregard to lime we must be careful that it is burned from a stone which, whether soft or hard, is in any case white. Lime made of close-grained stone of the harder sort will be good in structural parts; lime of porous stone, in stucco.

TEXT: 2. The reason why lime makes a solid structure on beingcombined with water and sand seems to be this: that rocks, like all other bodies, are composed of the four elements. Those which contain a larger proportion of air, are soft; of water, are tough from the moisture; of earth, hard; and of fire, more brittle., LINE: 200, BOOK: The Ten Books on Architecture by Vitruvius, KEYWORD: reason lime make solid structur water sand rock like bodi compos four element contain proport air soft water tough moistur earth hard fire brittl
TEXT: Therefore, if limestone, without being burned, is merely pounded up small and then mixed with sand and so put into the work, the mass does not solidify nor can it hold together. But if the stone is first thrown into the kiln, it loses its former property of solidity by exposure to the great heat of the fire, and so with its strength burnt out and exhausted it is left with its pores open and empty. Hence, the moisture and air in the body of the stone being burned out and set free, and only a residuum of heat being left lying in it, if the stone is then immersed in water, the moisture, before the water can feel the influence of the fire, makes its way into the open pores; then the stone begins to get hot, and finally, after it cools off, the heat is rejected from the body of the lime., LINE: 201, BOOK: The Ten Books on Architecture by Vitruvius, KEYWORD: therefor limeston without burn mere small mix sand put work mass doe solidifi hold togeth stone first thrown kiln former properti solid exposur great heat fire strength burnt exhaust left pore open empti henc moistur air bodi stone burn set free residuum heat left lie stone water moistur water feel influenc fire make way open pore stone begin get hot final cool heat bodi lime
TEXT: 3. Consequently, limestone when taken out of the kiln cannotbe as heavy as when it was thrown in, but on being weighed, though its bulk remains the same as before, it is found to have lost about a third of its weight owing to the boiling out of the water. Therefore, its pores being thus opened and its texture rendered loose, it readily mixes with sand, and hence the two materials cohere as they dry, unite with the rubble, and make a solid structure., LINE: 202, BOOK: The Ten Books on Architecture by Vitruvius, KEYWORD: consequ limeston taken kiln heavi wa thrown weigh though bulk remain found lost third weight owe boil water therefor pore thu textur loos readili mix sand henc two materi coher dri unit rubbl make solid structur

TEXT: Vesuvius. This substance, when mixed with lime and rubble, not only lends strength to buildings of other kinds, but even when piers of it are constructed in the sea, they set hard under water. The reason for this seems to be that the soil on the slopes of the mountains in these neighbourhoods is hot and full of hot springs. This would not be so unless the mountains had beneath them huge fires of burning sulphur or alum or asphalt. So the fire and the heat of the flames, coming up hot from far within through the fissures, make the soil there light, and the tufa found there is spongy and free from moisture. Hence, when the three substances, all formed on a similar principle by the force of fire, are mixed together, the water suddenly taken in makes them cohere, and the moisture quickly hardens them so that they set into a mass which neither the waves nor the force of the water can dissolve., LINE: 204, BOOK: The Ten Books on Architecture by Vitruvius, KEYWORD: vesuviu substanc mix lime rubbl strength build kind even pier sea set hard water reason soil slope mountain hot full hot spring would unless mountain beneath huge fire burn sulphur alum asphalt fire heat flame come hot far within fissur make soil light tufa found spongi free moistur henc three substanc form similar principl forc fire mix togeth water suddenli taken make coher moistur quickli set mass neither wave forc water dissolv
TEXT: 2. That there is burning heat in these regions may be proved bythe further fact that in the mountains near Baiae, which belongs to the Cumaeans, there are places excavated to serve as sweating-baths, where the intense heat that comes from far below bores its way through the earth, owing to the force of the fire, and passing up appears in these regions, thus making remarkably good sweating-baths. Likewise also it is related that in ancient times the tides of heat, swelling and overflowing from under Mt. Vesuvius, vomited forth fire from the mountain upon the neighbouring country. Hence, what is called "sponge-stone" or "Pompeian pumice" appears to have been reduced by burning from another kind of stone to the condition of the kind which we see., LINE: 205, BOOK: The Ten Books on Architecture by Vitruvius, KEYWORD: burn heat region may prove fact mountain near place serv sweat bath intens heat come far bore way earth owe forc fire pass region thu make remark good sweat bath likewis also relat ancient time tide heat swell overflow vesuviu forth fire mountain upon countri henc spong stone pumic reduc burn anoth kind stone condit kind see

The kind of sponge-stone taken from this region is notproduced everywhere else, but only about Aetna and among thehills of Mysia which the Greeks call the "Burnt District," and in other places of the same peculiar nature. Seeing that in such places there are found hot springs and warm vapour in excavations on the mountains, and that the ancients tell us that there were once fires spreading over the fields in those very regions, it seems to be certain that moisture has been extracted from the tufa and earth, by the force of fire, just as it is from limestone in kilns., LINE: 206, BOOK: The Ten Books on Architecture by Vitruvius, KEYWORD: kind spong stone taken region everywher els among call burnt district place peculiar natur see place found hot spring warm excav mountain ancient tell fire spread field region certain moistur ha extract tufa earth forc fire limeston kiln

In particular, it may be observed that sandpits are hardly ever lacking in any place within the districts of Italy and Tuscany which are bounded by the Apennines; whereas across the Apennines toward the Adriatic none are found, and in Achaea and Asia Minor or, in short, across the sea, the very term is unknown.

TEXT: 6. Therefore, where the mountains are not earthy but consist ofsoft stone, the force of the fire, passing through the fissures in the stone, sets it afire. The soft and delicate part is burned out, while the hard part is left. Consequently, while in Campania the burning of the earth makes ashes, in Tuscany the combustion of the stone makes carbuncular sand. Both are excellent in walls, but one is better to use for buildings on land, the other for piers under salt water. The Tuscan stone is softer in quality than tufa but harder than earth, and being thoroughly kindled by the violent heat from below, the result is the production in some places of the kind of sand called carbuncular., LINE: 211, BOOK: The Ten Books on Architecture by Vitruvius, KEYWORD: therefor mountain earthi consist stone forc fire pass fissur stone set afir soft delic part burn hard part left consequ burn earth make ash combust stone make carbuncular sand excel wall one better use build land pier salt water stone qualiti tufa harder earth thoroughli violent heat result product place kind sand carbuncular

Next comes the consideration of stone-quarries from which dimension stone and supplies of rubble to be used in building are taken and brought together. The stone in quarries is found to be of different and unlike qualities. In some it is soft: for example, in the environs of the city at the quarries of Grotta Rossa, Palla, Fidenae, and of the Alban hills; in others, it is medium, as at Tivoli, at Amiternum, or Mt. Soracte, and in quarries of this sort; in still others it is hard, as in lava quarries. There are also numerous other kinds: for instance, in Campania, red and black tufas; in Umbria, Picenum, and Venetia, white tufa which can be cut with a toothed saw, like wood., LINE: 213, BOOK: The Ten Books on Architecture by Vitruvius, KEYWORD: chapter spoken lime sand varieti excel next come consider stone quarri dimens stone suppli rubbl use build taken brought togeth stone quarri found differ unlik qualiti soft exampl environ citi quarri palla alban hill medium tivoli quarri sort still hard lava quarri also numer kind instanc red black tufa white tufa cut tooth saw like wood

But since, on account of the proximity of the stone-quarriesof Grotta Rossa, Palla, and the others that are nearest to the city, necessity drives us to make use of their products, we must proceed as follows, if we wish our work to be finished without flaws. Let the stone be taken from the quarry two years before building is to begin, and not in winter but in summer. Then let it lie exposed in an open place. Such stone as has been damaged by the two years of exposure should be used in the foundations. The rest, which remains unhurt, has passed the test of nature and will endure in those parts of the building which are above ground. This precaution should be observed, not only with dimension stone, but also with the rubble which is to be used in walls., LINE: 221, BOOK: The Ten Books on Architecture by Vitruvius, KEYWORD: sinc account proxim stone palla nearest citi necess drive make use product must proceed wish work finish without flaw let stone taken quarri two year build begin winter summer let lie expos open place stone ha two year exposur use foundat rest remain unhurt ha test natur endur part build ground precaut dimens stone also rubbl use wall
TEXT: Photo. MoscioniEXAMPLE OF OPUS INCERTUM. THE CIRCULAR TEMPLE AT TIVOLICHAPTER VIIIMETHODS OF BUILDING WALLS1. There are two styles of walls: "opus reticulatum," now usedby everybody, and the ancient style called "opus incertum." Of these, the reticulatum looks better, but its construction makes it likely to crack, because its beds and builds spread out in every direction. On the other hand, in the opus incertum, the rubble,, LINE: 222, BOOK: The Ten Books on Architecture by Vitruvius, KEYWORD: photo opu circular templ build wall two style wall opu everybodi ancient style opu look better construct make like crack bed build spread everi direct hand opu rubbl
TEXT: lying in courses and imbricated, makes a wall which, though not beautiful, is stronger than the reticulatum.2. Both kinds should be constructed of the smallest stones, sothat the walls, being thoroughly puddled with the mortar, which is made of lime and sand, may hold together longer. Since the stones used are soft and porous, they are apt to suck the moisture out of the mortar and so to dry it up. But when there is abundance of lime and sand, the wall, containing more moisture, will not soon lose its strength, for they will hold it together. But as soon as the moisture is sucked out of the mortar by the porous rubble, and the lime and sand separate and disunite, the rubble can no longer adhere to them and the wall will in time become a ruin., LINE: 223, BOOK: The Ten Books on Architecture by Vitruvius, KEYWORD: lie cours imbric make wall though beauti kind stone wall thoroughli puddl mortar made lime sand may hold togeth longer sinc stone use soft porou apt suck moistur mortar dri abund lime sand wall moistur soon lose strength hold togeth soon moistur mortar porou rubbl lime sand separ disunit rubbl longer adher wall time becom ruin
TEXT: 3. This we may learn from several monuments in the environsof the city, which are built of marble or dimension stone, but on the inside packed with masonry between the outer walls.

He who wishes to avoid such a disaster should leave acavity behind the facings, and on the inside build walls two feet thick, made of red dimension stone or burnt brick or lava in courses, and then bind them to the fronts by means of iron clamps and lead. For thus his work, being no mere heap of material but regularly laid in courses, will be strong enough to last forever without a flaw, because the beds and builds, all settling equally and bonded at the joints, will not let the work, LINE: 225, BOOK: The Ten Books on Architecture by Vitruvius, KEYWORD: wish avoid disast leav behind face insid build wall two foot thick made red dimens stone burnt brick lava cours bind front mean iron clamp lead thu work mere heap materi regularli laid cours strong enough last forev without flaw bed build settl equal bond joint let work
TEXT: bulge out, nor allow the fall of the face walls which have been tightly fastened together.5. Consequently, the method of construction employed by theGreeks is not to be despised. They do not use a structure of soft rubble polished on the outside, but whenever they forsake dimension stone, they lay courses of lava or of some hard stone, and, as though building with brick, they bind the upright joints by interchanging the direction of the stones as they lie in the courses. Thus they attain to a perfection that will endure to eternity. These structures are of two kinds. One of them is called "isodomum," the other "pseudisodomum.", LINE: 226, BOOK: The Ten Books on Architecture by Vitruvius, KEYWORD: bulg allow fall face wall tightli togeth consequ method construct employ use structur soft rubbl polish outsid whenev forsak dimens stone lay cours lava hard stone though build brick bind upright joint direct stone lie cours thu attain perfect endur etern structur two kind one isodomum pseudisodomum
TEXT: 6. A wall is called isodomum when all the courses are of equalheight; pseudisodomum, when the rows of courses do not match but run unequally. Both kinds are strong: first, because the rubble itself is of close texture and solid, unable to suck the moisture out of the mortar, but keeping it in its moist condition for a very long period; secondly, because the beds of the stones, being laid smooth and level to begin with, keep the mortar from falling, and, as they are bonded throughout the entire thickness of the wall, they hold together for a very long period., LINE: 227, BOOK: The Ten Books on Architecture by Vitruvius, KEYWORD: wall isodomum cours pseudisodomum row cours match run unequ kind strong first rubbl close textur solid unabl suck moistur mortar keep moist condit long period secondli bed stone laid smooth level begin keep mortar fall bond throughout entir thick wall hold togeth long period

In this the facings are finished, but the other stones left in their natural state and then laid with alternate bonding stones. But our workmen, in their hurry to finish, devote themselves only to the facings of the walls, setting them upright but filling the space between with a lot of broken stones and mortar thrown in anyhow. This makes three different sections in the same structure; two consisting of facing and one of filling between them.

These stones, which show at each end, are called διἁτονοι, and by their bonding powers they add very greatly to the solidity of the walls., LINE: 229, BOOK: The Ten Books on Architecture by Vitruvius, KEYWORD: lay stone level build everi stone length wise thick fill space construct thick wall one solid unbroken mass face interior interv lay singl stone run entir thick wall stone show end bond power add greatli solid wall

TEXT: 18. It has now been explained how limitations of buildingspace necessarily forbid the employment of brick walls within the city. When it becomes necessary to use them outside the city, they should be constructed as follows in order to be perfect and durable. On the top of the wall lay a structure of burnt brick, about a foot and a half in height, under the tiles and projecting like a coping. Thus the defects usual in these walls can be avoided. For when the tiles on the roof are broken or thrown down by the wind so that rainwater can leak through, this burnt brick coating will prevent the crude brick from being damaged, and the cornice-like projection will throw off the drops beyond the vertical face, and thus the walls, though of crude brick structure, will be preserved intact., LINE: 246, BOOK: The Ten Books on Architecture by Vitruvius, KEYWORD: ha limit necessarili forbid employ brick wall within citi becom necessari use outsid citi order perfect durabl top wall lay structur burnt brick foot half height tile project like cope thu defect usual wall tile roof broken thrown wind leak burnt brick coat prevent crude brick cornic like project throw drop beyond vertic face thu wall though crude brick structur intact
TEXT: 19. With regard to burnt brick, nobody can tell offhandwhether it is of the best or unfit to use in a wall, because its strength can be tested only after it has been used on a roof and exposed to bad weather and time—then, if it is good it is accepted. If not made of good clay or if not baked sufficiently, it shows itself defective there when exposed to frosts and rime. Brick that will not stand exposure on roofs can never be strong enough to carry its load in a wall. Hence the strongest burnt brick walls are those which are constructed out of old roofing tiles., LINE: 247, BOOK: The Ten Books on Architecture by Vitruvius, KEYWORD: regard burnt brick nobodi tell best unfit use wall strength test ha use roof expos bad weather time good accept made good clay bake suffici show defect expos frost rime brick stand exposur roof never strong enough carri load wall henc burnt brick wall old roof tile

The more it saves in time and gains in space, the greater and the more general is the disaster that it may cause; for it is made to catch fire, like torches.

But since some are obliged to use it either to save time or money, or for partitions on an unsupported span, the proper method of construction is as follows. Give it a high foundation so that it may nowhere come in contact with the broken stone-work composing the floor; for if it is sunk in this, it rots in course of time, then settles and sags forward, and so breaks through the surface of the stucco covering., LINE: 249, BOOK: The Ten Books on Architecture by Vitruvius, KEYWORD: arrang stud swell moistur contract dri shrink caus solid stucco split sinc oblig use either save time money partit unsupport span proper method construct give high foundat may nowher come contact broken stone work floor sunk rot cours time settl sag forward break surfac stucco cover

For in Spring all trees become pregnant, and they are all employing their natural vigour in the production of leaves and of the fruits that return every year. The requirements of that season render them empty and swollen, and so they are weak and feeble because of their looseness of texture. This is also the case with women who have conceived., LINE: 251, BOOK: The Ten Books on Architecture by Vitruvius, KEYWORD: chapter timber earli autumn begin blow spring tree becom pregnant natur product leaf fruit return everi year requir season render empti swollen weak feebl loos textur also case woman
TEXT: Their bodies are not considered perfectly healthy until the child is born; hence, pregnant slaves, when offered for sale, are not warranted sound, because the fetus as it grows within the body takes to itself as nourishment all the best qualities of the mother's food, and so the stronger it becomes as the full time for birth approaches, the less compact it allows that body to be from which it is produced. After the birth of the child, what was heretofore taken to promote the growth of another creature is now set free by the delivery of the newborn, and the channels being now empty and open, the body will take it in by lapping up its juices, and thus becomes compact and returns to the natural strength which it had before., LINE: 252, BOOK: The Ten Books on Architecture by Vitruvius, KEYWORD: bodi consid perfectli healthi child born henc pregnant slave sale warrant sound fetu within bodi take nourish best qualiti mother food becom full time birth approach less compact bodi produc birth child wa heretofor taken promot growth anoth creatur set free deliveri channel empti open bodi take lap juic thu becom compact return natur strength

On the same principle, with the ripening of the fruits inAutumn the leaves begin to wither and the trees, taking up their sap from the earth through the roots, recover themselves and are restored to their former solid texture.

TEXT: 3. In felling a tree we should cut into the trunk of it to the veryheart, and then leave it standing so that the sap may drain out drop by drop throughout the whole of it. In this way the useless liquid which is within will run out through the sapwood instead of having to die in a mass of decay, thus spoiling the quality of the timber. Then and not till then, the tree being drained dry and the sap no longer dripping, let it be felled and it will be in the highest state of usefulness., LINE: 254, BOOK: The Ten Books on Architecture by Vitruvius, KEYWORD: fell tree cut trunk leav stand sap may drain drop drop throughout whole way useless liquid within run sapwood instead die mass decay thu spoil qualiti timber till tree drain dri sap longer drip let highest state use

Whenthese are tapped at the base and pruned, each at the proper time,they pour out from the heart through the tapholes all the superfluous and corrupting fluid which they contain, and thus the draining process makes them durable. But when the juices of trees have no means of escape, they clot and rot in them, making the trees hollow and good for nothing. Therefore, if the draining process does not exhaust them while they are still alive, there is no doubt that, if the same principle is followed in felling them for timber, they will last a long time and be very useful in buildings., LINE: 255, BOOK: The Ten Books on Architecture by Vitruvius, KEYWORD: may seen case fruit tree base proper time pour heart superflu corrupt fluid contain thu process make durabl juic tree mean escap clot rot make tree hollow good noth therefor process doe exhaust still aliv doubt principl fell timber last long time use build
TEXT: 5. Trees vary and are unlike one another in their qualities.Thus it is with the oak, elm, poplar, cypress, fir, and the others which are most suitable to use in buildings. The oak, for instance, has not the efficacy of the fir, nor the cypress that of the elm. Nor in the case of other trees, is it natural that they should be alike; but the individual kinds are effective in building, some in one way, some in another, owing to the different properties of their elements., LINE: 256, BOOK: The Ten Books on Architecture by Vitruvius, KEYWORD: tree vari unlik one anoth qualiti thu oak elm poplar cypress fir suitabl use build oak instanc ha efficaci fir cypress elm case tree natur alik individu kind effect build one way anoth owe differ properti element
TEXT: 6. To begin with fir: it contains a great deal of air and fire withvery little moisture and the earthy, so that, as its natural properties are of the lighter class, it is not heavy. Hence, its consistence being naturally stiff, it does not easily bend under the load, and keeps its straightness when used in the framework. But it contains so much heat that it generates and encourages decay, which spoils it; and it also kindles fire quickly because of the air in its body, which is so open that it takes in fire and so gives out a great flame., LINE: 257, BOOK: The Ten Books on Architecture by Vitruvius, KEYWORD: begin fir great deal air fire littl moistur earthi natur properti lighter class heavi henc consist natur stiff doe easili bend load keep straight use framework much heat decay spoil also fire quickli air bodi open take fire give great flame

Oak, on the other hand, having enough and to spare of theearthy among its elements, and containing but little moisture, air, and fire, lasts for an unlimited period when buried in underground structures. It follows that when exposed to moisture, as its texture is not loose and porous, it cannot take in liquid on account of its compactness, but, withdrawing from the moisture, it resists it and warps, thus making cracks in the structures in which it is used., LINE: 260, BOOK: The Ten Books on Architecture by Vitruvius, KEYWORD: oak hand enough spare among element littl moistur air fire last unlimit period buri underground structur expos moistur textur loos porou cannot take liquid account compact withdraw moistur warp thu make crack structur use

The winter oak, being composed of a moderate amount ofall the elements, is very useful in buildings, but when in a moist place, it takes in water to its centre through its pores, its air and fire being expelled by the influence of the moisture, and so it rots. The Turkey oak and the beech, both containing a mixture of moisture, fire, and the earthy, with a great deal of air, through this loose texture take in moisture to their centre and soon decay. White and black poplar, as well as willow, linden, and the agnus castus, containing an abundance of fire and air, a moderate amount of moisture, and only a small amount of the earthy, are composed of a mixture which is proportionately rather light, and so they are of great service from their stiffness.

TEXT: 10. The alder, which is produced close by river banks, andwhich seems to be altogether useless as building material, has really excellent qualities. It is composed of a very large proportion of air and fire, not much of the earthy, and only a little moisture. Hence, in swampy places, alder piles driven close together beneath the foundations of buildings take in the water which their own consistence lacks and remain imperishable forever, supporting structures of enormous weight and keeping them from decay. Thus a material which cannot last even a little while above ground, endures for a long time when covered with moisture., LINE: 262, BOOK: The Ten Books on Architecture by Vitruvius, KEYWORD: alder produc close river bank altogeth useless build materi ha realli excel qualiti compos larg proport air fire much earthi littl moistur henc swampi place alder pile driven close togeth beneath foundat build take water consist lack remain imperish forev support structur enorm weight keep decay thu materi cannot last even littl ground long time cover moistur

The elm and the ash contain a very great amount of moisture, a minimum of air and fire, and a moderate mixture of the earthy in their composition. When put in shape for use in buildings they are tough and, having no stiffness on account of the weight of moisture in them, soon bend. But when they become dry with age, or are allowed to lose their sap and die standing in the open, they get harder, and from their toughness supply a strong material for dowels to be used in joints and other articulations., LINE: 263, BOOK: The Ten Books on Architecture by Vitruvius, KEYWORD: one see best public privat pile sort beneath foundat elm ash contain great amount moistur minimum air fire moder mixtur earthi composit put shape use build tough stiff account weight moistur soon bend becom dri age lose sap die stand open get harder tough suppli strong materi dowel use joint articul

Books as well as other things smeared with this are not hurt by worms or decay. The foliage of this tree is like that of the cypress but the grain of the wood is straight. The statue of Diana in the temple at Ephesus is made of it, and so are the coffered ceilings both there and in all other famous fanes, because that wood is everlasting.

TEXT: 14. The larch, known only to the people of the towns on thebanks of the river Po and the shores of the Adriatic, is not only preserved from decay and the worm by the great bitterness of its sap, but also it cannot be kindled with fire nor ignite of itself, unless like stone in a limekiln it is burned with other wood. And even then it does not take fire nor produce burning coals, but after a long time it slowly consumes away. This is because there is a very small proportion of the elements of fire and air in its composition, which is a dense and solid mass of moisture and the earthy, so that it has no open pores through which fire can find its way; but it repels the force of fire and does not let itself be harmed by it quickly. Further, its weight will not let it float in water, so that when transported it is loaded on shipboard or on rafts made of fir., LINE: 267, BOOK: The Ten Books on Architecture by Vitruvius, KEYWORD: larch known peopl town river shore decay worm great bitter sap also cannot fire ignit unless like stone limekiln burn wood even doe take fire produc burn coal long time slowli away small proport element fire air composit dens solid mass moistur earthi ha open pore fire find way forc fire doe let quickli weight let float water transport load shipboard raft made fir

It is worth while to know how this wood was discovered.The divine Caesar, being with his army in the neighbourhood of the Alps, and having ordered the towns to furnish supplies, the inhabitants of a fortified stronghold there, called Larignum, trusting in the natural strength of their defences, refused to obey his command. So the general ordered his forces to the assault. In front of the gate of this stronghold there was a tower, made of beams of this wood laid in alternating directions at right angles to each other, like a funeral pyre, and built high, so that they could drive off an attacking party by throwing stakes and stones from the top. When it was observed that they had no other missiles than stakes, and that these could not be hurled very far from the wall on account of the weight, orders were given to approach and to throw bundles of brushwood and lighted torches at this outwork. These the soldiers soon got together., LINE: 268, BOOK: The Ten Books on Architecture by Vitruvius, KEYWORD: worth know wood wa discov divin armi alp order town furnish suppli inhabit stronghold trust natur strength defenc obey command gener order forc assault front gate stronghold wa tower made beam wood laid altern direct right angl like funer pyre built high could drive parti throw stake stone top wa missil stake could hurl far wall account weight order given approach throw bundl brushwood torch outwork soldier soon got togeth

But when the fire had burned itself out and subsided, and the tower appeared to view entirely uninjured, Caesar in amazement gave orders that they should be surrounded with a palisade, built beyond the range of missiles. So the townspeople were frightened into surrendering, and were then asked where that wood came from which was not harmed by fire. They pointed to trees of the kind under discussion, of which there are very great numbers in that vicinity. And so, as that stronghold was called Larignum, the wood was called larch. It is transported by way of the Po to Ravenna, and is to be had in Fano, Pesaro, Ancona, and the other towns in that neighbourhood.

But the further side, sloping towards the Upper Sea and having a northern exposure, is constantly shrouded in shadowy darkness. Hence the trees which grow on that side, being nourished by the moisture, not only themselves attain to a very large size, but their fibre too, filled full of moisture, is swollen and distended with abundance of liquid. When they lose their vitality after being felled and hewn, the fibre retains its stiffness, and the trees as they dry become hollow and frail on account of their porosity, and hence cannot last when used in buildings., LINE: 274, BOOK: The Ten Books on Architecture by Vitruvius, KEYWORD: shore middl curv circuit extend strait shore henc side curv slope toward district lie sun constantli expos full forc ray day side slope toward upper sea northern exposur constantli shroud shadowi dark henc tree grow side moistur attain larg size fill full moistur swollen abund liquid lose vital hewn stiff tree dri becom hollow frail account poros henc cannot last use build

But trees which grow in places facing the course of the sunare not of porous fibre but are solid, being drained by the dryness; for the sun absorbs moisture and draws it out of trees as well as out of the earth.

In my first book, Emperor, I described to you the art, withits points of excellence, the different kinds of training with which the architect ought to be equipped, adding the reasons why he ought to be skilful in them, and I divided up the subject of architecture as a whole among its departments, duly defining the limits of each. Next, as was preëminent and necessary, I explained on scientific principles the method of selecting healthy sites for fortified towns, pointed out by geometrical figures the different winds and the quarters from which they blow, and showed the proper way to lay out the lines of streets and rows of houses within the walls. Here I fixed the end of my first book. In the second, on building materials, I treated their various advantages in structures, and the natural properties of which they are composed.

TEXT: CHAPTER ION SYMMETRY: IN TEMPLES AND IN THE HUMAN BODY1. The design of a temple depends on symmetry, the principlesof which must be most carefully observed by the architect. They are due to proportion, in Greek ἁναλογἱα. Proportion is a correspondence among the measures of the members of an entire work, and of the whole to a certain part selected as standard. From this result the principles of symmetry. Without symmetry and proportion there can be no principles in the design of any temple; that is, if there is no precise relation between its members, as in the case of those of a well shaped man., LINE: 289, BOOK: The Ten Books on Architecture by Vitruvius, KEYWORD: chapter ion symmetri templ human bodi design templ symmetri must care architect due proport proport correspond among measur member entir work whole certain part select standard result principl symmetri without symmetri proport principl design templ precis relat member case well shape man
TEXT: 2. For the human body is so designed by nature that the face,from the chin to the top of the forehead and the lowest roots of the hair, is a tenth part of the whole height; the open hand from the wrist to the tip of the middle finger is just the same; the head from the chin to the crown is an eighth, and with the neck and shoulder from the top of the breast to the lowest roots of the hair is a sixth; from the middle of the breast to the summit of the crown is a fourth. If we take the height of the face itself, the distance from the bottom of the chin to the under side of the nostrils is one third of it; the nose from the under side of the nostrils to a line between the eyebrows is the same; from there to the lowest roots of the hair is also a third, comprising the forehead.

The other members, too, have their own symmetrical proportions, and it was by employing them that the famous painters and sculptors of antiquity attained to great and endless renown., LINE: 291, BOOK: The Ten Books on Architecture by Vitruvius, KEYWORD: bodi forearm one fourth breadth breast also one fourth member symmetr proport wa famou painter sculptor antiqu great endless renown
TEXT: 3. Similarly, in the members of a temple there ought to be thegreatest harmony in the symmetrical relations of the different parts to the general magnitude of the whole. Then again, in the human body the central point is naturally the navel. For if a man be placed flat on his back, with his hands and feet extended, and a pair of compasses centred at his navel, the fingers and toes of his two hands and feet will touch the circumference of a circle described therefrom. And just as the human body yields a circular outline, so too a square figure may be found from it. For if we measure the distance from the soles of the feet to the top of the head, and then apply that measure to the outstretched arms, the breadth will be found to be the same as the height, as in the case of plane surfaces which are perfectly square., LINE: 292, BOOK: The Ten Books on Architecture by Vitruvius, KEYWORD: similarli member templ ought harmoni symmetr relat differ part gener magnitud whole human bodi central point natur navel man flat back hand foot extend pair compass navel finger toe two hand foot touch circumfer circl therefrom human bodi yield circular outlin squar figur may found measur distanc sol foot top head appli measur arm breadth found height case plane surfac perfectli squar
TEXT: 4. Therefore, since nature has designed the human body so thatits members are duly proportioned to the frame as a whole, it appears that the ancients had good reason for their rule, that in perfect buildings the different members must be in exact symmetrical relations to the whole general scheme. Hence, while transmitting to us the proper arrangements for buildings of all kinds, they were particularly careful to do so in the case of temples of the gods, buildings in which merits and faults usually last forever., LINE: 293, BOOK: The Ten Books on Architecture by Vitruvius, KEYWORD: therefor sinc natur ha design human bodi member duli proport frame whole ancient good reason rule perfect build differ member must exact symmetr relat whole gener scheme henc proper arrang build kind particularli care case templ god build merit fault usual last forev
TEXT: 5. Further, it was from the members of the body that theyderived the fundamental ideas of the measures which are obviously necessary in all works, as the finger, palm, foot, andcubit. These they apportioned so as to form the "perfect number," called in Greek τἑλειον, and as the perfect number the ancients fixed upon ten. For it is from the number of the fingers of the hand that the palm is found, and the foot from the palm. Again, while ten is naturally perfect, as being made up by the fingers of the two palms, Plato also held that this number was perfect because ten is composed of the individual units, called by the Greeks μονἁδες. But as soon as eleven or twelve is reached, the numbers, being excessive, cannot be perfect until they come to ten for the second time; for the component parts of that number are the individual units., LINE: 294, BOOK: The Ten Books on Architecture by Vitruvius, KEYWORD: wa member bodi fundament idea measur obvious necessari work finger palm foot form perfect number perfect number ancient fix upon ten number finger hand palm found foot palm ten natur perfect made finger two palm also number wa perfect ten compos individu unit soon eleven twelv number excess cannot perfect come ten second time compon part number individu unit
TEXT: 6. The mathematicians, however, maintaining a different view,have said that the perfect number is six, because this number is composed of integral parts which are suited numerically to their method of reckoning: thus, one is one sixth; two is one third; three is one half; four is two thirds, or δἱμοιρος as they call it; five is five sixths, called πεντἁμοιρος; and six is the perfect number. As the number goes on growing larger, the addition of a unit above six is the ἑφεκτος; eight, formed by the addition of a third part of six, is the integer and a third, called ἑπἱτριτος; the addition of one half makes nine, the integer and a half, termed ἡμιὁλιος; the addition of two thirds, making the number ten, is the integer and two thirds, which they call ἑπιδἱμοιρος; in the number eleven, where five are added, we have the five sixths, called ἑπἱπεμπτος; finally, twelve, being composed of the two simple integers, is called διπλἁσιος., LINE: 295, BOOK: The Ten Books on Architecture by Vitruvius, KEYWORD: mathematician howev differ view said perfect number six number compos integr part numer method reckon thu one one sixth two one third three one half four two third call five five sixth six perfect number number go grow addit unit six eight form addit third part six integ third addit one half make nine integ half addit two third make number ten integ two third call number eleven five ad five sixth final twelv compos two simpl integ
TEXT: 7. And further, as the foot is one sixth of a man's height, theheight of the body as expressed in number of feet being limited to six, they held that this was the perfect number, and observedthat the cubit consisted of six palms or of twenty-four fingers. This principle seems to have been followed by the states of Greece. As the cubit consisted of six palms, they made the drachma, which they used as their unit, consist in the same way of six bronze coins, like our asses, which they call obols; and, to correspond to the fingers, divided the drachma into twenty-four quarter-obols, which some call dichalca others trichalca., LINE: 296, BOOK: The Ten Books on Architecture by Vitruvius, KEYWORD: foot one sixth man height bodi express number foot limit six wa perfect number cubit six palm twenti four finger principl state cubit six palm made drachma use unit consist way six bronz coin like ass call correspond finger divid drachma twenti four quarter call
TEXT: 8. But our countrymen at first fixed upon the ancient numberand made ten bronze pieces go to the denarius, and this is the origin of the name which is applied to the denarius to this day. And the fourth part of it, consisting of two asses and half of a third, they called "sesterce." But later, observing that six and ten were both of them perfect numbers, they combined the two, and thus made the most perfect number, sixteen. They found their authority for this in the foot. For if we take two palms from the cubit, there remains the foot of four palms; but the palm contains four fingers. Hence the foot contains sixteen fingers, and the denarius the same number of bronze asses., LINE: 297, BOOK: The Ten Books on Architecture by Vitruvius, KEYWORD: countryman first fix upon ancient made ten bronz piec denariu origin name appli denariu day fourth part two ass half third sesterc later observ six ten perfect number combin two thu made perfect number sixteen found author foot take two palm cubit remain foot four palm palm four finger henc foot sixteen finger denariu number bronz ass
TEXT: 9. Therefore, if it is agreed that number was found out fromthe human fingers, and that there is a symmetrical correspondence between the members separately and the entire form of the body, in accordance with a certain part selected as standard, we can have nothing but respect for those who, in constructing temples of the immortal gods, have so arranged the members of the works that both the separate parts and the whole design may harmonize in their proportions and symmetry., LINE: 298, BOOK: The Ten Books on Architecture by Vitruvius, KEYWORD: therefor agre number wa found human finger symmetr correspond member separ entir form bodi accord certain part select standard noth respect templ immort god member work separ part whole design may harmon proport symmetri
TEXT: CHAPTER IICLASSIFICATION OF TEMPLES1. There are certain elementary forms on which the generalaspect of a temple depends.

TEXT: CHAPTER IIITHE PROPORTIONS OF INTERCOLUMNIATIONS AND OF COLUMNS1. There are five classes of temples, designated as follows:pycnostyle, with the columns close together; systyle, with the intercolumniations a little wider; diastyle, more open still; araeostyle, farther apart than they ought to be; eustyle, with the intervals apportioned just right., LINE: 308, BOOK: The Ten Books on Architecture by Vitruvius, KEYWORD: chapter proport column five class templ pycnostyl column close togeth systyl littl open still araeostyl farther apart ought eustyl interv right

The pycnostyle is a temple in an intercolumniation of whichthe thickness of a column and a half can be inserted: for example, the temple of the Divine Caesar, that of Venus in Caesar's forum, and others constructed like them. The systyle is a temple in which the thickness of two columns can be placed in an intercolumniation, and in which the plinths of the bases are equivalent to the distance between two plinths: for example, the temple of Equestrian Fortune near the stone theatre, and the others which are constructed on the same principles., LINE: 309, BOOK: The Ten Books on Architecture by Vitruvius, KEYWORD: classif templ accord pycnostyl templ thick column half insert exampl templ divin forum like systyl templ thick two column plinth base equival distanc two plinth exampl templ equestrian fortun near stone principl

When thematrons mount the steps for public prayer or thanksgiving, theycannot pass through the intercolumniations with their arms about one another, but must form single file; then again, the effect of the folding doors is thrust out of sight by the crowding of the columns, and likewise the statues are thrown into shadow; the narrow space interferes also with walks round the temple., LINE: 310, BOOK: The Ten Books on Architecture by Vitruvius, KEYWORD: two kind practic disadvantag mount step public prayer thanksgiv arm one anoth must form singl file effect fold door thrust sight column likewis statu thrown shadow narrow space also walk round templ

Ifa tetrastyle is to be built, let the width of the front which shall have already been determined for the temple, be divided into eleven parts and a half, not including the substructures and the projections of the bases; if it is to be of six columns, into eighteen parts. If an octastyle is to be constructed, let the front be divided into twenty-four parts and a half. Then, whether the temple is to be tetrastyle, hexastyle, or octastyle, let one of these parts be taken, and it will be the module. The thickness of the columns will be equal to one module.

TEXT: 8. We have no example of this in Rome, but at Teos in AsiaMinor there is one which is hexastyle, dedicated to Father Bacchus.These rules for symmetry were established by Hermogenes,who was also the first to devise the principle of the pseudodipteral octastyle. He did so by dispensing with the inner rows of thirty-eight columns which belonged to the symmetry of the dipteral temple, and in this way he made a saving in expense and labour. He thus provided a much wider space for the walk round the cella between it and the columns, and without detracting at all from the general effect, or making one feel the loss of what had been really superfluous, he preserved the dignity of the whole work by his new treatment of it., LINE: 316, BOOK: The Ten Books on Architecture by Vitruvius, KEYWORD: exampl one hexastyl father rule symmetri establish wa also first devis principl pseudodipter octastyl inner row thirti eight column symmetri dipter templ way made save expens labour thu provid much space walk round cella column without gener effect make one feel loss realli superflu digniti whole work new treatment
TEXT: 9. For the idea of the pteroma and the arrangement of thecolumns round a temple were devised in order that the intercolumniations might give the imposing effect of high relief; and also, in case a multitude of people should be caught in a heavy shower and detained, that they might have in the temple and round the cella a wide free space in which to wait. These ideas are developed, as I have described, in the pseudodipteral arrangement of a temple. It appears, therefore, that Hermogenes produced results which exhibit much acute ingenuity, and that he left sources from which those who came after him could derive instructive principles., LINE: 317, BOOK: The Ten Books on Architecture by Vitruvius, KEYWORD: idea pteroma arrang round templ order might give impos effect high relief also case multitud peopl caught heavi shower might templ round cella wide free space wait idea pseudodipter arrang templ therefor produc result exhibit much acut ingenu left sourc came could deriv instruct principl
TEXT: VITRUVIUS' RULES FOR THE DIAMETER AND HEIGHT OF COLUMNS IN THE DIFFERENT CLASSESOF TEMPLE COMPARED WITH ACTUAL EXAMPLES10. In araeostyle temples, the columns should be constructedso that their thickness is one eighth part of their height. In the diastyle, the height of a column should be measured off into eight and a half parts, and the thickness of the column fixed at one of these parts. In the systyle, let the height be divided into nine and a half parts, and one of these given to the thickness of the column. In the pycnostyle, the height should be divided into ten parts, and one of these used for the thickness of the column. In the eustyle temple, let the height of a column be divided, as in the systyle, into nine and a half parts, and let one part be taken for the thickness at the bottom of the shaft. With these dimensions we shall be taking into account the proportions of the intercolumniations., LINE: 318, BOOK: The Ten Books on Architecture by Vitruvius, KEYWORD: rule diamet height column differ templ actual exampl araeostyl templ column thick one eighth part height height column measur eight half part thick column fix one part systyl let height divid nine half part one given thick column pycnostyl height divid ten part one use thick column eustyl templ let height column divid systyl nine half part let one part taken thick bottom shaft dimens shall take account proport

TEXT: because the width of the intercolumniations is such that the air seems to eat away and diminish the thickness of such shafts. On the other hand, in pycnostyles, if an eighth part is given to the thickness, it will make the shaft look swollen and ungraceful, because the intercolumniations are so close to each other and so narrow. We must therefore follow the rules of symmetry required by each kind of building. Then, too, the columns at the corners should be made thicker than the others by a fiftieth of their own diameter, because they are sharply outlined by the unobstructed air round them, and seem to the beholder more slender than they are. Hence, we must counteract the ocular deception by an adjustment of proportions., LINE: 320, BOOK: The Ten Books on Architecture by Vitruvius, KEYWORD: width air eat away diminish thick shaft hand eighth part given thick make shaft look swollen ungrac close narrow must therefor follow rule symmetri kind build column corner made fiftieth diamet sharpli outlin unobstruct air round seem behold slender henc must counteract ocular decept adjust proport

The foundations of these works should be dug out of thesolid ground, if it can be found, and carried down into solid ground as far as the magnitude of the work shall seem to require, and the whole substructure should be as solid as it can possibly be laid. Above ground, let walls be laid under the columns, thicker by one half than the columns are to be, so that the lower may be stronger than the higher. Hence they are called "stereobates"; for they take the load. And the projections of the bases should not extend beyond this solid foundation. The wall- thickness is similarly to be preserved above ground likewise, and the intervals between these walls should be vaulted over, or filled with earth rammed down hard, to keep the walls well apart., LINE: 326, BOOK: The Ten Books on Architecture by Vitruvius, KEYWORD: chapter foundat substructur templ foundat work dug ground found carri solid ground far magnitud work shall seem requir whole substructur solid possibl laid ground let wall laid column one half column lower may higher henc take load project base extend beyond solid foundat wall thick similarli ground likewis interv wall vault fill earth hard keep wall well apart

The columns are then to be distributed over the stylobates inthe manner above described: close together in the pycnostyle; in the systyle, diastyle, or eustyle, as they are described and arranged above. In araeostyle temples one is free to arrange them as far apart as one likes. Still, in peripterals, the columns should be so placed that there are twice as many intercolumniations on the sides as there are in front; for thus the length of the work will be twice its breadth.

The faces of the volutes must recede from the edge of the abacus inwards by one and a half eighteenths of that same amount. Then, the height of the capital is to be divided into nine and a half parts, and down along the abacus on the four sides of the volutes, down along the fillet at the edge of the abacus, lines called "catheti" are to be let fall.

So it fails when the height is great, its strength is sucked out of it, and it conveys to the mind only a confused estimate of the dimensions. Hence there must always be a corresponding increase in the symmetrical proportions of the members, so that whether the buildings are on unusually lofty sites or are themselves somewhat colossal, the size of the parts may seem in due proportion.

At the foot they substituted the base in place of a shoe; in the capital they placed the volutes, hanging down at the right and left like curly ringlets, and ornamented its front with cymatia and with festoons of fruit arranged in place of hair, while they brought the flutes down the whole shaft, falling like the folds in the robes worn by matrons.

The acanthus root, pressed down meanwhile though it was by the weight, when springtime came round put forth leaves and stalks in the middle, and the stalks, growing up along the sides of the basket, and pressed out by the corners of the tile through the compulsion of its weight, were forced to bend into volutes at the outer edges., LINE: 375, BOOK: The Ten Books on Architecture by Vitruvius, KEYWORD: relat origin discoveri form free born maiden marriag age wa ill away burial nurs littl thing use give girl pleasur wa aliv put basket carri tomb laid top thereof cover roof tile thing might last longer open air basket root acanthu acanthu root meanwhil though wa weight springtim came round put forth leaf stalk middl stalk grow along side basket corner tile compuls weight forc bend volut outer edg

Let the breadth of the abacus be proportioned so that diagonals drawn from one corner of it to the other shall be twice the height of the capitals, which will give the proper breadth to each face of the abacus.

TEXT: CHAPTER IITHE ORNAMENTS OF THE ORDERS1. Since the origin and invention of the orders of columns havebeen described above, I think it not out of place to speak in the same way about their ornaments, showing how these arose and from what original elements they were devised. The upper parts of all buildings contain timber work to which various terms are applied. And not only in its terminology but actually in its uses it exhibits variety. The main beams are those which are laid upon columns, pilasters, and antae; tie-beams and rafters are found in the framing. Under the roof, if the span is pretty large, are the crossbeams and struts; if it is of moderate extent, only the ridgepole, with the principal rafters extending to the outer edge of the eaves. Over the principal rafters are the purlines, and then above these and under the roof-tiles come the common rafters, extending so far that the walls are covered by their projection., LINE: 380, BOOK: The Ten Books on Architecture by Vitruvius, KEYWORD: chapter ornament order sinc origin invent order column think place speak way ornament show aros origin element upper part build contain timber work variou term appli terminolog actual us exhibit varieti main beam laid upon column pilast tie beam rafter found frame roof span pretti larg crossbeam strut moder extent ridgepol princip rafter extend outer edg eav princip rafter roof tile come common rafter extend far wall cover project
TEXT: 2. Thus each and every detail has a place, origin, and order ofits own. In accordance with these details, and starting from carpenter's work, artists in building temples of stone and marble imitated those arrangements in their sculptures, believing that they must follow those inventions. So it was that some ancient carpenters, engaged in building somewhere or other, after laying the tie-beams so that they projected from the inside to the outside of the walls, closed up the space between the beams, and above them ornamented the coronae and gables with carpentry work of beauty greater than usual; then they cut off the, LINE: 381, BOOK: The Ten Books on Architecture by Vitruvius, KEYWORD: thu everi detail ha place origin order accord detail start carpent work artist build templ stone marbl arrang sculptur believ must follow invent wa ancient carpent engag build somewher lay tie beam insid outsid wall close space beam corona gabl carpentri work beauti greater usual cut
TEXT: projecting ends of the beams, bringing them into line and flush with the face of the walls; next, as this had an ugly look to them, they fastened boards, shaped as triglyphs are now made, on the ends of the beams, where they had been cut off in front, and painted them with blue wax so that the cutting off of the ends of the beams, being concealed, would not offend the eye. Hence it was in imitation of the arrangement of the tie-beams that men began to employ, in Doric buildings, the device of triglyphs and the metopes between the beams., LINE: 382, BOOK: The Ten Books on Architecture by Vitruvius, KEYWORD: project end beam line flush face wall next ugli look board shape made end beam cut front paint blue wax cut end beam conceal would offend eye henc wa imit arrang tie beam men employ build devic beam
TEXT: 3. Later, others in other buildings allowed the projectingprincipal rafters to run out till they were flush with the triglyphs, and then formed their projections into simae. From that practice, like the triglyphs from the arrangement of the tie-beams, the system of mutules under the coronae was devised from the projections of the principal rafters. Hence generally, in buildings of stone and marble, the mutules are carved with a downward slant, in imitation of the principal rafters. For these necessarily have a slanting and projecting position to let the water drip down. The scheme of triglyphs and mutules in Doric buildings was, therefore, the imitative device that I have described., LINE: 383, BOOK: The Ten Books on Architecture by Vitruvius, KEYWORD: later build rafter run till flush form project practic like arrang tie beam system corona wa project princip rafter henc gener build stone marbl downward slant imit princip rafter necessarili slant project posit let water drip scheme build wa therefor imit devic
TEXT: 4. It cannot be that the triglyphs represent windows, as somehave erroneously said, since the triglyphs are placed at the corners and over the middle of columns—places where, from the nature of the case, there can be no windows at all. For buildings are wholly disconnected at the corners if openings for windows are left at those points. Again, if we are to suppose that there were open windows where the triglyphs now stand, it will follow, on the same principle, that the dentils of the Ionic order have likewise taken the places of windows. For the term "metope" is used of the intervals between dentils as well as of, LINE: 384, BOOK: The Ten Books on Architecture by Vitruvius, KEYWORD: cannot repres window erron said sinc corner middl column place natur case window build wholli disconnect corner open window left point suppos open window stand follow principl ionic order likewis taken place window term metop use interv well

TEXT: 5. The system of triglyphs and mutules was invented for theDoric order, and similarly the scheme of dentils belongs to the Ionic, in which there are proper grounds for its use in buildings.

TEXT:  And so in Greek works nobody ever put dentils under mutules, as it is impossible that common rafters should be underneath principal rafters.

TEXT: CHAPTER IIIPROPORTIONS OF DORIC TEMPLES1. Some of the ancient architects said that the Doric orderought not to be used for temples, because faults and incongruities were caused by the laws of its symmetry. Arcesius and Pytheos said so, as well as Hermogenes. He, for instance, after getting together a supply of marble for the construction of a Doric temple, changed his mind and built an Ionic temple to Father Bacchus with the same materials. This is not because it is unlovely in appearance or origin or dignity of form, but because the arrangement of the triglyphs and metopes (lacunaria) is an embarrassment and inconvenience to the work., LINE: 391, BOOK: The Ten Books on Architecture by Vitruvius, KEYWORD: chapter templ ancient architect said use templ fault incongru law symmetri said well instanc get togeth suppli marbl construct templ mind built ionic templ father materi unlov appear origin digniti form arrang lacunaria embarrass inconveni work

But in violation of this rule, at the corner columns triglyphs are placed at the outside edges and not corresponding to the centre of the columns. Hence the metopes next to the corner columns do not come out perfectly square, but are too broad by half the width of a triglyph. Those who would make the metopes all alike, make the outermost intercolumniations narrower by half the width of a triglyph. But the result is faulty, whether it is attained by broader metopes or narrower intercolumniations. For this reason, the ancients appear to have avoided the scheme of the Doric order in their temples., LINE: 392, BOOK: The Ten Books on Architecture by Vitruvius, KEYWORD: ought correspond column ought broad high violat rule corner column outsid edg correspond column henc next corner column come perfectli squar broad half width triglyph would make alik make outermost narrow half width triglyph result faulti whether narrow reason ancient appear scheme order templ

For their reduction will not be discernible, as the air has not free play about them. Still, in case they look too slender, when the outer columns have twenty or twenty-four flutes, these may have twenty-eight or thirty-two. Thus the additional number of flutes will make up proportionately for the loss in the body of the shaft, preventing it from being seen, and so in a different way the columns will be made to look equally thick., LINE: 410, BOOK: The Ten Books on Architecture by Vitruvius, KEYWORD: width forti foot let column insid opposit column height column front thick proportion reduc thu column front thick one eighth height one tenth former one ninth one tenth reduc proport reduct discern air ha free play still case look slender outer column twenti twenti four flute may twenti eight thirti two thu addit number flute make proportion loss bodi shaft seen differ way column made look equal thick

There are also circular temples, some of which areconstructed in monopteral form, surrounded by columns but without a cella, while others are termed peripteral. Those that are without a cella have a raised platform and a flight of steps leading to it, one third of the diameter of the temple. The columns upon the stylobates are constructed of a height equivalent to the diameter taken between the outer edges of the stylobate walls, and of a thickness equivalent to one tenth of their height including the capitals and bases. The architrave has the height of one half of the thickness of a column.

Temples of this kind, like that of Castor in the Circus, were first built in Athens on the Acropolis, and in Attica at Sunium to Pallas Minerva. The proportions of them are not different, but the same as usual. For the length of their cellae is twice the width, as in other temples; but all that we regularly find in the fronts of others is in these transferred to the sides., LINE: 438, BOOK: The Ten Books on Architecture by Vitruvius, KEYWORD: also kind templ symmetr proport yet differ kind plan exampl templ castor district circu two grove still ingeni templ sacr grove column ad right left flank pronao templ kind like castor circu first built acropoli proport differ usual length cella twice width templ regularli find front transfer side

I could wish that circumstances made this as permissible in the case of our subject, so that the authority of the present treatise might be increased by amplifications; but this is not so easy as it may be thought. Writing on architecture is not like history or poetry. History is captivating to the reader from its very nature; for it holds out the hope of various novelties. Poetry, with its measures and metrical feet, its refinement in the arrangement of words, and the delivery in verse of the sentiments expressed by the several characters to one another, delights the feelings of the reader, and leads him smoothly on to the very end of the work., LINE: 445, BOOK: The Ten Books on Architecture by Vitruvius, KEYWORD: emperor set forth intellectu idea doctrin thu made great remark addit author write could wish circumst made permiss case subject author present treatis might amplif easi may thought write architectur like histori poetri histori captiv reader natur hold hope variou novelti poetri measur metric foot refin arrang word deliveri vers sentiment express sever charact one anoth delight feel reader lead smoothli end work

TEXT: 4. A cube is a body with sides all of equal breadth and theirsurfaces perfectly square. When thrown down, it stands firm and steady so long as it is untouched, no matter on which of its sides it has fallen, like the dice which players throw on the board. The Pythagoreans appear to have drawn their analogy from the cube, because the number of lines mentioned will be fixed firmly and steadily in the memory when they have once settled down, like a cube, upon a man's understanding. The Greek comic poets, also, divided their plays into parts by introducing a choral song, and by this partition on the principle of the cubes, they relieve the actor's speeches by such intermissions., LINE: 450, BOOK: The Ten Books on Architecture by Vitruvius, KEYWORD: cube bodi side equal breadth perfectli squar thrown stand firm steadi long untouch matter side ha fallen like dice player throw board appear drawn analog cube number line fix firmli steadili memori settl like cube upon man understand comic poet also divid play part choral song partit principl cube reliev actor speech intermiss
TEXT: 5. Since these rules, founded on the analogy of nature, werefollowed by our predecessors, and since I observe that I have to write on unusual subjects which many persons will find obscure, I have thought it best to write in short books, so that they may the more readily strike the understanding of the reader: for they will thus be easy to comprehend. I have also arranged them so that those in search of knowledge on a subject may not have to gather it from different places, but may find it in one complete treatment, with the various classes set forth each in a book by itself. Hence, Caesar, in the third and fourth books I gave the rules for temples; in this book I shall treat of the laying out of public places.

The columns, of unbroken height, measuring with their capitals fifty feet, and being each five feet thick, have behind them pilasters, twenty feet high, two and one half feet broad, and one and one half feet thick, which support the beams on which is carried the upper flooring of the aisles. Above them are other pilasters, eighteen feet high, two feet broad, and a foot thick, which carry the beams supporting the principal raftering and the roof of the aisles, which is brought down lower than the main roof., LINE: 461, BOOK: The Ten Books on Architecture by Vitruvius, KEYWORD: wall column twenti foot broad column unbroken height measur capit fifti foot five foot thick behind pilast twenti foot high two one half foot broad one one half foot thick support beam carri upper floor aisl pilast eighteen foot high two foot broad foot thick carri beam support princip roof aisl brought lower main roof

The columns are: on the breadth of the main roof at each end, four, including the corner columns at right and left; on the long side which is next to the forum, eight, including the same corner columns; on the other side, six, including the corner columns. This is because the two middle columns on that side are omitted, in order not to obstruct the view of the pronaos of the temple of Augustus (which is built at the middle of the side wall of the basilica, facing the middle of the forum and the temple of Jupiter) and also the tribunal which is in the former temple, shaped as a hemicycle whose curvature is less than a semicircle., LINE: 462, BOOK: The Ten Books on Architecture by Vitruvius, KEYWORD: space beam column left window column breadth main roof end four corner column right left long side next forum eight corner column side six corner column two middl column side order obstruct view pronao templ built middl side wall basilica face middl forum templ also tribun former templ shape hemicycl whose curvatur less semicircl

The open side of this hemicycle is forty-six feet along thefront, and its curvature inwards is fifteen feet, so that those who are standing before the magistrates may not be in the way of the business men in the basilica.

Above the architraves and regularly dispersed on supportsdirectly over the capitals, piers are placed, three feet high and four feet broad each way. Above them is placed the projecting cornice round about, made of two two-foot timbers. The tie- beams and struts, being placed above them, and directly over the shafts of the columns and the antae and walls of the pronaos, hold up one gable roof along the entire basilica, and another from the middle of it, over the pronaos of the temple., LINE: 464, BOOK: The Ten Books on Architecture by Vitruvius, KEYWORD: pronao touch edg hemicycl right left basilica basilica architrav regularli dispers capit pier three foot high four foot broad way project cornic round made two two foot timber tie beam strut directli shaft column wall pronao hold one gabl roof along entir basilica anoth middl pronao templ

After the forum has been arranged, next, for the purpose ofseeing plays or festivals of the immortal gods, a site as healthy as possible should be selected for the theatre, in accordance with what has been written in the first book, on the principles of healthfulness in the sites of cities. For when plays are given, the spectators, with their wives and children, sit through them spell- bound, and their bodies, motionless from enjoyment, have the pores open, into which blowing winds find their way. If these winds come from marshy districts or from other unwholesome quarters, they will introduce noxious exhalations into the system.

Hence the ancient architects, following in the footsteps ofnature, perfected the ascending rows of seats in theatres from their investigations of the ascending voice, and, by means of the canonical theory of the mathematicians and that of the musicians, endeavoured to make every voice uttered on the stage come with greater clearness and sweetness to the ears of the audience. For just as musical instruments are brought to perfection of clearness in the sound of their strings by means of bronze plates or horn ἡχεια, so the ancients devised methods of increasing the power of the voice in theatres through the application of harmonics., LINE: 479, BOOK: The Ten Books on Architecture by Vitruvius, KEYWORD: henc ancient architect follow footstep perfect ascend row seat investig ascend voic mean canon theori mathematician musician make everi voic stage come greater clear sweet ear audienc music instrument brought perfect clear sound string mean bronz plate horn ancient method increas power voic applic harmon

If we desire to treat of it, we must use Greek words, because some of them have no Latin equivalents.

TEXT: 2. The voice, in its changes of position when shifting pitch,becomes sometimes high, sometimes low, and its movements are of two kinds, in one of which its progress is continuous, in the other by intervals. The continuous voice does not become stationary at the "boundaries" or at any definite place, and so the extremities of its progress are not apparent, but the fact that there are differences of pitch is apparent, as in our ordinary speech in sol, lux, flos, vox; for in these cases we cannot tell at what pitch the voice begins, nor at what pitch it leaves off, but the fact that it becomes low from high and high from low is apparent to the ear. In its progress by intervals the opposite is the case. For here, when the pitch shifts, the voice, by change of position, stations itself on one pitch, then on another, and, as it frequently repeats this alternating process, it appears to the senses to become stationary, as happens in singing when we, LINE: 481, BOOK: The Ten Books on Architecture by Vitruvius, KEYWORD: voic chang posit shift pitch becom sometim high sometim low movement two kind one progress continu interv continu voic doe becom stationari boundari definit place extrem progress appar fact differ pitch appar ordinari speech sol lux case cannot tell pitch voic begin pitch leaf fact becom low high high low appar ear progress interv opposit case pitch shift voic chang posit station one pitch anoth frequent repeat altern process becom stationari sing

In each class there are eighteen notes, termed in Greekφθὁλλοι, of which eight in all the three classes are constant and fixed, while the other ten, not being tuned to the same pitch, are variable. The fixed notes are those which, being placed between the moveable, make up the unity of the tetrachord, and remain unaltered in their boundaries according to the different classes.

These notes, from being moveable, take on differentqualities; for they may stand at different intervals and increasing distances. Thus, parhypate, which in the enharmonic is at the interval of half a semitone from hypate, has a semitone interval when transferred to the chromatic. What is called lichanos in the enharmonic is at the interval of a semitone from hypate; but when shifted to the chromatic, it goes two semitones away; and in the diatonic it is at an interval of three semitones from hypate.

This may be observed from the behaviour of those who sing to the lyre, who, when they wish to sing in a higher key, turn towards the folding doors on the stage, and thus by their aid are reinforced with a sound in harmony with the voice.

The plan of the theatre itself is to be constructed as follows.Having fixed upon the principal centre, draw a line ofcircumference equivalent to what is to be the perimeter at the bottom, and in it inscribe four equilateral triangles, at equal distances apart and touching the boundary line of the circle, as the astrologers do in a figure of the twelve signs of the zodiac, when they are making computations from the musical harmony of the stars. Taking that one of these triangles whose side is nearest to the scaena, let the front of the scaena be determined by the line where that side cuts off a segment of the circle (A- B), and draw, through the centre, a parallel line (C-D) set off from that position, to separate the platform of the stage from the space of the orchestra., LINE: 508, BOOK: The Ten Books on Architecture by Vitruvius, KEYWORD: chapter plan fix upon princip draw line equival perimet bottom inscrib four equilater triangl equal distanc apart touch boundari line circl astrolog figur twelv sign zodiac make comput music harmoni star take one triangl whose side nearest let front determin line side cut segment circl draw parallel line set posit separ platform stage space orchestra

The height of this platform must be not more than five feet, in order that those who sit in the orchestra may be able to see the performances of all the actors. The sections (cunei) for spectators in the theatre should be so divided, that the angles of the triangles which run about the circumference of the circle may give the direction for the flights of steps between the sections, as far as up to the first curved cross-aisle.

Let the columns above this parapet be one fourth less in height than the columns below, and the architraves and ornaments of these columns one fifth of their height.

It is not possible, however, that in all theatres these rules ofsymmetry should answer all conditions and purposes, but the architect ought to consider to what extent he must follow the principle of symmetry, and to what extent it may be modified to suit the nature of the site or the size of the work. There are, of course, some things which, for utility's sake, must be made of the same size in a small theatre, and a large one: such as the steps, curved cross-aisles, their parapets, the passages, stairways, stages, tribunals, and any other things which occur that make it necessary to give up symmetry so as not to interfere with utility.

They call this the λογεἱον, for the reason that there the tragic and comic actors perform on the stage, while other artists give their performances in the entire orchestra; hence, from this fact they are given in Greek the distinct names "Scenic" and "Thymelic." The height of this "logeum" ought to be not less than ten feet nor more than twelve. Let the ascending flights of steps between the wedges of seats, as far up as the first curved cross-aisle, be laid out on lines directly opposite to the angles of the squares. Above the cross-aisle, let other flights be laid out in the middle between the first; and at the top, as often as there is a new cross-aisle, the number of flights of steps is always increased to the same extent., LINE: 521, BOOK: The Ten Books on Architecture by Vitruvius, KEYWORD: result plan three orchestra set back well stage less depth call reason tragic comic actor perform stage artist give perform entir orchestra henc fact given distinct name scenic thymel height logeum ought less ten foot twelv let ascend flight step wedg seat far first curv cross aisl laid line directli opposit angl squar cross aisl let flight laid middl first top often new cross aisl number flight step alway extent
TEXT: CHAPTER VIIIACOUSTICS OF THE SITE OF A THEATRE1. All this having been settled with the greatest pains and skill,we must see to it, with still greater care, that a site has been selected where the voice has a gentle fall, and is not driven back with a recoil so as to convey an indistinct meaning to the ear.

The dissonant are those places in which the first sound uttered that is carried up high, strikes against solid bodies above, and, being driven back, checks as it sinks to the bottom the rise of the succeeding sound., LINE: 523, BOOK: The Ten Books on Architecture by Vitruvius, KEYWORD: cours voic instanc disson reson conson call disson place first sound carri high strike solid bodi driven back check sink bottom rise succeed sound
TEXT: 2. The circumsonant are those in which the voice spreads allround, and then is forced into the middle, where it dissolves, the case-endings are not heard, and it dies away there in sounds of indistinct meaning. The resonant are those in which it comes into contact with some solid substance and recoils, thus producing an echo, and making the terminations of cases sound double. The consonant are those in which it is supported from below, increases as it goes up, and reaches the ears in words which are distinct and clear in tone. Hence, if there has been careful attention in the selection of the site, the effect of the voice will, through this precaution, be perfectly suited to the purposes of a theatre., LINE: 524, BOOK: The Ten Books on Architecture by Vitruvius, KEYWORD: voic spread forc middl dissolv case end away sound indistinct mean reson come contact solid substanc recoil thu echo make termin case sound doubl conson increas go reach ear word distinct clear tone henc ha care attent select site effect voic precaut perfectli purpos

TEXT: CHAPTER IXCOLONNADES AND WALKS1. Colonnades must be constructed behind the scaena, so thatwhen sudden showers interrupt plays, the people may have somewhere to retire from the theatre, and so that there may be room for the preparation of all the outfit of the stage. Such places, for instance, are the colonnades of Pompey, and also, in Athens, the colonnades of Eumenes and the fane of Father Bacchus; also, as you leave the theatre, the music hall which Themistocles surrounded with stone columns, and roofed with the yards and masts of ships captured from the Persians. It was burned during the war with Mithridates, and afterwards restored by King Ariobarzanes. At Smyrna there is the Stratoniceum, at Tralles, a colonnade on each side of the scaena above the race course, and in other cities which have had careful architects there are colonnades and walks about the theatres., LINE: 526, BOOK: The Ten Books on Architecture by Vitruvius, KEYWORD: chapter walk colonnad must behind sudden shower interrupt play peopl may somewher retir may room prepar outfit stage place instanc colonnad pompey also colonnad father also leav music hall surround stone column yard mast ship wa burn war afterward king colonnad side race cours citi care architect colonnad walk

Hence, if the columns are to be of the Doric order, let their height, including the capital, be measured off into fifteen parts. Of these parts, let one be fixed upon to form the module, and in accordance with this module the whole work is to be developed. Let the thickness of the columns at the bottom be two modules; an intercolumniation, five and a half modules; the height of a column, excluding the capital, fourteen modules; the capital, one module in height and two and one sixth modules in breadth.

If the column is to be Corinthian, let its shaft and base be proportioned as in the Ionic, but its capital, as has been written in the fourth book. In the stylobates, let the increase made there by means of the "scamilli impares" be taken from the description written above in the third book.

TEXT: 5. The space in the middle, between the colonnades and opento the sky, ought to be embellished with green things; for walking in the open air is very healthy, particularly for the eyes, since the refined and rarefied air that comes from green things, finding its way in because of the physical exercise, gives a clean-cut image, and, by clearing away the gross humours from the eyes, leaves the sight keen and the image distinct. Besides, as the body gets warm with exercise in walking, this air, by sucking out the humours from the frame, diminishes their superabundance, and disperses and thus reduces that superfluity which is more than the body can bear., LINE: 530, BOOK: The Ten Books on Architecture by Vitruvius, KEYWORD: space middl colonnad sky ought green thing walk open air healthi particularli eye sinc refin air come green thing find way physic exercis give clean cut imag clear away gross humour eye leaf sight keen imag distinct besid bodi get warm exercis walk air suck humour frame superabund thu superflu bodi bear
TEXT: 6. That this is so may be seen from the fact that misty vapoursnever arise from springs of water which are under cover, nor even from watery marshes which are underground; but in uncovered places which are open to the sky, when the rising sun begins to act upon the world with its heat, it brings out the vapour from damp and watery spots, and rolls it in masses upwards. Therefore, if it appears that in places open to the sky the more noxious humours are sucked out of the body by the air, as they obviously are from the earth in the form of mists, I think there is no doubt that cities should be provided with the roomiest and most ornamented walks, laid out under the free and open sky., LINE: 531, BOOK: The Ten Books on Architecture by Vitruvius, KEYWORD: may seen fact misti aris spring water cover even wateri marsh underground uncov place open sky rise sun begin act upon world heat damp wateri spot roll mass upward therefor place open sky noxiou humour bodi air obvious earth form mist think doubt citi provid walk laid free open sky

Thus the entire vaulting will be completely supported on iron.

Next, although the building of palaestrae is not usual inItaly, I think it best to set forth the traditional way, and to show how they are constructed among the Greeks. The square or oblong peristyle in a palaestra should be so formed that the circuit of it makes a walk of two stadia, a distance which the Greeks call the δἱανλος. Let three of its colonnades be single, but let the fourth, which is on the south side, be double, so that when there is bad weather accompanied by wind, the drops of rain may not be able to reach the interior., LINE: 550, BOOK: The Ten Books on Architecture by Vitruvius, KEYWORD: chapter palaestra next although build usual think best set forth tradit way show among squar oblong peristyl palaestra form circuit make walk two stadium distanc call let three colonnad singl let fourth south side doubl bad weather wind drop rain may abl reach interior

Then, upon this level surface construct a block as large as is required, and when it is finished, leave it for not less than two months to dry. Then, cut away the marginal wall which supports the sand. Thus, the sand will be undermined by the waves, and this will cause the block to fall into the sea.

It is related of the Socratic philosopher Aristippus that,being shipwrecked and cast ashore on the coast of the Rhodians, he observed geometrical figures drawn thereon, and cried out to his companions: "Let us be of good cheer, for I see the traces of man." With that he made for the city of Rhodes, and went straight to the gymnasium. There he fell to discussing philosophical subjects, and presents were bestowed upon him, so that he could not only fit himself out, but could also provide those who accompanied him with clothing and all other necessaries of life. When his companions wished to return to their country, and asked him what message he wished them to carry home, he bade them say this: that children ought to be provided with property and resources of a kind that could swim with them even out of a shipwreck., LINE: 567, BOOK: The Ten Books on Architecture by Vitruvius, KEYWORD: proport relat philosoph cast ashor coast geometr figur drawn thereon cri companion let good cheer see trace man made citi went straight gymnasium fell philosoph subject present upon could fit could also provid cloth necessari life companion wish return countri messag wish carri home bade say child ought provid properti resourc kind could swim even shipwreck

TEXT: 3. And Epicurus, in much the same way, says that the wiseowe little to fortune; all that is greatest and essential is under the direction of the thinking power of the mind and the understanding. Many other philosophers have said the same thing. Likewise the poets who wrote the ancient comedies in Greek have expressed the same sentiments in their verses on the stage: for example, Eucrates, Chionides, Aristophanes, and with them Alexis in particular, who says that the Athenians ought to be praised for the reason that, while the laws of all Greeks require the maintenance of parents by their children, the laws of the Athenians require this only in the case of those who have educated their children in the arts. All the gifts which fortune bestows she can easily take away; but education, when combined with intelligence, never fails, but abides steadily on to the very end of life., LINE: 570, BOOK: The Ten Books on Architecture by Vitruvius, KEYWORD: much way say littl fortun essenti direct think power mind understand mani philosoph said thing likewis poet wrote ancient comedi express sentiment vers stage exampl particular say ought reason law requir mainten parent child law requir case educ child art gift fortun easili take away educ combin intellig never steadili end life

TEXT:  And it is not to be wondered at that I am so generally unknown.

Nobody, therefore, attempts to practise any other art in hisown home—as, for instance, the shoemaker's, or the fuller's, or any other of the easier kinds—but only architecture, and this is because the professionals do not possess the genuine art but term themselves architects falsely. For these reasons I have thought proper to compose most carefully a complete treatise on architecture and its principles, believing that it will be no unacceptable gift to all the world. In the fifth book I have said what I had to say about the convenient arrangement of public works; in this I shall set forth the theoretical principles and the symmetrical proportions of private houses., LINE: 579, BOOK: The Ten Books on Architecture by Vitruvius, KEYWORD: nobodi therefor attempt art home instanc shoemak fuller easier kind architectur profession possess genuin art term architect fals reason thought proper compos care complet treatis architectur principl believ unaccept gift world fifth book said say conveni arrang public work shall set forth theoret principl symmetr proport privat hous
TEXT: CHAPTER ION CLIMATE AS DETERMINING THE STYLE OF THE HOUSE1. If our designs for private houses are to be correct, we mustat the outset take note of the countries and climates in which they are built. One style of house seems appropriate to build in Egypt, another in Spain, a different kind in Pontus, one still different in Rome, and so on with lands and countries of other characteristics. This is because one part of the earth is directly under the sun's course, another is far away from it, while another lies midway between these two. Hence, as the position of the heaven with regard to a given tract on the earth leads naturally to different characteristics, owing to the inclination of the circle of the zodiac and the course of the sun, it is obvious that designs for houses ought similarly to conform to the nature of the country and to diversities of climate., LINE: 580, BOOK: The Ten Books on Architecture by Vitruvius, KEYWORD: chapter ion climat style hous design privat hous correct outset take note countri climat built one style hous appropri build anoth differ kind one still differ land countri characterist one part earth directli sun cours anoth far away anoth lie midway two henc posit heaven regard given tract earth lead natur differ characterist owe inclin circl zodiac cours sun obviou design hous ought similarli conform natur countri divers climat
TEXT: 2. In the north, houses should be entirely roofed over andsheltered as much as possible, not in the open, though having a warm exposure. But on the other hand, where the force of the sun is great in the southern countries that suffer from heat, houses must be built more in the open and with a northern or north-eastern exposure. Thus we may amend by art what nature, if left to herself, would mar. In other situations, also, we must make modifications to correspond to the position of the heaven and its effects on climate., LINE: 581, BOOK: The Ten Books on Architecture by Vitruvius, KEYWORD: north hous entir much possibl open though warm exposur hand forc sun great southern countri suffer heat hous must built open northern north eastern exposur thu may amend art natur left would mar situat also must make modif correspond posit heaven effect climat
TEXT: 3. These effects are noticeable and discernible not only inthings in nature, but they also are observable in the limbs and bodies of entire races. In places on which the sun throws out its heat in moderation, it keeps human bodies in their proper condition, and where its path is very close at hand, it parches them up, and burns out and takes away the proportion of moisture which they ought to possess. But, on the other hand, in the cold regions that are far away from the south, the moisture is not drawn out by hot weather, but the atmosphere is full of dampness which diffuses moisture into the system, and makes the frame larger and the pitch of the voice deeper. This is also the reason why the races that are bred in the north are of vast height, and have fair complexions, straight red hair, grey eyes, and a great deal of blood, owing to the abundance of moisture and the coolness of the atmosphere., LINE: 582, BOOK: The Ten Books on Architecture by Vitruvius, KEYWORD: effect notic discern natur also observ limb bodi entir race place sun throw heat moder keep human bodi proper condit path close hand burn take away proport moistur ought possess hand cold region far away south moistur drawn hot weather atmospher full damp moistur system make frame pitch voic also reason race bred north vast height fair complexion straight red hair grey eye great deal blood owe abund moistur cool atmospher
TEXT: 4. On the contrary, those that are nearest to the southern halfof the axis, and that lie directly under the sun's course, are of lower stature, with a swarthy complexion, hair curling, black eyes, strong legs, and but little blood on account of the force of the sun. Hence, too, this poverty of blood makes them over- timid to stand up against the sword, but great heat and fevers they can endure without timidity, because their frames are bred up in the raging heat. Hence, men that are born in the north are rendered over-timid and weak by fever, but their wealth of blood enables them to stand up against the sword without timidity., LINE: 583, BOOK: The Ten Books on Architecture by Vitruvius, KEYWORD: contrari nearest southern axi lie directli sun cours lower statur swarthi complexion hair curl black eye strong leg littl blood account forc sun henc poverti blood make timid stand sword great heat fever endur without timid frame bred rage heat henc men born north timid weak fever wealth blood stand sword without timid
TEXT: 5. The pitch of the voice islikewise different and varying in quality with different nations, for the following reasons. The terminating points east and west on the level of the earth, where the upper and lower parts of the heaven are divided, seem to lie in a naturally balanced circle which mathematicians call the Horizon. Keeping this idea definitely in mind, if we imagine a line drawn from the northern side of the circumference (N) to the side which lies above the southern half of the axis (S), and from here another line obliquely up to the pivot at the summit, beyond the stars composing the Great Bear (the pole star P), we shall doubtless see that we have in the heaven a triangular figure like that of the musical instrument which the Greeks call the "sambuca.", LINE: 584, BOOK: The Ten Books on Architecture by Vitruvius, KEYWORD: pitch voic differ qualiti differ nation follow reason point east west level earth upper lower part heaven divid seem lie natur balanc circl mathematician call horizon keep idea definit mind imagin line drawn northern side circumfer side lie southern half axi anoth line obliqu pivot summit beyond star great bear pole star shall doubtless see heaven triangular figur like music instrument call
TEXT: 6. And so, under the space which is nearest to the pivot at thebottom, off the southern portions of the line of the axis, are found nations that on account of the slight altitude of the heaven above them, have shrill and very high-pitched voices, like the string nearest to the angle in the musical instrument. Next in order come other nations as far as the middle of Greece, with lower elevations of the voice; and from this middle point they go on in regular order up to the extreme north, where, under high altitudes, the vocal utterance of the inhabitants is, under natural laws, produced in heavier tones. Thus it is obvious that the system of the universe as a whole is, on account of the, LINE: 585, BOOK: The Ten Books on Architecture by Vitruvius, KEYWORD: space nearest pivot southern portion line axi found nation account slight altitud heaven shrill high voic like string nearest angl music instrument next order come nation far middl lower elev voic middl point regular order extrem north high altitud vocal utter inhabit natur law produc tone thu obviou system univers whole account
TEXT: inclination of the heaven, composed in a most perfect harmony through the temporary power of the sun.7. The nations, therefore, that lie midway between the pivots atthe southern and the northern extremities of the axis, converse in a voice of middle pitch, like the notes in the middle of a musical scale; but, as we proceed towards the north, the distances to the heaven become greater, and so the nations there, whose vocal utterance is reduced by the moisture to the "hypatès" and to "proslambanomenon," are naturally obliged to speak in heavier tones. In the same way, as we proceed from the middle point to the south, the voices of the nations there correspond in extreme height of pitch and in shrillness to the "paranetès" and "netès.", LINE: 586, BOOK: The Ten Books on Architecture by Vitruvius, KEYWORD: inclin heaven compos perfect harmoni temporari power sun nation therefor lie midway pivot southern northern extrem axi convers voic middl pitch like note middl music scale proceed toward north distanc heaven becom greater nation whose vocal utter reduc moistur natur oblig speak tone way proceed middl point south voic nation correspond extrem height pitch shrill
TEXT: 8. That it is a fact that things are made heavier from being inplaces naturally moist, and higher pitched from places that are hot, may be proved from the following experiment. Take two cups which have been baked in the same oven for an equal time, which are of equal weight, and which give the same note when struck. Dip one of them into water and, after taking it out of water, strike them both. This done, there will be a great difference in their notes, and the cups can no longer be equal in weight. Thus it is with men: though born in the same general form and under the same all-embracing heaven, yet in some of them, on account of the heat in their country, the voice strikes the air on a high note, while in others, on account of abundance of moisture, the quality of tones produced is very heavy., LINE: 587, BOOK: The Ten Books on Architecture by Vitruvius, KEYWORD: fact thing made natur moist higher place hot may prove follow experi take two cup bake oven equal time equal weight give note struck dip one water take water strike done great differ note cup longer equal weight thu men though born gener form embrac heaven yet account heat countri voic strike air high note account abund moistur qualiti tone produc heavi
TEXT: 9. Further, it is owing to the rarity of the atmosphere thatsouthern nations, with their keen intelligence due to the heat, are very free and swift in the devising of schemes, while northern nations, being enveloped in a dense atmosphere, and chilled by moisture from the obstructing air, have but a sluggish, LINE: 588, BOOK: The Ten Books on Architecture by Vitruvius, KEYWORD: owe rariti atmospher nation keen intellig due heat free swift scheme northern nation dens atmospher chill moistur air sluggish
TEXT: intelligence. That this is so, we may see from the case of snakes. Their movements are most active in hot weather, when they have got rid of the chill due to moisture, whereas at the winter solstice, and in winter weather, they are chilled by the change of temperature, and rendered torpid and motionless. It is therefore no wonder that man's intelligence is made keener by warm air and duller by cold., LINE: 589, BOOK: The Ten Books on Architecture by Vitruvius, KEYWORD: intellig may see case snake movement activ hot weather got rid chill due moistur wherea winter solstic winter weather chill chang temperatur torpid motionless therefor wonder man intellig made keener warm air duller cold
TEXT: 10. But although southern nations have the keenest wits, andare infinitely clever in forming schemes, yet the moment it comes to displaying valour, they succumb because all manliness of spirit is sucked out of them by the sun. On the other hand, men born in cold countries are indeed readier to meet the shock of arms with great courage and without timidity, but their wits are so slow that they will rush to the charge inconsiderately and inexpertly, thus defeating their own devices. Such being nature's arrangement of the universe, and all these nations being allotted temperaments which are lacking in due moderation, the truly perfect territory, situated under the middle of the heaven, and having on each side the entire extent of the world and its countries, is that which is occupied by the Roman people., LINE: 590, BOOK: The Ten Books on Architecture by Vitruvius, KEYWORD: although southern nation wit infinit clever form scheme yet moment come succumb manli spirit sun hand men born cold countri inde meet shock arm great courag without timid wit slow rush charg inconsider inexpertli thu devic natur arrang univers nation tempera due moder truli perfect territori situat middl heaven side entir extent world countri peopl

Exactly as the planet Jupiter is itself temperate, its course lying midway between Mars, which is very hot, and Saturn, which is very cold, so Italy, lying between the north and the south, is a combination of what is found on each side, and her preëminence is well regulated and indisputable.

There is nothing to which an architect should devote morethought than to the exact proportions of his building with reference to a certain part selected as the standard.

In painted scenery, for example, columns may appear to jut out, mutules to project, and statues to be standing in the foreground, although the picture is of course perfectly flat. Similarly with ships, the oars when under the water are straight, though to the eye they appear to be broken. To the point where they touch the surface of the sea they look straight, as indeed they are, but when dipped under the water they emit from their bodies undulating images which come swimming up through the naturally transparent medium to the surface of the water, and, being there thrown into commotion, make the oars look broken., LINE: 596, BOOK: The Ten Books on Architecture by Vitruvius, KEYWORD: height anoth place still differ open case take much judgment decid done fact eye doe alway give true impress often lead mind form fals judgment paint sceneri exampl column may appear jut project statu stand foreground although pictur cours perfectli flat similarli ship oar water straight though eye appear broken point touch surfac sea look straight inde dip water emit bodi undul imag come swim natur transpar medium surfac water thrown commot make oar look broken

But in the case of exedrae or square oeci, let the height be brought up to one and one half times the width. Picture galleries, like exedrae, should be constructed of generous dimensions. Corinthian and tetrastyle oeci, as well as those termed Egyptian, should have the same symmetrical proportions in width and length as the dining rooms described above, but, since they have columns in them, their dimensions should be ampler., LINE: 617, BOOK: The Ten Books on Architecture by Vitruvius, KEYWORD: dine room ought twice long wide height oblong room calcul togeth measur length width take one half total result height case squar let height brought one one half time width pictur galleri like gener dimens tetrastyl well symmetr proport width length dine room sinc column dimens

The following will be the distinction between Corinthianand Egyptian oeci: the Corinthian have single tiers of columns,set either on a podium or on the ground, with architraves over them and coronae either of woodwork or of stucco, and carved vaulted ceilings above the coronae. In the Egyptian there are architraves over the columns, and joists laid thereon from the architraves to the surrounding walls, with a floor in the upper story to allow of walking round under the open sky. Then, above the architrave and perpendicularly over the lower tier of columns, columns one fourth smaller should be imposed. Above their architraves and ornaments are decorated ceilings, and the upper columns have windows set in between them. Thus the Egyptian are not like Corinthian dining rooms, but obviously resemble basilicas., LINE: 618, BOOK: The Ten Books on Architecture by Vitruvius, KEYWORD: follow distinct singl tier column set either podium ground architrav corona either woodwork stucco vault ceil corona architrav column joist laid thereon architrav surround wall floor upper stori allow walk round open sky architrav perpendicularli lower tier column column one fourth smaller architrav ornament decor ceil upper column window set thu like dine room obvious resembl basilica

These are built with a northern exposure and generally command a view of gardens, and have folding doors in the middle. They are also so long and so wide that two sets of dining couches, facing each other, with room to pass round them, can be placed therein. On the right and left they have windows which open like folding doors, so that views of the garden may be had from the dining couches through the opened windows.

Winter dining rooms and bathrooms should have a southwestern exposure, for the reason that they need the evening light, and also because the setting sun, facing them in all its splendour but with abated heat, lends a gentler warmth to that quarter in the evening. Bedrooms and libraries ought to have an eastern exposure, because their purposes require the morning light, and also because books in such libraries will not decay. In libraries with southern exposures the books are ruined by worms and dampness, because damp winds come up, which breed and nourish the worms, and destroy the books with mould, by spreading their damp breath over them., LINE: 622, BOOK: The Ten Books on Architecture by Vitruvius, KEYWORD: room requir differ exposur conveni quarter sky winter dine room bathroom southwestern exposur reason need even light also set sun face heat warmth quarter even bedroom librari ought eastern exposur purpos requir morn light also book librari decay librari southern exposur book ruin worm damp damp wind come breed nourish worm destroy book mould spread damp breath

TEXT: OWNER1. After settling the positions of the rooms with regard to thequarters of the sky, we must next consider the principles on which should be constructed those apartments in private houses which are meant for the householders themselves, and those which are to be shared in common with outsiders. The private rooms are those into which nobody has the right to enter without an invitation, such as bedrooms, dining rooms, bathrooms, and all others used for the like purposes. The common are those which any of the people have a perfect right to enter, even without an invitation: that is, entrance courts, cavaedia, peristyles, and all intended for the like purpose. Hence, men of everyday fortune do not need entrance courts, tablina, or atriums built in grand style, because such men are more apt to discharge their social obligations by going round to others than to have others come to them., LINE: 625, BOOK: The Ten Books on Architecture by Vitruvius, KEYWORD: owner settl posit room regard sky must next consid principl apart privat hous meant household common outsid privat room nobodi ha right enter without invit bedroom dine room bathroom use like purpos common peopl perfect right enter even without invit entranc court peristyl intend like purpos henc men everyday fortun need entranc court atrium built grand style men apt discharg social oblig go round come

TEXT: CHAPTER VITHE FARMHOUSEIn the first place, inspect the country from the point of view of health, in accordance with what is written in my first book, on the building of cities, and let your farmhouses be situated accordingly. Their dimensions should depend upon the size of the farm and the amount of produce. Their courtyards and the dimensions thereof should be determined by the number of cattle and the number of yokes of oxen that will need to be kept therein. Let the kitchen be placed on the warmest side of the courtyard, with the stalls for the oxen adjoining, and their cribs facing the kitchen fire and the eastern quarter of the sky, for the reason that oxen facing the light and the fire do not get rough-coated. Even peasants wholly without knowledge of the quarters of the sky believe that oxen ought to face only in the direction of the sunrise., LINE: 630, BOOK: The Ten Books on Architecture by Vitruvius, KEYWORD: chapter first place inspect countri point view health accord written first book build citi let farmhous situat accordingli dimens depend upon size farm amount produc courtyard dimens thereof determin number cattl number yoke ox need kept therein let kitchen side courtyard stall ox adjoin crib face kitchen fire eastern quarter sky reason ox face light fire get rough coat even peasant wholli without knowledg quarter sky believ ox ought face direct sunris

In dimensions, oil rooms should be built to accommodate the crop and the proper number of jars, each of which, holding about one hundred and twenty gallons, must take up a space four feet in diameter. The pressing room itself, if the pressure is exerted by means of levers and a beam, and not worked by turning screws, should be not less than forty feet long, which will give the lever man a convenient amount of space. It should be not less than sixteen feet wide, which will give the men who are at work plenty of free space to do the turning conveniently.

TEXT: 4. Folds for sheep and goats must be made large enough toallow each animal a space of not less than four and a half, nor more than six feet. Rooms for grain should be set in an elevated position and with a northern or north-eastern exposure. Thus the grain will not be able to heat quickly, but, being cooled by the wind, keeps a long time. Other exposures produce the corn weevil and the other little creatures that are wont to spoil the grain. To the stable should be assigned the very warmest place in the farmhouse, provided that it is not exposed to the kitchen fire; for when draught animals are stabled very near a fire, their coats get rough., LINE: 635, BOOK: The Ten Books on Architecture by Vitruvius, KEYWORD: fold sheep goat must made larg enough anim space less four half six foot room grain set elev posit northern north eastern exposur thu grain abl heat quickli wind keep long time exposur produc corn weevil littl creatur wont spoil grain stabl assign place farmhous provid expos kitchen fire draught anim near fire coat get rough

We must take care that all buildings are well lighted, butthis is obviously an easier matter with those which are on country estates, because there can be no neighbour's wall to interfere, whereas in town high party walls or limited space obstruct the light and make them dark. Hence we must apply the following test in this matter. On the side from which the light should be obtained let a line be stretched from the top of the wall that seems to obstruct the light to the point at which it ought to be introduced, and if a considerable space of open sky can be seen when one looks up above that line, there will be no obstruction to the light in that situation., LINE: 638, BOOK: The Ten Books on Architecture by Vitruvius, KEYWORD: must take care build well obvious easier matter countri estat wall interfer wherea town high parti wall limit space obstruct light make dark henc must appli follow test matter side light let line top wall obstruct light point ought consider space open sky seen one look line obstruct light situat

And as a general rule, we must arrange so as to leave places for windows on all sides on which a clear view of the sky can be had, for this will make our buildings light. Not only in dining rooms and other rooms for general use are windows very necessary, but also in passages, level or inclined, and on stairs; for people carrying burdens too often meet and run against each other in such places., LINE: 639, BOOK: The Ten Books on Architecture by Vitruvius, KEYWORD: timber way lintel make open higher introduc light way gener rule must arrang leav place window side clear view sky make build light dine room room gener use window necessari also passag level stair peopl carri burden often meet run place

Such apartments have fine entrance courts with imposing front doors of their own; the colonnades of the peristyles are decorated with polished stucco in relief and plain, and with coffered ceilings of woodwork; off the colonnades that face the north they have Cyzicene dining rooms and picture galleries; to the east, libraries; exedrae to the west; and to the south, large square rooms of such generous dimensions that four sets of dining couches can easily be arranged in them, with plenty of room for serving and for the amusements., LINE: 645, BOOK: The Ten Books on Architecture by Vitruvius, KEYWORD: connexion set sumptuou peristyl surround four colonnad equal height els one face south ha higher column peristyl ha one higher colonnad peristyl apart fine entranc court impos front door colonnad peristyl decor polish stucco relief plain ceil woodwork colonnad face north cyzicen dine room pictur galleri east librari west south larg squar room gener dimens four set dine couch easili plenti room serv amus

There are other similar instances as in the case of "xystus," "prothyrum," "telamones," and some others of the sort. As a Greek term, ξνστὁς means a colonnade of large dimensions in which athletes exercise in the winter time. But our people apply the term "xysta" to uncovered walks, which the Greeks call παραδρομἱδες.

Houses which are set level with the ground will no doubtlast to a great age, if their foundations are laid in the manner which we have explained in the earlier books, with regard to city walls and theatres. But if underground rooms and vaults are intended, their foundations ought to be thicker than the walls which are to be constructed in the upper part of the house, and the walls, piers, and columns of the latter should be set perpendicularly over the middle of the foundation walls below, so that they may have solid bearing; for if the load of the walls or columns rests on the middle of spans, they can have no permanent durability., LINE: 655, BOOK: The Ten Books on Architecture by Vitruvius, KEYWORD: refer durabl may built last great age without defect chapter foundat substructur hous set level ground great age foundat laid manner book regard citi wall underground room vault intend foundat ought wall upper part hous wall pier column latter set perpendicularli middl foundat wall may solid bear load wall column rest middl span perman durabl
TEXT: 2. It will also do no harm to insert posts between lintels andsills where there are piers or antae; for where the lintels and beams have received the load of the walls, they may sag in the middle, and gradually undermine and destroy the walls. But when there are posts set up underneath and wedged in there, they prevent the beams from settling and injuring such walls., LINE: 656, BOOK: The Ten Books on Architecture by Vitruvius, KEYWORD: also harm insert post lintel pier lintel beam receiv load wall may sag middl gradual undermin destroy wall post set underneath wedg prevent beam settl wall
TEXT: 3. We must also manage to discharge the load of the walls bymeans of archings composed of voussoirs with joints radiating to the centre. For when arches with voussoirs are sprung from the ends of beams, or from the bearings of lintels, in the first place they will discharge the load and the wood will not sag;, LINE: 657, BOOK: The Ten Books on Architecture by Vitruvius, KEYWORD: must also manag discharg load wall compos voussoir joint arch voussoir sprung end beam bear lintel first place discharg load wood sag
TEXT: secondly, if in course of time the wood becomes at all defective, it can easily be replaced without the construction of shoring.4. Likewise in houses where piers are used in the construction,when there are arches composed of voussoirs with joints radiating to the centre, the outermost piers at these points must be made broader than the others, so that they may have the strength to resist when the wedges, under the pressure of the load of the walls, begin to press along their joints towards the centre, and thus to thrust out the abutments. Hence, if the piers at the ends are of large dimensions, they will hold the voussoirs together, and make such works durable., LINE: 658, BOOK: The Ten Books on Architecture by Vitruvius, KEYWORD: secondli cours time wood becom defect easili without construct shore likewis hous pier use construct arch compos voussoir joint outermost pier point must made may strength resist wedg pressur load wall begin press along joint toward thu thrust abut henc pier end larg dimens hold voussoir togeth make work durabl
TEXT: 5. Having taken heed in these matters to see that properattention is paid to them, we must also be equally careful that all walls are perfectly vertical, and that they do not lean forward anywhere. Particular pains, too, must be taken with substructures, for here an endless amount of harm is usually done by the earth used as filling.

First, let the walls be given a thickness proportionate to the amount of filling; secondly, build counterforts or buttresses at the same time as the wall, on the outer side, at distances from each other equivalent to what is to be the height of the substructure and with the thickness of the substructure. At the bottom let them run out to a distance corresponding to the thickness that has been determined for the substructure, and then gradually diminish in extent so that at the surface their projection is equal to the thickness of the wall of the building., LINE: 660, BOOK: The Ten Books on Architecture by Vitruvius, KEYWORD: follow mean must taken provid defect first let wall given thick proportion amount fill secondli build buttress time wall outer side distanc equival height substructur thick substructur bottom let run distanc correspond thick ha determin substructur gradual diminish extent surfac project equal thick wall build

Furthermore, inside, to meet the mass of earth, there shouldbe saw-shaped constructions attached to the wall, the single teeth extending from the wall for a distance equivalent to what is to be the height of the substructure, and the teeth being constructed with the same thickness as the wall. Then at the outermost angles take a distance inwards, from the inside of the angle, equal to the height of the substructure, and mark it off on each side; from these marks build up a diagonal structure and from the middle of it a second, joined on to the angle of the wall. With this arrangement, the teeth and diagonal structures will not allow the filling to thrust with all its force against the wall, but will check and distribute the pressure., LINE: 661, BOOK: The Ten Books on Architecture by Vitruvius, KEYWORD: retain wall edit fra furthermor insid meet mass earth saw shape construct attach wall singl teeth extend wall distanc equival height substructur teeth thick wall outermost angl take distanc inward insid angl equal height substructur mark side mark build diagon structur middl second angl wall arrang teeth diagon structur allow fill thrust forc wall check distribut pressur

As for replacing tiles, roof timbers, and rafters, we need not be so particular about them as about the parts just mentioned, because they can easily be replaced, however defective they may become.

TEXT: 9. As for the kind of material to be used, this does not dependupon the architect, for the reason that all kinds of materials are not found in all places alike, as has been shown in the first book. Besides, it depends on the owner whether he desires to build in brick, or rubble work, or dimension stone. Consequently the question of approving any work may be considered under three heads: that is, delicacy of workmanship, sumptuousness, and design. When it appears that a work has been carried out sumptuously, the owner will be the person to be praised for the great outlay which he has authorized; when delicately, the master workman will be approved for his execution; but when proportions and symmetry lend it an imposing effect, then the glory of it will belong to the architect., LINE: 663, BOOK: The Ten Books on Architecture by Vitruvius, KEYWORD: kind materi use doe architect reason kind materi found place alik ha shown first book besid owner whether desir build brick rubbl work dimens stone consequ question work may consid three head delicaci workmanship sumptuous design work ha carri sumptuous owner person great outlay ha author delic master workman execut proport symmetri lend impos effect glori belong architect

In fact, all kinds of men, and not merely architects, can recognize a good piece of work, but between laymen and the latter there is this difference, that the layman cannot tell what it is to be like without seeing it finished, whereas the architect, as soon as he has formed the conception, and before he begins the work, has a definite idea of the beauty, the convenience, and the propriety that will distinguish it., LINE: 664, BOOK: The Ten Books on Architecture by Vitruvius, KEYWORD: result howev may well brought take advic workman layman fact kind men mere architect recogn good piec work layman latter differ layman cannot tell like without see finish wherea architect soon ha form concept begin work ha definit idea beauti conveni proprieti distinguish

It was a wise and useful provision of the ancients to transmittheir thoughts to posterity by recording them in treatises, so that they should not be lost, but, being developed in succeeding generations through publication in books, should gradually attain in later times, to the highest refinement of learning.

The kings of the house of Attalus having established, underthe influence of the great charms of literature, an excellent library at Pergamus to give pleasure to the public, Ptolemy also was aroused with no end of enthusiasm and emulation into exertions to make a similar provision with no less diligence at Alexandria. Having done so with the greatest care, he felt that this was not enough without providing for its increase and development, for which he sowed the seed. He established public contests in honour of the Muses and Apollo, and appointed prizes and honours for victorious authors in general, as is done in the case of athletes., LINE: 669, BOOK: The Ten Books on Architecture by Vitruvius, KEYWORD: king hous establish influenc great charm literatur excel librari give pleasur public also wa end enthusiasm emul exert make similar provis less dilig done care felt wa enough without provid increas develop seed establish public contest prize victori author gener done case athlet
TEXT: 5. These arrangements having been made, and the contestsbeing at hand, it became necessary to select literary men as judges to decide them. The king soon selected six of the citizens, but could not so easily find a proper person to be the seventh. He therefore turned to those who presided over the library, and asked whether they knew anybody who was suitable for the purpose. Then they told him that there was one Aristophanes who was daily engaged in reading through all the books with the greatest enthusiasm and the greatest care.

So, when they were individually asked for their votes, the six agreed, and awarded the first prize to the poet who, as they observed, had most pleased the multitude, and the second to the one who came next. But Aristophanes, on being asked for his vote, urged that the poet who had least pleased the audience should be declared to be the first., LINE: 672, BOOK: The Ten Books on Architecture by Vitruvius, KEYWORD: composit whole audienc applaus judg individu vote six agre first prize poet multitud second one came next vote poet least audienc declar first

Silence being obtained, he stated that only one of them— his man—was a poet, and that the rest had recited things not their own; furthermore, that judges ought to give their approval, not to thefts, but to original compositions. The people were amazed, and the king hesitated, but Aristophanes, trusting to his memory, had a vast number of volumes brought out from bookcases which he specified, and, by comparing them with what had been recited, obliged the thieves themselves to make confession. So, the king gave orders that they should be accused of theft, and after condemnation sent them off in disgrace; but he honoured Aristophanes with the most generous gifts, and put him in charge of the library., LINE: 673, BOOK: The Ten Books on Architecture by Vitruvius, KEYWORD: king entir assembl aros receiv permiss speak silenc state one man wa poet rest thing furthermor judg ought give approv theft origin composit peopl amaz king trust memori vast number volum brought bookcas oblig thief make confess king gave order accus theft condemn sent disgrac gener gift put charg librari

But it is said that the king replied, that Homer, though deada thousand years ago, had all that time been the means of livelihood for many thousands of men; similarly, a person who laid claim to higher genius ought to be able to support not one man only, but many others. And in short, various stories are told about his death, which was like that of one found guilty of parricide. Some writers have said that he was crucified by Philadelphus; others that he was stoned at Chios; others again that he was thrown alive upon a funeral pyre at Smyrna. Whichever of these forms of death befell him, it was a fitting punishment and his just due; for one who accuses men that cannot answer and show, face to face, what was the meaning of their writings, obviously deserves no other treatment., LINE: 676, BOOK: The Ten Books on Architecture by Vitruvius, KEYWORD: said king homer though thousand year ago time mean livelihood mani thousand men similarli person laid claim higher geniu ought abl support one man mani short variou stori told death wa like one found guilti parricid writer said wa crucifi wa stone wa thrown aliv upon funer pyre whichev form death wa fit punish due one men cannot answer show face face wa mean write obvious treatment

From their commentaries I have gathered what I saw was useful for the present subject, and formed it into one complete treatise, and this principally, because I saw that many books in this field had been published by the Greeks, but very few indeed by our countrymen.

To their great excellence and the wisdom of their conception they owe their place of esteem in the ceremonial worship of the gods. First there is the temple of Diana at Ephesus, in the Ionic style, undertaken by Chersiphron of Gnosus and his son Metagenes, and said to have been finished later by Demetrius, who was himself a slave of Diana, and by Paeonius the Milesian. At Miletus, the temple of Apollo, also Ionic in its proportions, was the undertaking of the same Paeonius and of the Ephesian Daphnis. At Eleusis, the cella of Ceres and Proserpine, of vast size, was completed to the roof by Ictinus in the Doric style, but without exterior columns and with plenty of room for the customary sacrifices., LINE: 685, BOOK: The Ten Books on Architecture by Vitruvius, KEYWORD: fact four place possess workmanship marbl caus class highest renown great excel wisdom concept owe place esteem ceremoni worship god first templ ionic style son said finish later wa slave templ also ionic proport wa undertak cella cere vast size wa roof style without exterior column plenti room customari sacrific

But Cossutius is not the only man by whom we should like to have writings on our subject. Another is Gaius Mucius, who, having great knowledge on which to rely, completed the cella, columns, and entablature of the Marian temple of Honour and Valour, in symmetrical proportions according to the accepted rules of the art.

This will be all right if the best lime, taken in lumps, is slaked a good while before it is to be used, so that if any lump has not been burned long enough in the kiln, it will be forced to throw off its heat during the long course of slaking in the water, and will thus be thoroughly burned to the same consistency. When it is taken not thoroughly slaked but fresh, it has little crude bits concealed in it, and so, when applied, it blisters.

TEXT: VAULTINGS AND STUCCO WORK1. When vaulting is required, the procedure should be asfollows. Set up horizontal furring strips at intervals of not more than two feet apart, using preferably cypress, as fir is soon spoiled by decay and by age. Arrange these strips so as to form a curve, and make them fast to the joists of the floor above or to the roof, if it is there, by nailing them with many iron nails to ties fixed at intervals. These ties should be made of a kind of wood that neither decay nor time nor dampness can spoil, such as box, juniper, olive, oak, cypress, or any other similar wood except common oak; for this warps, and causes cracks in work in which it is used., LINE: 705, BOOK: The Ten Books on Architecture by Vitruvius, KEYWORD: vault stucco work vault procedur set horizont fur strip interv two foot apart prefer cypress fir soon spoil decay age arrang strip form curv make fast joist floor roof nail mani iron nail tie fix interv tie made kind wood neither decay time damp spoil box junip oliv oak cypress similar wood except common oak warp caus crack work use
TEXT: 2. Having arranged the furring strips, take cord made ofSpanish broom, and tie Greek reeds, previously pounded flat, to them in the required contour. Immediately above the vaulting spread some mortar made of lime and sand, to check any drops that may fall from the joists or from the roof. If a supply of Greek reed is not to be had, gather slender marsh reeds, and make them up with silk cord into bundles all of the same thickness and adjusted to the proper length, provided that the bundles are not more than two feet long between any two knots., LINE: 706, BOOK: The Ten Books on Architecture by Vitruvius, KEYWORD: fur strip take cord made broom tie reed previous flat contour immedi vault spread mortar made lime sand check drop may fall joist roof suppli reed gather slender marsh reed make silk cord bundl thick proper length provid bundl two foot long two knot

After the vaultings have been polished, set the impost mouldings directly beneath them. These obviously ought to be made extremely slender and delicate, for when they are large, their weight carries them down, and they cannot support themselves. Gypsum should by no means be used in their composition, but powdered marble should be laid on uniformly, lest gypsum, by setting too quickly should keep the work from drying uniformly. We must also beware of the ancients' scheme for vaultings; for in their mouldings the soffits overhang very heavily, and are dangerous., LINE: 708, BOOK: The Ten Books on Architecture by Vitruvius, KEYWORD: appli render coat lower surfac lay sand mortar afterward polish powder marbl vault polish set impost directli beneath obvious ought made extrem slender delic larg weight carri cannot support gypsum mean use composit powder marbl laid uniformli lest gypsum set quickli keep work dri uniformli must also bewar ancient scheme vault soffit overhang heavili danger

When not less than three coats of sand mortar, besides therendering coat, have been laid on, then, we must make the mixture for the layers of powdered marble, the mortar being so tempered that when mixed it does not stick to the trowel, but the iron comes out freely and clean from the mortar trough. After this powdered marble has been spread on and gets dry, lay on a medium second coat. When that has been applied and well rubbed down, spread on a finer coat. The walls, being thus rendered solid by three coats of sand mortar and as many of marble, will not possibly be liable to cracks or to any other defect., LINE: 711, BOOK: The Ten Books on Architecture by Vitruvius, KEYWORD: foundat sand mortar laid durabl solid stucco less three coat sand mortar besid coat laid must make mixtur layer powder marbl mortar temper mix doe stick trowel iron come freeli clean mortar trough powder marbl ha spread get dri lay medium second coat ha appli well rub spread finer coat wall thu solid three coat sand mortar mani marbl possibl liabl crack defect

TEXT: These colours, when they are carefully laid on stucco still wet,do not fade but are permanent. This is because the lime, having had its moisture burned out in the kiln, becomes porous and loses its strength, and its dryness makes it take up anything that may come in contact with it.

The Greek stucco-workers not only employ these methodsto make their works durable, but also construct a mortar trough, mix the lime and sand in it, bring on a gang of men, and beat the stuff with wooden beetles, and do not use it until it has been thus vigorously worked. Hence, some cut slabs out of old walls and use them as panels, and the stucco of such panels and "reflectors" has projecting bevelled edges all round it., LINE: 716, BOOK: The Ten Books on Architecture by Vitruvius, KEYWORD: stucco worker employ make work durabl also construct mortar trough mix lime sand bring gang men beat stuff wooden beetl use ha thu vigor work henc cut slab old wall use panel stucco panel reflector ha project bevel edg round

In these paintings there are harbours, promontories, seashores, rivers, fountains, straits, fanes, groves, mountains, flocks, shepherds; in some places there are also pictures designed in the grand style, with figures of the gods or detailed mythological episodes, or the battles at Troy, or the wanderings of Ulysses, with landscape backgrounds, and other subjects reproduced on similar principles from real life., LINE: 731, BOOK: The Ten Books on Architecture by Vitruvius, KEYWORD: form build column project pediment open room account size facad scene tragic comic satyr style walk account great length decor varieti landscap characterist definit spot paint harbour promontori seashor river fountain strait grove mountain flock shepherd place also pictur design grand style figur god detail mytholog episod battl troy wander landscap background subject similar principl real life

However, it may not be out of place to explain why this false method prevails over the truth.

TEXT: 4. Quicksilver is a useful thing for many purposes. Forinstance, neither silver nor copper can be gilded properly without it. And when gold has been woven into a garment, and the garment becomes worn out with age so that it is no longer respectable to use, the pieces of cloth are put into earthen pots, and burned up over a fire. The ashes are then thrown into water and quicksilver added thereto. This attracts all the bits of gold, and makes them combine with itself. The water is then poured off, and the rest emptied into a cloth and squeezed in the hands, whereupon the quicksilver, being a liquid, escapes through the loose texture of the cloth, but the gold, which has been brought together by the squeezing, is found inside in a pure state., LINE: 751, BOOK: The Ten Books on Architecture by Vitruvius, KEYWORD: quicksilv use thing mani purpos neither silver copper gild properli without gold ha woven garment garment becom worn age longer respect use piec cloth put earthen pot burn fire ash thrown water quicksilv ad thereto bit gold make combin water rest cloth hand whereupon quicksilv liquid escap loos textur cloth gold ha brought togeth squeez found insid pure state

When thelumps of ore are dry, they are crushed in iron mortars, andrepeatedly washed and heated until the impurities are gone, and the colours come.

Hence, though it keeps its colour perfectly when applied inthe polished stucco finish of closed apartments, yet in open apartments, such as peristyles or exedrae or other places of the sort, where the bright rays of the sun and moon can penetrate, it is spoiled by contact with them, loses the strength of its colour, and turns black. Among many others, the secretary Faberius, who wished to have his house on the Aventine finished in elegant style, applied vermilion to all the walls of the peristyle; but after thirty days they turned to an ugly and mottled colour. He therefore made a contract to have other colours applied instead of vermilion., LINE: 753, BOOK: The Ten Books on Architecture by Vitruvius, KEYWORD: henc though keep colour perfectli appli polish stucco finish close apart yet open apart peristyl place sort bright ray sun moon penetr spoil contact strength colour turn black among mani secretari wish hous finish eleg style appli vermilion wall peristyl thirti day turn ugli mottl colour therefor made contract colour appli instead vermilion

But anybody who is more particular, and who wants apolished finish of vermilion that will keep its proper colour, should, after the wall has been polished and is dry, apply with a brush Pontic wax melted over a fire and mixed with a little oil; then after this he should bring the wax to a sweat by warming it and the wall at close quarters with charcoal enclosed in an iron vessel; and finally he should smooth it all off by rubbing it down with a wax candle and clean linen cloths, just as naked marble statues are treated., LINE: 754, BOOK: The Ten Books on Architecture by Vitruvius, KEYWORD: anybodi particular want finish vermilion keep proper colour wall ha polish dri appli brush pontic wax melt fire mix littl oil bring wax sweat warm wall close quarter charcoal iron vessel final smooth rub wax candl clean linen cloth nake marbl statu

Take an iron plate, put the cinnabar upon it, and lay it on the fire until the plate gets red hot. When the glowing heat makes the colour change and turn black, remove the plate from the fire, and if the cinnabar when cooled returns to its former colour, it will be proved to be unadulterated; but if it keeps the black colour, it will show that it has been adulterated., LINE: 757, BOOK: The Ten Books on Architecture by Vitruvius, KEYWORD: cinnabar lime henc proceed one wish prove unadulter take iron plate put cinnabar upon lay fire plate get red hot glow heat make colour chang turn black remov plate fire cinnabar return former colour prove unadulter keep black colour show ha

In front of it, a small furnace is constructed with vents into the Laconicum, and with a stokehole that can be very carefully closed to prevent the flames from escaping and being wasted. Resin is placed in the furnace. The force of the fire in burning it compels it to give out soot into the Laconicum through the vents, and the soot sticks to the walls and the curved vaulting. It is gathered from them, and some of it is mixed and worked with gum for use as writing ink, while the rest is mixed with size, and used on walls by fresco painters., LINE: 760, BOOK: The Ten Books on Architecture by Vitruvius, KEYWORD: place built like laconicum nice finish smoothli polish front small furnac vent laconicum stokehol care close prevent flame wast resin furnac forc fire burn give soot laconicum vent soot stick wall curv vault mix work gum use write ink rest mix size use wall fresco painter

TEXT: CHAPTER XIBLUE. BURNT OCHRE1. Methods of making blue were first discovered inAlexandria, and afterwards Vestorius set up the making of it atPuzzuoli. The method of obtaining it from the substances of which it has been found to consist, is strange enough. Sand and the flowers of natron are brayed together so finely that the product is like meal, and copper is grated by means of coarse files over the mixture, like sawdust, to form a conglomerate. Then it is made into balls by rolling it in the hands and thus bound together for drying. The dry balls are put in an earthern jar, and the jars in an oven. As soon as the copper and the sand grow hot and unite under the intensity of the fire, they mutually receive each other's sweat, relinquishing their peculiar qualities, and having lost their properties through the intensity of the fire, they are reduced to a blue colour., LINE: 763, BOOK: The Ten Books on Architecture by Vitruvius, KEYWORD: chapter burnt method make blue first discov afterward set make method substanc ha found consist strang enough sand flower natron togeth fine product like meal copper mean coars file mixtur like sawdust form conglomer made ball roll hand thu bound togeth dri dri ball put jar jar oven soon copper sand grow hot unit intens fire mutual receiv sweat peculiar qualiti lost properti intens fire reduc blue colour

Before sunrise, lie down flat in the place where the search is to be made, and placing the chin on the earth and supporting it there, take a look out over the country. In this way the sight will not range higher than it ought, the chin being immovable, but will range over a definitely limited height on the same level through the country.

That this is the state of the case may be proved by thesources of rivers, the majority and the longest of which, as drawn and described in geographies of the world, are found to rise in the north. First in India, the Ganges and Indus spring from the Caucasus; in Syria, the Tigris and Euphrates; in Pontus in Asia, the Dnieper, Bug, and Don; in Colchis, the Phasis; in Gaul, the Rhone; in Celtica, the Rhine; on this side of the Alps, the Timavo and Po; in Italy, the Tiber; in Maurusia, which we call Mauretania, the Dyris, rising in the Atlas range and running westerly to Lake Heptagonus, where it changes its name and is called Agger; then from Lake Heptabolus it runs at the base of barren mountains, flowing southerly and emptying into the marsh called[10]...

Therefore, since in descriptions of the world it appears thatall rivers of any size flow from the north, and since in the plains of Africa, which are exposed to the course of the sun in the south, the moisture is deeply hidden, springs not common, and rivers rare, it follows that the sources of springs which lie to the north or northeast are much better, unless they hit upon a place which is full of sulphur, alum, or asphalt.

TEXT: 9. The fact is, heat is not at all a property of water, but when astream of cold water happens upon a hot place, it boils up, and issues through the fissures and out of the ground in a state of heat. This cannot last very long, but in a short time the water becomes cold. If it were naturally hot, it would not cool off and lose its heat. Its taste, however, and its smell and colour are not restored, because it has become saturated and compounded with these qualities on account of the rarity of its nature., LINE: 810, BOOK: The Ten Books on Architecture by Vitruvius, KEYWORD: fact heat properti water astream cold water upon hot place boil issu fissur ground state heat cannot last long short time water becom cold natur hot would cool lose heat tast howev smell colour ha becom satur qualiti account rariti natur
TEXT: CHAPTER IIIVARIOUS PROPERTIES OF DIFFERENT WATERS1. There are, however, some hot springs that supply water ofthe best taste, which is so delightful to drink that one does not think with regret of the Fountain of the Muses or the Marcian aqueduct. These hot springs are produced naturally, in the following manner. When fire is kindled down beneath in alum or asphalt or sulphur, it makes the earth immediately over it very hot, and emits a glowing heat to the parts still farther above it, so that if there are any springs of sweet water found in the upper strata, they begin to boil in their fissures when they are met by this heat, and so they run out with their taste unimpaired., LINE: 811, BOOK: The Ten Books on Architecture by Vitruvius, KEYWORD: chapter properti differ water howev hot spring suppli water best tast delight drink one doe think regret fountain aqueduct hot spring produc natur follow manner fire beneath alum asphalt sulphur make earth immedi hot glow heat part still farther spring sweet water found upper stratum begin boil fissur met heat run tast unimpair
TEXT: 2. And there are some cold springs that have a bad smell andtaste. They rise deep down in the lower strata, cross places which are on fire, and then are cooled by running a long distance through the earth, coming out above ground with their taste, smell, and colour spoiled; as, for instance, the river Albula on the road to Tivoli and the cold springs of Ardea, which have the same smell and are called sulphur springs, and others in similar places. Although they are cold, yet at first sight they seem to be hot for the reason that when they happen upon a burning spot deep down below, the liquid and the fire meet, and with a great noise at the collision they take in strong currents of air, and thus, swollen by a quantity of compressed wind, they come out at the springs in a constant state of ebullition. When such springs are not open but confined by rocks, the force of the air in them drives them up through the narrow fissures to the summits of hills., LINE: 812, BOOK: The Ten Books on Architecture by Vitruvius, KEYWORD: cold spring bad smell rise deep lower stratum cross place fire run long distanc earth come ground tast smell colour spoil instanc river road tivoli cold spring smell sulphur spring similar place although cold yet first sight seem hot reason happen upon burn spot deep liquid fire meet great nois collis take strong current air thu swollen quantiti compress wind come spring constant state ebullit spring open confin rock forc air drive narrow fissur summit hill
TEXT: 3. Consequently those who think that they have excavatedsources of springs at the height of such hills find themselves mistaken when they open up their excavations.

TEXT:  When it is subjected to a very hot fire, the water must become thoroughly heated, and from the rarity of its nature it greatly expands by taking in the heat, so that it not only fills the vase but raises its cover by means of the currents of air in it, and swells and runs over., LINE: 814, BOOK: The Ten Books on Architecture by Vitruvius, KEYWORD: subject hot fire water must becom thoroughli rariti natur greatli take heat fill vase rais cover mean current air swell run
TEXT:  But if you take the cover off, the expanding forces are released into the open air, and the water settles down again to its proper level. So it is with the sources of springs. As long as they are confined in narrow channels, the currents of air in the water rush up in bubbles to the top, but as soon as they are given a wider outlet, they lose their air on account of the rarity peculiar to water, and so settle down and resume their proper level., LINE: 815, BOOK: The Ten Books on Architecture by Vitruvius, KEYWORD: take cover expand forc open air water settl proper level sourc spring long confin narrow channel current air water rush bubbl top soon given outlet lose air account rariti peculiar water settl resum proper level

For example, sulphur springs cure pains in the sinews, by warming up and burning out the corrupt humours of the body by their heat. Aluminous springs, used in the treatment of the limbs when enfeebled by paralysis or the stroke of any such malady, introduce warmth through the open pores, counter- acting the chill by the opposite effect of their heat, and thus equably restoring the limbs to their former condition. Asphaltic springs, taken as purges, cure internal maladies., LINE: 817, BOOK: The Ten Books on Architecture by Vitruvius, KEYWORD: everi hot spring ha heal properti ha foreign substanc thu new use qualiti exampl sulphur spring cure pain sinew warm burn corrupt humour bodi heat alumin spring use treatment limb paralysi stroke maladi introduc warmth open pore counter act chill opposit effect heat thu equabl limb former condit asphalt spring taken purg cure intern maladi
TEXT: 5. There is also a kind of cold water containing natron, foundfor instance at Penne in the Vestine country, at Cutiliae, and at other similar places. It is taken as a purge and in passing throughthe bowels reduces scrofulous tumours. Copious springs are found where there are mines of gold, silver, iron, copper, lead, and the like, but they are very harmful. For they contain, like hot springs, sulphur, alum, asphalt,... and when it passes into the body in the form of drink, and spreading through the veins reaches the sinews and joints, it expands and hardens them. Hence the sinews, swelling with this expansion, are contracted in length and so give men the cramp or the gout, for the reason that their veins are saturated with very hard, dense, and cold substances., LINE: 818, BOOK: The Ten Books on Architecture by Vitruvius, KEYWORD: also kind cold water natron instanc countri similar place taken purg pass bowel scroful copiou spring found mine gold silver iron copper lead like harm contain like hot spring sulphur alum asphalt pass bodi form drink spread vein reach sinew joint henc sinew swell expans contract length give men cramp gout reason vein satur hard dens cold substanc
TEXT: 6. There is also a sort of water which, since it contains... thatare not perfectly clear, and it floats like a flower on the surface, in colour like purple glass. This may be seen particularly in Athens, where there are aqueducts from places and springs of that sort leading to the city and the port of Piraeus, from which nobody drinks, for the reason mentioned, but they use them for bathing and so forth, and drink from wells, thus avoiding their unwholesomeness. At Troezen it cannot be avoided, because no other kind of water at all is found, except what the Cibdeli furnish, and so in that city all or most of the people have diseases of the feet. At the city of Tarsus in Cilicia is a river named Cydnus, in which gouty people soak their legs and find relief from pain., LINE: 819, BOOK: The Ten Books on Architecture by Vitruvius, KEYWORD: also sort water sinc perfectli clear float like flower surfac colour like purpl glass may seen particularli aqueduct place spring sort lead citi port nobodi drink reason use bath forth drink well thu unwholesom cannot kind water found except furnish citi peopl diseas foot citi tarsu river gouti peopl soak leg find relief pain

TEXT: 9. There is nothing marvellous in this, for quarries of hardasphalt are numerous there. So, when a quantity of water bursts its way through the asphaltic soil, it carries asphalt out with it, and after passing out of the ground, the water is separated and so rejects the asphalt from itself. Again, in Cappadocia on the road from Mazaca to Tyana, there is an extensive lake into which if a part of a reed or of some other thing be plunged, and withdrawn the next day, it will be found that the part thus withdrawn has, LINE: 826, BOOK: The Ten Books on Architecture by Vitruvius, KEYWORD: noth quarri numer quantiti water burst way asphalt soil carri asphalt pass ground water reject asphalt road extens lake part reed thing withdrawn next day found part thu withdrawn ha

In the same way, at Hierapolis in Phrygia there is amultitude of boiling hot springs from which water is let into ditches surrounding gardens and vineyards, and this water becomes an incrustation of stone at the end of a year. Hence, every year they construct banks of earth to the right and left, let in the water, and thus out of these incrustations make walls for their fields. This seems due to natural causes, since there is a juice having a coagulating potency like rennet underground in those spots and in that country. When this potency appears above ground mingled with spring water, the mixture cannot but be hardened by the heat of the sun and air, as appears in salt pits., LINE: 827, BOOK: The Ten Books on Architecture by Vitruvius, KEYWORD: turn stone part water origin natur way boil hot spring water let ditch surround garden vineyard water becom incrust stone end year henc everi year construct bank earth right left let water thu incrust make wall field due natur caus sinc juic potenc like rennet underground spot countri potenc ground spring water mixtur cannot heat sun air salt pit

For about forty miles from its source its taste is very sweet; then it reaches a point about one hundred and sixty miles from its mouth, where it is joined by a very small brook. This runs into it, and at once makes that vast river bitter, for the reason that the water of the brook becomes bitter by flowing through the kind of soil and the veins in which there are sandarach mines., LINE: 828, BOOK: The Ten Books on Architecture by Vitruvius, KEYWORD: also spring issu exceedingli bitter owe bitter juic soil river forti mile sourc tast sweet reach point one hundr sixti mile mouth small brook run make vast river bitter reason water brook becom bitter flow kind soil vein mine

It is the inclination of the firmament and the force of the sun, as it draws nearer or recedes in its course, that make these diversities such as we find them in different countries and places, through the nature of the soil and it's juices. And not only in the case of the things mentioned, but also in that of sheep and cattle.

For instance, there are in Boeotia the rivers Cephisus andMelas, in Lucania, the Crathis, in Troy, the Xanthus, and certain springs in the country of the Clazomenians, the Erythraeans, and the Laodiceans. When sheep are ready for breeding at the proper season of the year, they are driven every day during that season to those rivers to drink, and the result is that, however white they may be, they beget in some places whity-brown lambs, in other places gray, and in others black as a raven. Thus, the peculiar character of the liquid, entering their body, produces in each case the quality with which it is imbued.

By one of these, travellers are in the habit of lying down and taking luncheon, because its water is good; but nobody goes near the stream on the other side of the tomb, because its water is said to be death-dealing. In Arcadia there is a tract of land called Nonacris, which has extremely cold water trickling from a rock in the mountains. This water is called "Water of the Styx," and no vessel, whether of silver, bronze, or iron, can stand it without flying to pieces and breaking up. Nothing but a mule's hoof can keep it together and hold it, and tradition says that it was thus conveyed by Antipater through his son Iollas into the province where Alexander was staying, and that the king was killed by him with this water., LINE: 835, BOOK: The Ten Books on Architecture by Vitruvius, KEYWORD: place buri approach right left tomb unit one travel habit lie take luncheon water good nobodi go near stream side tomb water said death deal tract land ha extrem cold water trickl rock mountain water water vessel whether silver bronz iron stand without fli piec break noth mule hoof keep togeth hold tradit say wa thu son provinc wa king wa water

Why such things are broken up by acid waters we can see from the following experiments. If an egg is left for some time in vinegar, its shell will soften and dissolve.

Twenty miles from it is the walled town of Ismuc, the lands belonging to which are marked off by a marvellous kind of boundary. For although Africa was the mother and nurse of wild animals, particularly serpents, yet not one is ever born in the lands of that town, and if ever one is imported and put there, it dies at once; and not only this, but if soil is taken from this spot to another place, the same is true there.

This great variety in different things is a distribution due tonature, for even the human body, which consists in part of the earthy, contains many kinds of juices, such as blood, milk, sweat, urine, and tears. If all this variation of flavours is found in a small portion of the earthy, we should not be surprised to find in the great earth itself countless varieties of juices, through the veins of which the water runs, and becomes saturated with them before reaching the outlets of springs. In this way, different varieties of springs of peculiar kinds are produced, on account of diversity of situation, characteristics of country, and dissimilar properties of soils., LINE: 848, BOOK: The Ten Books on Architecture by Vitruvius, KEYWORD: great varieti differ thing distribut due even human bodi part earthi mani kind juic blood milk sweat urin tear variat flavour found small portion earthi find great earth countless varieti juic vein water run becom satur reach outlet spring way differ varieti spring peculiar kind produc account divers situat characterist countri dissimilar properti soil

TEXT: CHAPTER IVTESTS OF GOOD WATER1. Springs should be tested and proved in advance in thefollowing ways. If they run free and open, inspect and observe the physique of the people who dwell in the vicinity before beginning to conduct the water, and if their frames are strong, their complexions fresh, legs sound, and eyes clear, the springs deserve complete approval. If it is a spring just dug out, its water is excellent if it can be sprinkled into a Corinthian vase or into any other sort made of good bronze without leaving a spot on it. Again, if such water is boiled in a bronze cauldron, afterwards left for a time, and then poured off without sand or mud being found at the bottom of the cauldron, that water also will have proved its excellence., LINE: 852, BOOK: The Ten Books on Architecture by Vitruvius, KEYWORD: chapter good water spring test prove advanc way run free open inspect observ physiqu peopl dwell vicin begin conduct water frame strong complexion fresh leg sound eye clear spring deserv complet approv spring dug water excel sprinkl vase sort made good bronz without leav spot water boil bronz afterward left time without sand mud found bottom water also prove excel

TEXT: CHAPTER VLEVELLING AND LEVELLING INSTRUMENTS1. I shall now treat of the ways in which water should beconducted to dwellings and cities. First comes the method of taking the level. Levelling is done either with dioptrae, or with water levels, or with the chorobates, but it is done with greater accuracy by means of the chorobates, because dioptrae and levels are deceptive. The chorobates is a straightedge about twenty feet long. At the extremities it has legs, made exactly alike and jointed on perpendicularly to the extremities of the straightedge, and also crosspieces, fastened by tenons, connecting the straightedge and the legs. These crosspieces have vertical lines drawn upon them, and there are plumblines hanging from the straightedge over each of the lines. When the straightedge is in position, and the plumblines strike both the lines alike and at the same time, they show that the instrument stands level., LINE: 854, BOOK: The Ten Books on Architecture by Vitruvius, KEYWORD: chapter instrument shall treat way water dwell citi first come method take level done either water level done greater accuraci mean level decept straightedg twenti foot long extrem ha leg made exactli alik joint perpendicularli extrem straightedg also crosspiec tenon straightedg leg crosspiec vertic line drawn upon hang straightedg line straightedg posit strike line alik time show instrument stand level
TEXT: 2. But if the wind interposes, and constant motion preventsany definite indication by the lines, then have a groove on theupper side, five feet long, one digit wide, and a digit and a half deep, and pour water into it. If the water comes up uniformly to the rims of the groove, it will be known that the instrument is level. When the level is thus found by means of the chorobates, the amount of fall will also be known., LINE: 855, BOOK: The Ten Books on Architecture by Vitruvius, KEYWORD: wind constant motion definit indic line groov side five foot long one digit wide digit half deep pour water water come uniformli rim groov known instrument level level thu found mean amount fall also known
TEXT: 3. Perhaps some reader of the works of Archimedes will saythat there can be no true levelling by means of water, because he holds that water has not a level surface, but is of a spherical form, having its centre at the centre of the earth. Still, whether water is plane or spherical, it necessarily follows that when the straightedge is level, it will support the water evenly at its extremities on the right and left, but that if it slopes down at one end, the water at the higher end will not reach the rim of the groove in the straightedge. For though the water, wherever poured in, must have a swelling and curvature in the centre, yet the extremities on the right and left must be on a level with each other. A picture of the chorobates will be found drawn at the end of the book. If there is to be a considerable fall, the conducting of the water will be comparatively easy. But if the course is broken by depressions, we must have recourse to substructures., LINE: 856, BOOK: The Ten Books on Architecture by Vitruvius, KEYWORD: perhap reader work true mean water hold water ha level surfac spheric form earth still whether water plane spheric necessarili straightedg level support water evenli extrem right left slope one end water higher end reach rim groov straightedg though water wherev must swell curvatur yet extrem right left must level pictur found drawn end book consider fall water compar easi cours broken depress must recours substructur
TEXT: CHAPTER VIAQUEDUCTS, WELLS, AND CISTERNS1. There are three methods of conducting water, in channelsthrough masonry conduits, or in lead pipes, or in pipes of baked clay.

When it has reached the city, build a reservoir with a distribution tank in three compartments connected with the reservoir to receive the water, and let the reservoir have three pipes, one for each of the connecting tanks, so that when the water runs over from the tanks at the ends, it may run into the one between them., LINE: 858, BOOK: The Ten Books on Architecture by Vitruvius, KEYWORD: quarter inch everi hundr foot let masonri structur arch sun may strike water ha citi build reservoir distribut tank three compart connect reservoir receiv water let reservoir three pipe one tank water run tank end may run one

From this central tank, pipes will be laid to all the basinsand fountains; from the second tank, to baths, so that they may yield an annual income to the state; and from the third, to private houses, so that water for public use will not run short; for people will be unable to divert it if they have only their own supplies from headquarters. This is the reason why I have made these divisions, and also in order that individuals who take water into their houses may by their taxes help to maintain the conducting of the water by the contractors., LINE: 859, BOOK: The Ten Books on Architecture by Vitruvius, KEYWORD: central tank pipe laid fountain second tank bath may yield annual incom state third privat hous water public use run short peopl unabl divert suppli headquart reason made divis also order individu take water hous may tax help maintain water contractor

But if the water is to be conducted in lead pipes, first build areservoir at the source; then, let the pipes have an interior area corresponding to the amount of water, and lay these pipes from this reservoir to the reservoir which is inside the city walls.

TEXT: 5. The conducting of the water through lead pipes is to bemanaged as follows. If there is a regular fall from the source to the city, without any intervening hills that are high enough to interrupt it, but with depressions in it, then we must build substructures to bring it up to the level as in the case of channels and conduits. If the distance round such depressions is not great, the water may be carried round circuitously; but if the valleys are extensive, the course will be directed down their slope. On reaching the bottom, a low substructure is built so that the level there may continue as long as possible. This will form the "venter," termed Κοιλἱα by the Greeks. Then, on reaching the hill on the opposite side, the length of the venter makes the water slow in swelling up to rise to the top of the hill., LINE: 863, BOOK: The Ten Books on Architecture by Vitruvius, KEYWORD: water lead pipe regular fall sourc citi without hill high enough interrupt depress must build substructur bring level case channel conduit distanc round depress great water may carri round circuit valley extens cours direct slope reach bottom low substructur built level may continu long possibl form venter reach hill opposit side length venter make water slow swell rise top hill
TEXT: 6. But if there is no such venter made in the valleys, nor anysubstructure built on a level, but merely an elbow, the water will break out, and burst the joints of the pipes. And in the venter, water cushions must be constructed to relieve the pressure of the air. Thus, those who have to conduct water through lead pipes will do it most successfully on these principles, because its descents, circuits, venters, and risings can be managed in this way, when the level of the fall from the sources to the city is once obtained., LINE: 864, BOOK: The Ten Books on Architecture by Vitruvius, KEYWORD: venter made valley built level mere elbow water break burst joint pipe venter water cushion must reliev pressur air thu conduct water lead pipe success principl descent circuit venter rise way level fall sourc citi

It is also not ineffectual to build reservoirs at intervals of24,000 feet, so that if a break occurs anywhere, it will not completely ruin the whole work, and the place where it has occurred can easily be found; but such reservoirs should not be built at a descent, nor in the plane of a venter, nor at risings, nor anywhere in valleys, but only where there is an unbroken level., LINE: 865, BOOK: The Ten Books on Architecture by Vitruvius, KEYWORD: also ineffectu build reservoir interv foot break anywher complet ruin whole work place ha easili found reservoir built descent plane venter rise anywher valley unbroken level
TEXT: 8. But if we wish to spend less money, we must proceed asfollows. Clay pipes with a skin at least two digits thick should be made, but these pipes should be tongued at one end so that they can fit into and join one another. Their joints must be coated with quicklime mixed with oil, and at the angles of the level of the venter a piece of red tufa stone, with a hole bored through it, must be placed right at the elbow, so that the last length of pipe used in the descent is jointed into the stone, and also the first length of the level of the venter; similarly at the hill on the opposite side the last length of the level of the venter should stick into the hole in the red tufa, and the first of the rise should be similarly jointed into it., LINE: 866, BOOK: The Ten Books on Architecture by Vitruvius, KEYWORD: wish spend less money must proceed clay pipe skin least two digit thick made pipe tongu one end fit join one anoth joint must coat quicklim mix oil angl level venter piec red tufa stone hole must right elbow last length pipe use descent joint stone also first length level venter similarli hill opposit side last length level venter stick hole red tufa first rise similarli joint
TEXT: 9. The level of the pipes being thus adjusted, they will not besprung out of place by the force generated at the descent and at the rising. For a strong current of air is generated in an aqueduct which bursts its way even through stones unless the water is let in slowly and sparingly from the source at first, and checked at the elbows or turns by bands, or by the weight of sand ballast. All the other arrangements should be made as in the case of lead pipes. And ashes are to be put in beforehand when the water is let in from the source for the first time, so that if any of the joints have not been sufficiently coated, they may be coated with ashes., LINE: 867, BOOK: The Ten Books on Architecture by Vitruvius, KEYWORD: level pipe thu place forc descent rise strong current air aqueduct burst way even stone unless water let slowli sparingli sourc first check elbow turn band weight sand ballast arrang made case lead pipe ash put beforehand water let sourc first time joint suffici coat may coat ash

Hence, water ought by no means to be conducted in lead pipes, if we want to have it wholesome.

Suppose there is a place or a field in the form of a square and we are required to double it. This has to be effected by means of lines correctly drawn, for it will take a kind of calculation not to be made by means of mere multiplication. The following is the demonstration. A square place ten feet long and ten feet wide gives an area of one hundred feet. Now if it is required to double the square, and to make one of two hundred feet, we must ask how long will be the side of that square so as to get from this the two hundred feet corresponding to the doubling of the area. Nobody can find this by means of arithmetic.

Therefore, since this is inexplicable by arithmetic, let adiagonal line be drawn from angle to angle of that square of ten feet in length and width, dividing it into two triangles of equal size, each fifty feet in area. Taking this diagonal line as the length, describe another square. Thus we shall have in the larger square four triangles of the same size and the same number of feet as the two of fifty feet each which were formed by the diagonal line in the smaller square. In this way Plato demonstrated the doubling by means of lines, as the figure appended at the bottom of the page will show., LINE: 883, BOOK: The Ten Books on Architecture by Vitruvius, KEYWORD: give one hundr nineti six foot fifteen two hundr twenti five foot therefor sinc inexplic arithmet let line drawn angl angl squar ten foot length width divid two triangl equal size fifti foot area take diagon line length describ anoth squar thu shall squar four triangl size number foot two fifti foot form diagon line smaller squar way doubl mean line figur bottom page show

Thus, the result which carpenters reach very laboriously, but scarcely to exactness, with their squares, can be demonstrated to perfection from the reasoning and methods of his teaching. If we take three rules, one three feet, the second four feet, and the third five feet in length, and join these rules together with their tips touching each other so as to make a triangular figure, they will form a right angle. Now if a square be described on the length of each one of these rules, the square on the side of three feet in length will have an area of nine feet; of four feet, sixteen; of five, twenty-five., LINE: 884, BOOK: The Ten Books on Architecture by Vitruvius, KEYWORD: right angl without contriv artisan thu result carpent reach labori scarc exact squar perfect reason method teach take three rule one three foot second four foot third five foot length join rule togeth tip touch make triangular figur form right angl squar length one rule squar side three foot length area nine foot four foot sixteen five twenti five

In the case of Archimedes, although he made manywonderful discoveries of diverse kinds, yet of them all, the following, which I shall relate, seems to have been the result of a boundless ingenuity. Hiero, after gaining the royal power in Syracuse, resolved, as a consequence of his successful exploits, to place in a certain temple a golden crown which he had vowed to the immortal gods. He contracted for its making at a fixed price, and weighed out a precise amount of gold to the contractor.

After this experiment, he likewise dropped the mass ofgold into the full vessel and, on taking it out and measuring as before, found that not so much water was lost, but a smaller quantity: namely, as much less as a mass of gold lacks in bulk compared to a mass of silver of the same weight. Finally, filling the vessel again and dropping the crown itself into the same quantity of water, he found that more water ran over for the crown than for the mass of gold of the same weight.

They made many discoveries from mathematics which are welcome to men, and so, though they deserve our thanks for other discoveries, they are particularly worthy of admiration for their ideas in that field. For example, each in a different way solved the problem enjoined upon Delos by Apollo in an oracle, the doubling of the number of cubic feet in his altars; this done, he said, the inhabitants of the island would be delivered from an offence against religion., LINE: 893, BOOK: The Ten Books on Architecture by Vitruvius, KEYWORD: let turn thought research made mani discoveri mathemat welcom men though deserv thank discoveri particularli worthi admir idea field exampl differ way problem upon oracl doubl number cubic foot altar done said inhabit island would religion

TEXT: CHAPTER ITHE ZODIAC AND THE PLANETS1. It is due to the divine intelligence and is a very great wonderto all who reflect upon it, that the shadow of a gnomon at the equinox is of one length in Athens, of another in Alexandria, of another in Rome, and not the same at Piacenza, or at other places in the world. Hence drawings for dials are very different from one another, corresponding to differences of situation. This is because the length of the shadow at the equinox is used in constructing the figure of the analemma, in accordance with which the hours are marked to conform to the situation and the shadow of the gnomon. The analemma is a basis for calculation deduced from the course of the sun, and found by observation of the shadow as it increases until the winter solstice. By means of this, through architectural principles and the employment of the compasses, we find out the operation of the sun in the universe., LINE: 900, BOOK: The Ten Books on Architecture by Vitruvius, KEYWORD: chapter zodiac planet due divin intellig great reflect upon shadow gnomon equinox one length anoth anoth place world henc draw dial differ one anoth correspond differ situat length shadow equinox use figur analemma accord hour mark conform situat shadow gnomon analemma basi calcul cours sun found observ shadow increas winter solstic mean architectur principl employ compass find oper sun univers
TEXT: 2. The word "universe" means the general assemblage of allnature, and it also means the heaven that is made up of the constellations and the courses of the stars. The heaven revolves steadily round earth and sea on the pivots at the ends of its axis. The architect at these points was the power of Nature, and she put the pivots there, to be, as it were, centres, one of them above the earth and sea at the very top of the firmament and even beyond the stars composing the Great Bear, the other on the opposite side under the earth in the regions of the south.

It follows from this natural arrangement that the centralpoint in the north is high above the earth, while on the south, the region below, it is beneath the earth and consequently hidden by it. Furthermore, across the middle, and obliquely inclined to the south, there is a broad circular belt composed of the twelve signs, whose stars, arranged in twelve equivalent divisions, represent each a shape which nature has depicted. And so with the firmament and the other constellations, they move round the earth and sea in glittering array, completing their orbits according to the spherical shape of the heaven., LINE: 903, BOOK: The Ten Books on Architecture by Vitruvius, KEYWORD: natur arrang north high earth south region beneath earth consequ hidden furthermor across middl obliqu south broad circular belt compos twelv sign whose star twelv equival divis repres shape natur ha firmament constel move round earth sea glitter array orbit accord spheric shape heaven

They are all visible or invisible according to fixed times.While six of the signs are passing along with the heaven above the earth, the other six are moving under the earth and hidden by its shadow. But there are always six of them making their way above the earth; for, corresponding to that part of the last sign which in the course of its revolution has to sink, pass under the earth, and become concealed, an equivalent part of the sign opposite to it is obliged by the law of their common revolution to pass up and, having completed its circuit, to emerge out of the darkness into the light of the open space on the other side. This is because the rising and setting of both are subject to one and the same power and law., LINE: 904, BOOK: The Ten Books on Architecture by Vitruvius, KEYWORD: visibl invis accord fix time six sign pass along heaven earth six move earth hidden shadow alway six make way earth correspond part last sign cours revolut ha sink earth becom conceal equival part sign opposit oblig law common revolut circuit emerg dark light open space side rise set subject one power law

While these signs, twelve in number and occupying eachone twelfth part of the firmament, steadily revolve from east to west, the moon, Mercury, Venus, the sun, as well as Mars,Jupiter, and Saturn, differing from one another in the magnitude of their orbits as though their courses were at different points in a flight of steps, pass through those signs in just the opposite direction, from west to east in the firmament. The moon makes her circuit of the heaven in twenty-eight days plus about an hour, and with her return to the sign from which she set forth, completes a lunar month., LINE: 905, BOOK: The Ten Books on Architecture by Vitruvius, KEYWORD: sign twelv number twelfth part firmament steadili revolv east west moon sun well mar one anoth magnitud orbit though cours differ point flight step sign opposit direct west east firmament moon make circuit heaven twenti eight day plu hour return sign set forth lunar month
TEXT: 6. The sun takes a full month to move across the space of onesign, that is, one twelfth of the firmament. Consequently, in twelve months he traverses the spaces of the twelve signs, and, on returning to the sign from which he began, completes the period of a full year. Hence, the circuit made by the moon thirteen times in twelve months, is measured by the sun only once in the same number of months. But Mercury and Venus, their paths wreathing around the sun's rays as their centre, retrograde and delay their movements, and so, from the nature of that circuit, sometimes wait at stopping-places within the spaces of the signs., LINE: 906, BOOK: The Ten Books on Architecture by Vitruvius, KEYWORD: sun take full month move across space one twelfth firmament consequ twelv month travers space twelv sign sign period full year henc circuit made moon thirteen time twelv month measur sun number month path around sun ray retrograd delay movement natur circuit sometim wait stop place within space sign
TEXT: 7. This fact may best be recognized from Venus. When she isfollowing the sun, she makes her appearance in the sky after his setting, and is then called the Evening Star, shining most brilliantly. At other times she precedes him, rising before day- break, and is named the Morning Star. Thus Mercury and Venus sometimes delay in one sign for a good many days, and at others advance pretty rapidly into another sign. They do not spend the same number of days in every sign, but the longer they have previously delayed, the more rapidly they accomplish their journeys after passing into the next sign, and thus they complete their appointed course.

Jupiter, climbing with gentler pace against the revolution of the firmament, travels through each sign in about three hundred and sixty days, and finishes in eleven years and three hundred and thirteen days, returning to the sign in which he had been twelve years before. Saturn, traversing the space of one sign in twenty-nine months plus a few days, is restored after twenty-nine years and about one hundred and sixty days to that in which he had been thirty years before. He is, as it appears, slower, because the nearer he is to the outermost part of the firmament, the greater is the orbit through which he has to pass., LINE: 910, BOOK: The Ten Books on Architecture by Vitruvius, KEYWORD: mar travers space constel six hundr eighti three day point set begin cours pass sign rapidli make number day whenev come paus climb pace revolut firmament travel sign three hundr sixti day finish eleven year three hundr thirteen day sign twelv year travers space one sign twenti nine month plu day twenti nine year one hundr sixti day thirti year outermost part firmament greater orbit ha
TEXT: 11. The three that complete their circuits above the sun'scourse do not make progress while they are in the triangle which he has entered, but retrograde and pause until the sun has crossed from that triangle into another sign. Some hold that this takes place because, as they say, when the sun is a great distance off, the paths on which these stars wander are without light on account of that distance, and so the darkness retards and hinders them. But I do not think that this is so. The splendour of the sun is clearly to be seen, and manifest without any kind of obscurity, throughout the whole firmament, so that those very retrograde movements and pauses of the stars are visible even to us., LINE: 911, BOOK: The Ten Books on Architecture by Vitruvius, KEYWORD: three complet circuit sun make progress triangl ha retrograd paus sun ha cross triangl anoth sign hold take place say sun great distanc path star wander without light account distanc dark retard think sun clearli seen manifest without kind obscur throughout whole firmament retrograd movement paus star visibl even
TEXT: 12. If then, at this great distance, our human vision can discernthat sight, why, pray, are we to think that the divine splendour of the stars can be cast into darkness? Rather will the following way of accounting for it prove to be correct. Heat summons and attracts everything towards itself; for instance, we see the fruits of the earth growing up high under the influence of heat, and that spring water is vapourised and drawn up to the clouds at sunrise. On the same principle, the mighty influence of the sun, with his rays diverging in the form of a triangle, attracts the stars which follow him, and, as it were, curbs and restrains those that precede, not allowing them to make progress, but obliging them to retrograde towards himself until he passes out into the sign that belongs to a different triangle., LINE: 912, BOOK: The Ten Books on Architecture by Vitruvius, KEYWORD: great distanc human vision sight pray think divin star cast dark rather follow way account prove correct heat summon everyth toward instanc see fruit earth grow high influenc heat spring water drawn cloud sunris principl mighti influenc sun ray diverg form triangl star follow curb preced make progress oblig retrograd toward pass sign differ triangl
TEXT: 13. Perhaps the question will be raised, why the sun by hisgreat heat causes these detentions in the fifth sign from himself rather than in the second or third, which are nearer. I will therefore set forth what seems to be the reason. His rays diverge through the firmament in straight lines as though forming an equilateral triangle, that is, to the fifth sign from the sun, no, LINE: 913, BOOK: The Ten Books on Architecture by Vitruvius, KEYWORD: perhap question rais sun heat caus detent fifth sign rather second third therefor set forth reason ray diverg firmament straight line though form equilater triangl fifth sign sun
TEXT: more, no less. If his rays were diffused in circuits spreading all over the firmament, instead of in straight lines diverging so as to form a triangle, they would burn up all the nearer objects. This is a fact which the Greek poet Euripides seems to have remarked; for he says that places at a greater distance from the sun are in a violent heat, and that those which are nearer he keeps temperate. Thus in the play of Phaethon, the poet writes: καἱει τἁ πὁρρω, τἁγγυθεν δ εὑκρατ ἑχει., LINE: 914, BOOK: The Ten Books on Architecture by Vitruvius, KEYWORD: less ray diffus circuit spread firmament instead straight line diverg form triangl would burn object fact poet say place greater distanc sun violent heat keep temper thu play poet

In spite of having to move in a direction contrary to that of the wheel, the ants must necessarily complete their journeys in the opposite direction, and that ant which is nearest the centre must finish its circuit sooner, while the ant that is going round at the outer edge of the disc of the wheel must, on account of the size of its circuit, be much slower in completing its course, even though it is moving, LINE: 917, BOOK: The Ten Books on Architecture by Vitruvius, KEYWORD: exampl place seven ant wheel made seven channel wheel increas success circumfer suppos ant oblig make circuit channel wheel turn opposit direct spite move direct contrari wheel ant must necessarili complet journey opposit direct ant nearest must finish circuit sooner ant go round outer edg disc wheel must account size circuit much cours even though move

TEXT: 16. The reason why some of these stars are temperate, othershot, and others cold, appears to be this: that the flame of every kind of fire rises to higher places. Consequently, the burning rays of the sun make the ether above him white hot, in the regions of the course of Mars, and so the heat of the sun makes him hot. Saturn, on the contrary, being nearest to the outermost limit of the firmament and bordering on the quarters of the heaven which are frozen, is excessively cold. Hence, Jupiter, whose course is between the orbits of these two, appears to have a moderate and very temperate influence, intermediate between their cold and heat., LINE: 919, BOOK: The Ten Books on Architecture by Vitruvius, KEYWORD: reason star temper cold flame everi kind fire rise higher place consequ burn ray sun make ether white hot region cours mar heat sun make hot contrari nearest outermost limit firmament border quarter heaven frozen excess cold henc whose cours orbit two moder temper influenc intermedi cold heat

TEXT: CHAPTER IITHE PHASES OF THE MOON1. According to the teaching of Berosus, who came from thestate, or rather nation, of the Chaldees, and was the pioneer of Chaldean learning in Asia, the moon is a ball, one half luminous and the rest of a blue colour. When, in the course of her orbit, she has passed below the disc of the sun, she is attracted by his rays and great heat, and turns thither her luminous side, on account of the sympathy between light and light. Being thus summoned by the sun's disc and facing upward, her lower half, as it is not luminous, is invisible on account of its likeness to the air. When she is perpendicular to the sun's rays, all her light is confined to her upper surface, and she is then called the new moon., LINE: 921, BOOK: The Ten Books on Architecture by Vitruvius, KEYWORD: chapter phase moon accord teach came rather nation wa pioneer learn moon ball one half lumin rest blue colour cours orbit ha disc sun ray great heat turn thither lumin side account sympathi light light thu sun disc face upward lower half lumin invis account like air perpendicular sun ray light confin upper surfac new moon
TEXT: 2. As she moves on, passing by to the east, the effect of thesun upon her relaxes, and the outer edge of the luminous side sheds its light upon the earth in an exceedingly thin line. This is called the second day of the moon. Day by day she is further relieved and turns, and thus are numbered the third, fourth, and following days. On the seventh day, the sun being in the west and the moon in the middle of the firmament between the east and west, she is half the extent of the firmament distant from the sun, and therefore half of the luminous side is turned toward the earth. But when the sun and moon are separated by the entire extent of the firmament, and the moon is in the east with the sun, LINE: 922, BOOK: The Ten Books on Architecture by Vitruvius, KEYWORD: move pass east effect upon outer edg lumin side shed light upon earth exceedingli thin line second day moon day day reliev turn thu third fourth follow day seventh day sun west moon middl firmament east west half extent firmament distant sun therefor half lumin side turn toward earth sun moon entir extent firmament moon east sun
TEXT: over against her in the west, she is completely relieved by her still greater distance from his rays, and so, on the fourteenth day, she is at the full, and her entire disc emits its light. On the succeeding days, up to the end of the month, she wanes daily as she turns in her course, being recalled by the sun until she comes under his disc and rays, thus completing the count of the days of the month., LINE: 923, BOOK: The Ten Books on Architecture by Vitruvius, KEYWORD: west complet reliev still greater distanc ray fourteenth day full entir disc light succeed day end month wane daili turn cours sun come disc ray thu count day month

Next, crossing from Leo into Virgo, and advancing as far as the bosom of her garment, he still further shortens his circuit, making his course equal to what it was in Taurus. Advancing from Virgo by way of the bosom of her garment, which forms the first part of Libra, he determines the autumn equinox at the end of one eighth of Libra.

TEXT: 3. When the sun has entered Scorpio, at the time of the settingof the Pleiades, he begins to make the days shorter as he advances toward the south. From Scorpio he enters Sagittarius and, on reaching the thighs, his daily course is still further diminished. From the thighs of Sagittarius, which are reckoned as part of Capricornus, he reaches the end of the first eighth of the latter, where his course in heaven is shortest. Consequently, this season, from the shortness of the day, is called bruma or dies brumales. Crossing from Capricornus into Aquarius, he causes the days to increase to the length which they had when he was in Sagittarius. From Aquarius he enters Pisces at the time when Favonius begins to blow, and here his course is the same as in Scorpio.

These constellations, whose outlines and shapes in theheavens were designed by Nature and the divine intelligence, I have described according to the view of the natural philosopher Democritus, but only those whose risings and settings we can observe and see with our own eyes. Just as the Bears turn round the pivot of the axis without ever setting or sinking under the earth, there are likewise stars that keep turning round the southern pivot, which on account of the inclination of the firmament lies always under the earth, and, being hidden there, they never rise and emerge above the earth. Consequently, the figures which they form are unknown to us on account of the interposition of the earth. The star Canopus proves this.

These discoveries have been transmitted by the men of genius and great acuteness who sprang directly from the nation of the Chaldeans; first of all, by Berosus, who settled in the island state of Cos, and there opened a school.

TEXT: CHAPTER VIITHE ANALEMMA AND ITS APPLICATIONS1. In distinction from the subjects first mentioned, we mustourselves explain the principles which govern the shortening and lengthening of the day. When the sun is at the equinoxes, that is, passing through Aries or Libra, he makes the gnomon cast a shadow equal to eight ninths of its own length, in the latitude of Rome. In Athens, the shadow is equal to three fourths of the length of the gnomon; at Rhodes to five sevenths; at Tarentum, to nine elevenths; at Alexandria, to three fifths; and so at other places it is found that the shadows of equinoctial gnomons are naturally different from one another., LINE: 953, BOOK: The Ten Books on Architecture by Vitruvius, KEYWORD: chapter analemma applic distinct subject first explain principl govern shorten day sun equinox pass libra make gnomon cast shadow equal eight ninth length latitud shadow equal three fourth length gnomon five seventh nine eleventh three fifth place found shadow equinocti gnomon natur differ one anoth
TEXT: 2. Hence, wherever a sundial is to be constructed, we musttake the equinoctial shadow of the place. If it is found to be, asin Rome, equal to eight ninths of the gnomon, let a line be drawn on a plane surface, and in the middle thereof erect a perpendicular, plumb to the line, which perpendicular is called the gnomon. Then, from the line in the plane, let the line of the gnomon be divided off by the compasses into nine parts, and take the point designating the ninth part as a centre, to be marked by the letter A. Then, opening the compasses from that centre to the line in the plane at the point B, describe a circle. This circle is called the meridian., LINE: 954, BOOK: The Ten Books on Architecture by Vitruvius, KEYWORD: henc wherev sundial equinocti shadow place found equal eight ninth gnomon let line drawn plane surfac middl thereof erect perpendicular plumb line perpendicular gnomon line plane let line gnomon divid compass nine part take point ninth part mark letter open compass line plane point describ circl circl meridian
TEXT: 3. Then, of the nine parts between the plane and the centre onthe gnomon, take eight, and mark them off on the line in the plane to the point C. This will be the equinoctial shadow of the gnomon. From that point, marked by C, let a line be drawn through the centre at the point A, and this will represent a ray of the sun at the equinox. Then, extending the compasses from the centre to the line in the plane, mark off the equidistant points E on the left and I on the right, on the two sides of the circumference, and let a line be drawn through the centre, dividing the circle into two equal semicircles. This line is called by mathematicians the horizon., LINE: 955, BOOK: The Ten Books on Architecture by Vitruvius, KEYWORD: nine part plane gnomon take eight mark line plane point equinocti shadow gnomon point mark let line drawn point repres ray sun equinox extend compass line plane mark equidist point left right two side circumfer let line drawn divid circl two equal semicircl line mathematician horizon

Then, take a fifteenth part of the entire circumference, and,placing the centre of the compasses on the circumference at the point where the equinoctial ray cuts it at the letter F, mark off the points G and H on the right and left. Then lines must be drawn from these (and the centre) to the line of the plane at the points T and R, and thus, one will represent the ray of the sun in winter, and the other the ray in summer. Opposite E will be the point I, where the line drawn through the centre at the point A cuts the circumference; opposite G and H will be the points L and K; and opposite C, F, and A will be the point N., LINE: 956, BOOK: The Ten Books on Architecture by Vitruvius, KEYWORD: take fifteenth part entir circumfer compass circumfer point equinocti ray cut letter mark point right left line must drawn line plane point thu one repres ray sun winter ray summer opposit point line drawn point cut circumfer opposit point opposit point

These diameters are to be divided equally in the middle at the points M and O, and those centres marked; then, through these marks and the centre A, draw a line extending to the two sides of the circumference at the points P and Q. This will be a line perpendicular to the equinoctial ray, and it is called in mathematical figures the axis. From these same centres open the compasses to the ends of the diameters, and describe semicircles, one of which will be for summer and the other for winter., LINE: 957, BOOK: The Ten Books on Architecture by Vitruvius, KEYWORD: diamet drawn upper denot summer lower winter portion diamet divid equal middl point mark mark draw line extend two side circumfer point line perpendicular equinocti ray mathemat figur axi open compass end diamet describ semicircl one summer winter

This having been drawn and completed, the scheme ofhours is next to be drawn on the baseplates from the analemma, according to the winter lines, or those of summer, or the equinoxes, or the months, and thus many different kinds of dials may be laid down and drawn by this ingenious method. But the result of all these shapes and designs is in one respect the same: namely, the days of the equinoxes and of the winter and summer solstices are always divided into twelve equal parts. Omitting details, therefore,—not for fear of the trouble, but lest I should prove tiresome by writing too much,—I will state by whom the different classes and designs of dials have been invented.

TEXT: 2. Methods of making water clocks have been investigated bythe same writers, and first of all by Ctesibius the Alexandrian, who also discovered the natural pressure of the air and pneumatic principles. It is worth while for students to know how these discoveries came about. Ctesibius, born at Alexandria, was the son of a barber. Preëminent for natural ability and great industry, he is said to have amused himself with ingenious devices. For example, wishing to hang a mirror in his father's shop in such a way that, on being lowered and raised again, its weight should be raised by means of a concealed cord, he employed the following mechanical contrivance., LINE: 964, BOOK: The Ten Books on Architecture by Vitruvius, KEYWORD: method make water clock writer first also discov natur pressur air pneumat principl worth student know discoveri came born wa son barber natur abil great industri said amus ingeni devic exampl wish mirror father shop way rais weight rais mean conceal cord employ follow mechan contriv
TEXT: 3. Under the roof-beam he fixed a wooden channel in whichhe arranged a block of pulleys. He carried the cord along the channel to the corner, where he set up some small piping. Into this a leaden ball, attached to the cord, was made to descend. As, LINE: 965, BOOK: The Ten Books on Architecture by Vitruvius, KEYWORD: roof beam fix wooden channel block pulley carri cord along channel corner set small pipe leaden ball attach cord wa made descend
TEXT: the weight fell into the narrow limits of the pipe, it naturally compressed the enclosed air, and, as its fall was rapid, it forced the mass of compressed air through the outlet into the open air, thus producing a distinct sound by the concussion., LINE: 966, BOOK: The Ten Books on Architecture by Vitruvius, KEYWORD: weight fell narrow limit pipe natur compress air fall wa rapid forc mass compress air outlet open air thu distinct sound concuss
TEXT: 4. Hence, Ctesibius, observing that sounds and tones wereproduced by the contact between the free air and that which was forced from the pipe, made use of this principle in the construction of the first water organs. He also devised methods of raising water, automatic contrivances, and amusing things of many kinds, including among them the construction of water clocks. He began by making an orifice in a piece of gold, or by perforating a gem, because these substances are not worn by the action of water, and do not collect dirt so as to get stopped up., LINE: 967, BOOK: The Ten Books on Architecture by Vitruvius, KEYWORD: henc observ sound tone contact free air wa forc pipe made use principl construct first water organ also method rais water automat contriv amus thing mani kind among construct water clock make orific piec gold gem substanc worn action water collect dirt get stop
TEXT: 5. A regular flow of water through the orifice raises aninverted bowl, called by mechanicians the "cork" or "drum." To this are attached a rack and a revolving drum, both fitted with teeth at regular intervals. These teeth, acting upon one another, induce a measured revolution and movement. Other racks and other drums, similarly toothed and subject to the same motion, give rise by their revolution to various kinds of motions, by which figures are moved, cones revolve, pebbles or eggs fall, trumpets sound, and other incidental effects take place., LINE: 968, BOOK: The Ten Books on Architecture by Vitruvius, KEYWORD: regular flow water orific rais bowl cork drum attach rack revolv drum fit teeth regular interv teeth act upon one anoth induc measur revolut movement rack drum similarli tooth subject motion give rise revolut variou kind motion figur cone revolv pebbl egg fall trumpet sound incident effect take place
TEXT: 6. The hours are marked in these clocks on a column or apilaster, and a figure emerging from the bottom points to them with a rod throughout the whole day. Their decrease or increase in length with the different days and months, must be adjusted by inserting or withdrawing wedges. The shutoffs for regulating the water are constructed as follows. Two cones are made, one solid and the other hollow, turned on a lathe so that one will go into the other and fit it perfectly.

TEXT: is not in agreement with the insertion and removal of the wedges, because the wedges may very often cause errors, the following arrangement will have to be made. Let the hours be marked off transversely on the column from the analemma, and let the lines of the months also be marked upon the column. Then let the column be made to revolve, in such a way that, as it turns continuously towards the figure and the rod with which the emerging figure points to the hours, it may make the hours short or long according to the respective months., LINE: 971, BOOK: The Ten Books on Architecture by Vitruvius, KEYWORD: agreement insert remov wedg wedg may often caus error follow arrang made let hour mark transvers column analemma let line month also mark upon column let column made revolv way turn continu toward figur rod figur point hour may make hour short long accord respect month
TEXT: 8. There is also another kind of winter dial, called theAnaphoric and constructed in the following way. The hours, indicated by bronze rods in accordance with the figure of the analemma, radiate from a centre on the face. Circles are described upon it, marking the limits of the months. Behind these rods there is a drum, on which is drawn and painted the firmament with the circle of the signs. In drawing the figures of the twelve celestial signs, one is represented larger and the next smaller, proceeding from the centre. Into the back of the drum, in the middle, a revolving axis is inserted, and round that axis is wound a flexible bronze chain, at one end of which hangs the "cork" which is raised by the water, and at the other a counterpoise of sand, equal in weight to the "cork.", LINE: 972, BOOK: The Ten Books on Architecture by Vitruvius, KEYWORD: also anoth kind winter dial follow way hour bronz rod accord figur analemma radiat face circl upon mark limit month behind rod drum drawn paint firmament circl sign draw figur twelv celesti sign one next smaller proceed back drum middl revolv axi insert round axi wound flexibl bronz chain one end cork rais water counterpois sand equal weight cork
TEXT: 9. Hence, the sand sinks as the "cork" is raised by the water,and in sinking turns the axis, and the axis the drum. The revolution of this drum causes sometimes a larger and sometimes a smaller portion of the circle of the signs to indicate,, LINE: 973, BOOK: The Ten Books on Architecture by Vitruvius, KEYWORD: henc sand sink cork rais water sink turn axi axi drum revolut drum caus sometim sometim smaller portion circl sign indic
TEXT: during the revolutions, the proper length of the hours corresponding to their seasons. For in every one of the signs there are as many holes as the corresponding month has days, and a boss, which seems to be holding the representation of the sun on a dial, designates the spaces for the hours. This, as it is carried from hole to hole, completes the circuit of a full month., LINE: 974, BOOK: The Ten Books on Architecture by Vitruvius, KEYWORD: revolut proper length hour correspond season everi one sign mani hole correspond month ha day hold represent sun dial space hour carri hole hole circuit full month
TEXT: 10. Hence, just as the sun during his passage through theconstellations makes the days and hours longer or shorter, so the boss on a dial, moving from point to point in a direction contrary to that of the revolution of the drum in the middle, is carried day by day sometimes over wider and sometimes over narrower spaces, giving a representation of the hours and days within the limits of each month., LINE: 975, BOOK: The Ten Books on Architecture by Vitruvius, KEYWORD: henc sun passag make day hour longer shorter dial move point point direct contrari revolut drum middl carri day day sometim sometim narrow space give represent hour day within limit month
TEXT: To manage the water so that it may flow regularly, we mustproceed as follows.11. Inside, behind the face of the dial, place a reservoir, and letthe water run down into it through a pipe, and let it have a hole at the bottom. Fastened to it is a bronze drum with an opening through which the water flows into it from the reservoir. Enclosed in this drum there is a smaller one, the two being perfectly jointed together by tenon and socket, in such a way that the smaller drum revolves closely but easily in the larger, like a stopcock., LINE: 976, BOOK: The Ten Books on Architecture by Vitruvius, KEYWORD: manag water may flow regularli insid behind face dial place reservoir water run pipe let hole bottom bronz drum open water flow reservoir drum smaller one two perfectli joint togeth tenon socket way smaller drum close easili like stopcock
TEXT: 12. On the lip of the larger drum there are three hundred andsixty-five points, marked off at equal intervals. The rim of the smaller one has a tongue fixed on its circumference, with the tip directed towards those points; and also in this rim is a small opening, through which water runs into the drum and keeps the works going. The figures of the celestial signs being on the lip, LINE: 977, BOOK: The Ten Books on Architecture by Vitruvius, KEYWORD: lip drum three hundr five point mark equal interv rim smaller one ha tongu fix circumfer tip direct toward point also rim small open water run drum keep work go figur celesti sign lip

TEXT: 13. Hence, when the sun is in Capricornus, the tongue on therim touches every day one of the points in Capricornus on the lip of the larger drum, and is perpendicular to the strong pressure of the running water. So the water is quickly driven through the opening in the rim to the inside of the vessel, which, receiving it and soon becoming full, shortens and diminishes the length of the days and hours. But when, owing to the daily revolution of the smaller drum, its tongue reaches the points in Aquarius, the opening will no longer be perpendicular, and the water must give up its vigorous flow and run in a slower stream. Thus, the less the velocity with which the vessel receives the water, the more the length of the days is increased., LINE: 979, BOOK: The Ten Books on Architecture by Vitruvius, KEYWORD: henc sun tongu touch everi day one point lip drum perpendicular strong pressur run water water quickli driven open rim insid vessel soon becom full length day hour owe daili revolut smaller drum tongu reach point open longer perpendicular water must give vigor flow run stream thu less veloc vessel water length day
TEXT: 14. Then the opening in the rim passes from point to point inAquarius and Pisces, as though going upstairs, and when it reaches the end of the first eighth of Aries, the fall of the water is of medium strength, indicating the equinoctial hours. From Aries the opening passes, with the revolution of the drum, through Taurus and Gemini to the highest point at the end of the first eighth of Cancer, and when it reaches that point, the power diminishes, and hence, with the slower flow, its delay lengthens the days in the sign Cancer, producing the hours of the summer solstice.

TEXT: EbdE-BooksDirectory.comBOOK XINTRODUCTION1. In the famous and important Greek city of Ephesus there issaid to be an ancient ancestral law, the terms of which are severe, but its justice is not inequitable. When an architect accepts the charge of a public work, he has to promise what the cost of it will be. His estimate is handed to the magistrate, and his property is pledged as security until the work is done. When it is finished, if the outlay agrees with his statement, he is complimented by decrees and marks of honour. If no more than a fourth has to be added to his estimate, it is furnished by the treasury and no penalty is inflicted. But when more than one fourth has to be spent in addition on the work, the money required to finish it is taken from his property., LINE: 983, BOOK: The Ten Books on Architecture by Vitruvius, KEYWORD: famou import citi ancient ancestr law term sever justic inequit architect charg public work ha promis cost estim hand magistr properti secur work done finish outlay statement decre mark fourth ha ad estim furnish treasuri penalti one fourth ha spent addit work money finish taken properti

TEXT: which forms the final conclusion of my treatise, the principles which govern machines.CHAPTER IMACHINES AND IMPLEMENTS1. A machine is a combination of timbers fastened together,chiefly efficacious in moving great weights. Such a machine is set in motion on scientific principles in circular rounds, which the Greeks call κυλικη κἱνησις. There is, however, a class intended for climbing, termed in Greek ἁκροβατικὁν, another worked by air, which with them is called πνευματικὁν, and a third for hoisting; this the Greeks named βαρουλκὁς. In the climbing class are machines so disposed that one can safely climb up high, by means of timbers set up on end and connected by crossbeams, in order to view operations. In the pneumatic class, air is forced by pressure to produce sounds and tones as in an ὁργανον., LINE: 988, BOOK: The Ten Books on Architecture by Vitruvius, KEYWORD: form final conclus treatis principl govern machin chapter implement machin combin timber togeth chiefli efficaci move great weight machin set motion scientif principl circular round call howev class intend climb anoth work air third hoist climb class machin dispos one safe climb high mean timber set end connect crossbeam order view oper pneumat class air forc pressur produc sound tone
TEXT: 2. In the hoisting class, heavy weights are removed bymachines which raise them up and set them in position. The climbing machine displays no scientific principle, but merely a spirit of daring. It is held together by dowels and crossbeams and twisted lashings and supporting props. A machine that gets its motive power by pneumatic pressure will produce pretty effects by scientific refinements. But the hoisting machine has opportunities for usefulness which are greater and full of grandeur, and it is of the highest efficacy when used with intelligence., LINE: 989, BOOK: The Ten Books on Architecture by Vitruvius, KEYWORD: hoist class heavi weight remov rais set posit climb machin display scientif principl mere spirit dare togeth dowel crossbeam twist support prop machin get motiv power pneumat pressur produc pretti effect scientif refin hoist machin ha opportun use greater full grandeur highest efficaci use intellig
TEXT: 3. Some of these act on the principle of the μηχανἡ, others onthat of the ὁργανον. The difference between "machines" and "engines" is obviously this, that machines need more workmen and greater power to make them take effect, as for instance ballistae and the beams of presses. Engines, on the other hand, accomplish their purpose at the intelligent touch of a single workman, as the scorpio or anisocycli when they are turned. Therefore engines, as well as machines, are, in principle, practical necessities, without which nothing can be unattended with difficulties., LINE: 990, BOOK: The Ten Books on Architecture by Vitruvius, KEYWORD: act principl differ machin engin obvious machin need workman greater power make take effect instanc ballista beam press engin hand accomplish purpos intellig touch singl workman turn therefor engin well machin principl practic necess without noth unattend difficulti
TEXT: 4. All machinery is derived from nature, and is founded on theteaching and instruction of the revolution of the firmament. Let us but consider the connected revolutions of the sun, the moon, and the five planets, without the revolution of which, due to mechanism, we should not have had the alternation of day and night, nor the ripening of fruits. Thus, when our ancestors had seen that this was so, they took their models from nature, and by imitating them were led on by divine facts, until they perfected the contrivances which are so serviceable in our life. Some things, with a view to greater convenience, they worked out by means of machines and their revolutions, others by means of engines, and so, whatever they found to be useful for investigations, for the arts, and for established practices, they took care to improve step by step on scientific principles., LINE: 991, BOOK: The Ten Books on Architecture by Vitruvius, KEYWORD: machineri deriv natur instruct revolut firmament let consid connect revolut sun moon five planet without revolut due mechan altern day night ripen fruit thu ancestor seen wa took model natur led divin fact perfect contriv servic life thing view greater conveni work mean machin revolut mean engin whatev found use investig art establish practic took care improv step step scientif principl

There are also innumerable ways of employing machinery about which it seems unnecessary to speak, since they are at hand every day; such as mills, blacksmiths' bellows, carriages, gigs, turning lathes, and other things which are habitually used as general conveniences. Hence, we shall begin by explaining those that rarely come to hand, so that they may be understood., LINE: 994, BOOK: The Ten Books on Architecture by Vitruvius, KEYWORD: discoveri method test weight balanc save fraud honest practic life also innumer way machineri unnecessari speak sinc hand everi day mill blacksmith bellow carriag gig turn lath thing habitu use gener conveni henc shall begin explain rare come hand may understood
TEXT: CHAPTER IIHOISTING MACHINES1. First we shall treat of those machines which are of necessitymade ready when temples and public buildings are to be constructed. Two timbers are provided, strong enough for the weight of the load. They are fastened together at the upper end by a bolt, then spread apart at the bottom, and so set up, being kept upright by ropes attached at the upper ends and fixed at intervals all round. At the top is fastened a block, which some call a "rechamus." In the block two sheaves are enclosed, turning on axles. The traction rope is carried over the sheave at, LINE: 995, BOOK: The Ten Books on Architecture by Vitruvius, KEYWORD: chapter machin first shall treat machin readi templ public build two timber provid strong enough weight load togeth upper end bolt spread apart bottom set kept upright rope attach upper end fix interv round top block call block two sheaf turn axl traction rope carri sheav

Then it is brought back to a sheave at the bottom of the upper block, and so it goes down to the lower block, where it is fastened through a hole in that block. The other end of the rope is brought back and down between the legs of the machine., LINE: 996, BOOK: The Ten Books on Architecture by Vitruvius, KEYWORD: top let fall round sheav block brought back sheav bottom upper block go lower block hole block end rope brought back leg machin
TEXT: 2. Socket-pieces are nailed to the hinder faces of the squaredtimbers at the point where they are spread apart, and the ends of the windlass are inserted into them so that the axles may turn freely. Close to each end of the windlass are two holes, so adjusted that handspikes can be fitted into them. To the bottom of the lower block are fastened shears made of iron, whose prongs are brought to bear upon the stones, which have holes bored in them. When one end of the rope is fastened to the windlass, and the latter is turned round by working the handspikes, the rope winds round the windlass, gets taut, and thus it raises the load to the proper height and to its place in the work., LINE: 997, BOOK: The Ten Books on Architecture by Vitruvius, KEYWORD: socket piec hinder face point spread apart end windlass insert axl may turn freeli close end windlass two hole handspik fit bottom lower block shear made iron whose prong brought bear upon stone hole one end rope windlass latter turn round work handspik rope wind round windlass get taut thu rais load proper height place work
TEXT: 3. This kind of machinery, revolving with three sheaves, iscalled a trispast. When there are two sheaves turning in the block beneath and three in the upper, the machine is termed a pentaspast. But if we have to furnish machines for heavier loads, we must use timbers of greater length and thickness, providing them with correspondingly large bolts at the top, and windlasses turning at the bottom. When these are ready, let forestays be attached and left lying slack in front; let the backstays be carried over the shoulders of the machine to some distance, and, if there is nothing to which they can be fastened, sloping piles should be driven, the ground rammed down all round to fix them firmly, and the ropes made fast to them., LINE: 998, BOOK: The Ten Books on Architecture by Vitruvius, KEYWORD: kind machineri revolv three sheaf trispast two sheaf turn block beneath three upper machin furnish machin load must use timber greater length thick provid correspondingli larg bolt top windlass turn bottom readi let forestay attach left lie slack front let backstay carri shoulder machin distanc noth slope pile driven ground round fix firmli rope made fast
TEXT: 4. A block should then be attached by a stout cord to the top ofthe machine, and from that point a rope should be carried to a pile, and to a block tied to the pile. Let the rope be put in round the sheave of this block, and brought back to the block that is fastened at the top of the machine. Round its sheave the rope should be passed, and then should go down from the top, and back to the windlass, which is at the bottom of the machine, and there be fastened. The windlass is now to be turned by means of the handspikes, and it will raise the machine of itself without danger. Thus, a machine of the larger kind will be set in position, with its ropes in their places about it, and its stays attached to the piles. Its blocks and traction ropes are arranged as described above., LINE: 999, BOOK: The Ten Books on Architecture by Vitruvius, KEYWORD: block attach stout cord top machin point rope carri pile block tie pile let rope put round sheav block brought back block top machin round sheav rope top back windlass bottom machin windlass turn mean handspik rais machin without danger thu machin kind set posit rope place stay attach pile block traction rope

But if the loads of material for the work are still morecolossal in size and weight, we shall not entrust them to a windlass, but set in an axle-tree, held by sockets as the windlass was, and carrying on its centre a large drum, which some term a wheel, but the Greeks call it ἁμφἱεσις or περιθἡκιον., LINE: 1000, BOOK: The Ten Books on Architecture by Vitruvius, KEYWORD: load materi work still size weight shall entrust windlass set axl tree socket windlass wa carri larg drum term wheel call
TEXT: 6. And the blocks in such machines are not arranged in thesame, but in a different manner; for the rows of sheaves in them are doubled, both at the bottom and at the top. The traction rope is passed through a hole in the lower block, in such a way that the two ends of the rope are of equal length when it is stretched out, and both portions are held there at the lower block by a cord which is passed round them and lashed so that they cannot come out either to the right or the left. Then the ends of the rope are brought up into the block at the top from the outside, and passed down over its lower sheaves, and so return to the bottom, and are passed from the inside to the sheaves in the lowest block,, LINE: 1001, BOOK: The Ten Books on Architecture by Vitruvius, KEYWORD: block machin differ manner row sheaf doubl bottom top traction rope hole lower block way two end rope equal length portion lower block cord round cannot come either right left end rope brought block top outsid lower sheaf return bottom insid sheaf block

Passing over these from the outside, they are then carried tothe right and left of the drum on the axle-tree, and are tied there so as to stay fast. Then another rope is wound round the drum and carried to a capstan, and when that is turned, it turns the drum and the axle-tree, the ropes get taut as they wind round regularly, and thus they raise the loads smoothly and with no danger. But if a larger drum is placed either in the middle or at one side, without any capstan, men can tread in it and accomplish the work more expeditiously., LINE: 1002, BOOK: The Ten Books on Architecture by Vitruvius, KEYWORD: brought right left return top round highest set sheaf pass outsid carri right left drum axl tree tie stay fast anoth rope wound round drum carri capstan turn turn drum axl tree rope get taut wind round regularli thu rais load smoothli danger drum either middl one side without capstan men tread accomplish work expediti
TEXT: 8. There is also another kind of machine, ingenious enoughand easy to use with speed, but only experts can work with it. It consists of a single timber, which is set up and held in place by stays on four sides. Two cheeks are nailed on below the stays, a block is fastened by ropes above the cheeks, and a straight piece of wood about two feet long, six digits wide, and four digits thick, is put under the block. The blocks used have each three rows of sheaves side by side. Hence three traction ropes are fastened at the top of the machine. Then they are brought to the block at the bottom, and passed from the inside round the sheaves that are nearest the top of it. Then they are brought back to the upper block, and passed inwards from outside round the sheaves nearest the bottom., LINE: 1003, BOOK: The Ten Books on Architecture by Vitruvius, KEYWORD: also anoth kind machin ingeni easi use speed expert work singl timber set place stay four side two cheek stay block rope cheek straight piec wood two foot long six digit wide four digit thick put block block use three row sheaf side side henc three traction rope top machin brought block bottom insid round sheaf nearest top brought back upper block inward outsid round sheaf nearest bottom

On coming down to the block at the bottom, they are carriedround its second row of sheaves from the inside to the outside, and brought back to the second row at the top, passing round it and returning to the bottom; then from the bottom they are carried to the summit, where they pass round the highest row of sheaves, and then return to the bottom of the machine.

TEXT: 10. This kind of machine is called a polyspast, because of themany revolving sheaves to which its dexterity and despatch are due.

TEXT: 11. It may also not be out of place to explain the ingeniousprocedure of Chersiphron. Desiring to convey the shafts for the temple of Diana at Ephesus from the stone quarries, and not trusting to carts, lest their wheels should be engulfed on account of the great weights of the load and the softness of the roads in the plain, he tried the following plan. Using four-inch timbers, he joined two of them, each as long as the shaft, with two crosspieces set between them, dovetailing all together, and then leaded iron gudgeons shaped like dovetails into the ends of the shafts, as dowels are leaded, and in the woodwork he fixed rings to contain the pivots, and fastened wooden cheeks to the ends., LINE: 1008, BOOK: The Ten Books on Architecture by Vitruvius, KEYWORD: may also place explain convey shaft templ stone quarri trust cart lest wheel account great weight load soft road plain tri follow plan four inch timber two long shaft two crosspiec set togeth lead iron gudgeon shape like dovetail end shaft dowel lead woodwork fix ring contain pivot wooden cheek end
TEXT: The pivots, being enclosed in the rings, turned freely. So, when yokes of oxen began to draw the four-inch frame, they made the shaft revolve constantly, turning it by means of the pivots and rings.12. When they had thus transported all the shafts, and it, LINE: 1009, BOOK: The Ten Books on Architecture by Vitruvius, KEYWORD: pivot ring turn freeli yoke ox draw four inch frame made shaft revolv constantli turn mean pivot ring thu transport shaft
TEXT: became necessary to transport the architraves, Chersiphron's son Metagenes extended the same principle from the transportation of the shafts to the bringing down of the architraves. He made wheels, each about twelve feet in diameter, and enclosed the ends of the architraves in the wheels. In the ends he fixed pivots and rings in the same way. So when the four-inch frames were drawn by oxen, the wheels turned on the pivots enclosed in the rings, and the architraves, which were enclosed like axles in the wheels, soon reached the building, in the same way as the shafts. The rollers used for smoothing the walks in palaestrae will serve as an example of this method. But it could not have been employed unless the distance had been short; for it is not more than eight miles from the stone-quarries to the temple, and there is no hill, but an uninterrupted plain., LINE: 1010, BOOK: The Ten Books on Architecture by Vitruvius, KEYWORD: necessari transport architrav son extend principl transport shaft architrav made wheel twelv foot diamet end architrav wheel end fix pivot ring way four inch frame drawn ox wheel turn pivot ring architrav like axl wheel soon build way shaft roller use smooth walk serv exampl method could employ unless distanc short eight mile stone quarri templ hill uninterrupt plain

In our own times, however, when the pedestal of thecolossal Apollo in his temple had cracked with age, they were afraid that the statue would fall and be broken, and so they contracted for the cutting of a pedestal from the same quarries. The contract was taken by one Paconius. This pedestal was twelve feet long, eight feet wide, and six feet high. Paconius, with confident pride, did not transport it by the method of Metagenes, but determined to make a machine of a different sort, though on the same principle., LINE: 1011, BOOK: The Ten Books on Architecture by Vitruvius, KEYWORD: time howev pedest templ crack age afraid statu would fall broken contract cut pedest quarri contract wa taken one pedest wa twelv foot long eight foot wide six foot high confid pride transport method determin make machin differ sort though principl

He made wheels of about fifteen feet in diameter, and inthese wheels he enclosed the ends of the stone; then he fastenedtwo-inch crossbars from wheel to wheel round the stone, encompassing it, so that there was an interval of not more than one foot between bar and bar. Then he coiled a rope round the bars, yoked up his oxen, and began to draw on the rope. Consequently as it uncoiled, it did indeed cause the wheels to turn, but it could not draw them in a line straight along the road, but kept swerving out to one side. Hence it was necessary to draw the machine back again. Thus, by this drawing to and fro, Paconius got into such financial embarrassment that he became insolvent., LINE: 1012, BOOK: The Ten Books on Architecture by Vitruvius, KEYWORD: made wheel fifteen foot diamet wheel end stone inch crossbar wheel wheel round stone wa interv one foot bar bar coil rope round bar ox draw rope consequ uncoil inde caus wheel turn could draw line straight along road kept one side henc wa necessari draw machin back thu draw fro got financi embarrass insolv
TEXT: 15. I will digress a bit and explain how these stone-quarrieswere discovered. Pixodorus was a shepherd who lived in that vicinity. When the people of Ephesus were planning to build the temple of Diana in marble, and debating whether to get the marble from Paros, Proconnesus, Heraclea, or Thasos, Pixodorus drove out his sheep and was feeding his flock in that very spot. Then two rams ran at each other, and, each passing the other, one of them, after his charge, struck his horns against a rock, from which a fragment of extremely white colour was dislodged. So it is said that Pixodorus left his sheep in the mountains and ran down to Ephesus carrying the fragment, since that very thing was the question of the moment. Therefore they immediately decreed honours to him and changed his name, so that instead of Pixodorus he should be called Evangelus. And to this day the chief magistrate goes out to that very spot every month and offers sacrifice to him, and if he does not, he is punished., LINE: 1013, BOOK: The Ten Books on Architecture by Vitruvius, KEYWORD: digress bit explain stone discov wa shepherd live vicin peopl build templ marbl debat whether get marbl drove sheep wa feed flock spot two ram ran pass one charg struck horn rock fragment extrem white colour wa said left sheep mountain ran carri fragment sinc thing wa question moment therefor immedi name instead day chief magistr go spot everi month offer sacrific doe
TEXT: CHAPTER IIITHE ELEMENTS OF MOTION1. I have briefly set forth what I thought necessary about theprinciples of hoisting machines. In them two different things, unlike each other, work together, as elements of their motion and power, to produce these effects. One of them is the right line, which the Greeks term εὑθεια; the other is the circle, which the Greeks call κυκλωτἡ; but in point of fact, neither rectilinear without circular motion, nor revolutions, without rectilinear motion, can accomplish the raising of loads. I will explain this, so that it may be understood., LINE: 1014, BOOK: The Ten Books on Architecture by Vitruvius, KEYWORD: chapter element motion briefli set forth thought necessari hoist machin two differ thing unlik work togeth element motion power produc effect one right line term circl call point fact neither rectilinear without circular motion revolut without rectilinear motion accomplish rais load explain may understood
TEXT: 2. As centres, axles are inserted into the sheaves, and these arefastened in the blocks; a rope carried over the sheaves, drawn straight down, and fastened to a windlass, causes the load to move upward from its place as the handspikes are turned. The pivots of this windlass, lying as centres in right lines in its socket-pieces, and the handspikes inserted in its holes, make the load rise when the ends of the windlass revolve in a circle like a lathe. Just so, when an iron lever is applied to a weight which a great many hands cannot move, with the fulcrum, which the Greeks call ὑπομὁχλιον, lying as a centre in a right line under the lever, and with the tongue of the lever placed under the weight, one man's strength, bearing down upon the head of it, heaves up the weight., LINE: 1015, BOOK: The Ten Books on Architecture by Vitruvius, KEYWORD: axl insert sheaf block rope carri sheaf drawn straight windlass caus load move upward place handspik turn pivot windlass lie right line socket piec handspik insert hole make load rise end windlass revolv circl like lath iron lever appli weight great mani hand cannot move fulcrum call lie right line lever tongu lever weight one man strength bear upon head heav weight
TEXT: 3. For, as the shorter fore part of the lever goes under theweight from the fulcrum that forms the centre, the head of it, which is farther away from that centre, on being depressed, is made to describe a circular movement, and thus by pressure brings to an equilibrium the weight of a very great load by, LINE: 1016, BOOK: The Ten Books on Architecture by Vitruvius, KEYWORD: shorter fore part lever go fulcrum form head farther away depress made describ circular movement thu pressur equilibrium weight great load
TEXT: means of a few hands. Again, if the tongue of an iron lever is placed under a weight, and its head is not pushed down, but, on the contrary, is heaved up, the tongue, supported on the surface of the ground, will treat that as the weight, and the edge of the weight itself as the fulcrum. Thus, not so easily as by pushing down, but by motion in the opposite direction, the weight of the load will nevertheless be raised. If, therefore, the tongue of a lever lying on a fulcrum goes too far under the weight, and its head exerts its pressure too near the centre, it will not be able to elevate the weight, nor can it do so unless, as described above, the length of the lever is brought to equilibrium by the depression of its head., LINE: 1017, BOOK: The Ten Books on Architecture by Vitruvius, KEYWORD: mean hand tongu iron lever weight head contrari tongu surfac ground treat weight edg weight fulcrum thu easili push motion opposit direct weight load nevertheless rais therefor tongu lever lie fulcrum go far weight head pressur near abl elev weight unless length lever brought equilibrium depress head

This may be seen from the balances that we call steelyards.When the handle is set as a centre close to the end from which the scale hangs, and the counterpoise is moved along towards the other arm of the beam, shifting from point to point as it goes farther or even reaches the extremity, a small and inferior weight becomes equal to a very heavy object that is being weighed, on account of the equilibrium that is due to the levelling of the beam. Thus, as it withdraws from the centre, a small and comparatively light counterpoise, slowly turning the scale, makes a greater amount of weight rise gently upwards from below., LINE: 1018, BOOK: The Ten Books on Architecture by Vitruvius, KEYWORD: may seen balanc call steelyard handl set close end scale counterpois along toward arm beam shift point point go farther even reach extrem small inferior weight becom equal heavi object weigh account equilibrium due beam thu small compar light counterpois slowli turn scale make greater amount weight rise gentli upward

As a lever thrust under a weight is harder to manage, anddoes not put forth its strength, if the pressure is exerted at the centre, but easily raises the weight when the extreme end of it is pushed down, so sails that are only halfway up have less effect, but when they get farther away from the centre, and are hoisted to the very top of the mast, the pressure at the top forces the ship to make greater progress, though the wind is no stronger but just the same. Again, take the case of oars, which are fastened to the tholes by loops,—when they are pushed forward and drawn back by the hand, if the ends of the blades are at some distance from the centre, the oars foam with the waves of the sea and drive the ship forward in a straight line with a mighty impulse, while her prow cuts through the rare water., LINE: 1021, BOOK: The Ten Books on Architecture by Vitruvius, KEYWORD: lever thrust weight harder manag put forth strength pressur easili rais weight extrem end sail halfway less effect get farther away top mast pressur top forc ship make greater progress though wind take case oar thole loop forward drawn back hand end blade distanc oar foam wave sea drive ship forward straight line mighti impuls prow cut rare water
TEXT: 7. And when the heaviest burdens are carried on poles by fouror six porters at a time, they find the centres of balance at the very middle of the poles, so that, by distributing the dead weight of the burden according to a definitely proportioned division, each labourer may have an equal share to carry on his neck. For the poles, from which the straps for the burden of the four porters hang, are marked off at their centres by nails, to prevent the straps from slipping to one side. If they shift beyond the mark at the centre, they weigh heavily upon the place to which they have come nearer, like the weight of a steelyard when it moves from the point of equilibrium towards the end of the weighing apparatus., LINE: 1022, BOOK: The Ten Books on Architecture by Vitruvius, KEYWORD: burden carri pole six porter time find balanc middl pole dead weight burden accord definit proport divis may equal share carri neck pole strap burden four porter mark nail prevent strap slip one side shift beyond mark weigh heavili upon place come like weight steelyard move point equilibrium toward end weigh apparatu

But when their strength is not the same, and the stronger outdoes the other, the strap is shifted so as to make one side of the yoke longer, which helps the weaker ox. Thus, in the case of both poles and yokes, when the straps are not fastened at the middle, but at one side, the farther the strap moves from the middle, the shorter it makes one side, and the longer the other. So, if both ends are carried round in circles, using as a centre the point to which the strap has been brought, the longer end will describe a larger, and the shorter end a smaller circle., LINE: 1023, BOOK: The Ten Books on Architecture by Vitruvius, KEYWORD: way ox equal draught middl pole strength strap make one side yoke longer help thu case pole yoke strap middl one side farther strap move middl shorter make one side longer end carri round circl point strap ha brought longer end describ shorter end smaller circl

An axle is fashioned on a lathe or with the compasses, its ends are shod with iron hoops, and it carries round its middle a tympanum made of boards joined together. It rests on posts which have pieces of iron on them under the ends of the axle. In the interior of this tympanum there are eight crosspieces set at intervals, extending from the axle to the circumference of the tympanum, and dividing the space in the tympanum into equal compartments., LINE: 1026, BOOK: The Ten Books on Architecture by Vitruvius, KEYWORD: engin rais water speak tympanum although doe lift water high rais great quantiti quickli axl fashion lath compass end shod iron hoop carri round middl tympanum made board togeth rest post piec iron end axl interior tympanum eight crosspiec set interv extend axl circumfer tympanum divid space tympanum equal compart

At one side of it there are also holes, like those of a dovecot, next to the axle, one for each compartment. After being smeared with pitch like a ship, the thing is turned by the tread of men, and raising the water by means of the apertures in the face of the tympanum, delivers it through the holes next to the axle into a wooden trough set underneath, with a conduit joined to it. Thus, a large quantity of water is furnished for irrigation in gardens, or for supplying the needs of saltworks., LINE: 1027, BOOK: The Ten Books on Architecture by Vitruvius, KEYWORD: plank round face leav six admit water one side also hole like dovecot next axl one compart smear pitch like ship thing turn tread men rais water mean apertur face tympanum hole next axl wooden trough set underneath conduit thu larg quantiti water furnish irrig garden need saltwork

TEXT: CHAPTER VWATER WHEELS AND WATER MILLS1. Wheels on the principles that have been described above arealso constructed in rivers. Round their faces floatboards are fixed, which, on being struck by the current of the river, make the wheel turn as they move, and thus, by raising the water in the boxes and bringing it to the top, they accomplish the necessary work through being turned by the mere impulse of the river, without any treading on the part of workmen., LINE: 1030, BOOK: The Ten Books on Architecture by Vitruvius, KEYWORD: chapter wheel water mill wheel principl river round face fix struck current river make wheel turn move thu rais water box top accomplish necessari work turn mere impuls river without tread part workman

It is set vertically on its edge, and turns in the same plane with the wheel. Next to this larger drum there is a smaller one, also with teeth, but set horizontally, and this is attached (to the millstone). Thus the teeth of the drum which is fixed to the axle make the teeth of the horizontal drum move, and cause the mill to turn. A hopper, hanging over this contrivance, supplies the mill with corn, and meal is produced by the same revolution., LINE: 1031, BOOK: The Ten Books on Architecture by Vitruvius, KEYWORD: water mill turn principl everyth except drum teeth fix one end axl set vertic edg turn plane wheel next drum smaller one also teeth set horizont attach millston thu teeth drum fix axl make teeth horizont drum move caus mill turn hopper hang contriv suppli mill corn meal produc revolut

TEXT: CHAPTER VIITHE PUMP OF CTESIBIUS1. Next I must tell about the machine of Ctesibius, whichraises water to a height. It is made of bronze, and has at the bottom a pair of cylinders set a little way apart, and there is a pipe connected with each, the two running up, like the prongs of a fork, side by side to a vessel which is between the cylinders. In this vessel are valves, accurately fitting over the upper vents of the pipes, which stop up the ventholes, and keep what has been forced by pressure into the vessel from going down again., LINE: 1042, BOOK: The Ten Books on Architecture by Vitruvius, KEYWORD: chapter pump next must tell machin water height made bronz ha bottom pair cylind set littl way apart pipe connect two run like prong fork side side vessel cylind vessel valv accur fit upper vent pipe stop venthol keep ha forc pressur vessel go
TEXT: 2. Over the vessel a cowl is adjusted, like an inverted funnel,and fastened to the vessel by means of a wedge thrust through a staple, to prevent it from being lifted off by the pressure of the water that is forced in. On top of this a pipe is jointed, called the trumpet, which stands up vertically. Valves are inserted in the cylinders, beneath the lower vents of the pipes, and over the openings which are in the bottoms of the cylinders., LINE: 1043, BOOK: The Ten Books on Architecture by Vitruvius, KEYWORD: vessel cowl like invert funnel vessel mean wedg thrust stapl prevent pressur water forc top pipe joint trumpet stand vertic valv insert cylind beneath lower vent pipe open bottom cylind

Pistons smoothly turned, rubbed with oil, and inserted fromabove into the cylinders, work with their rods and levers upon the air and water in the cylinders, and, as the valves stop up the openings, force and drive the water, by repeated pressure and expansion, through the vents of the pipes into the vessel, from which the cowl receives the inflated currents, and sends them up through the pipe at the top; and so water can be supplied for a fountain from a reservoir at a lower level., LINE: 1044, BOOK: The Ten Books on Architecture by Vitruvius, KEYWORD: piston smoothli turn rub oil insert cylind work rod lever upon air water cylind valv stop open forc drive water repeat pressur expans vent pipe vessel cowl inflat current pipe top water fountain reservoir lower level

This, however, is not the only apparatus which Ctesibius issaid to have thought out, but many more of various kinds are shown by him to produce effects, borrowed from nature, by means of water pressure and compression of the air; as, for example, blackbirds singing by means of waterworks, and "angobatae," and figures that drink and move, and other things that are found to be pleasing to the eye and the ear., LINE: 1045, BOOK: The Ten Books on Architecture by Vitruvius, KEYWORD: howev apparatu thought mani variou kind shown produc effect natur mean water pressur compress air exampl blackbird sing mean figur drink move thing found pleas eye ear

TEXT: CHAPTER VIIITHE WATER ORGAN1. With regard to water organs, however, I shall not fail withall possible brevity and precision to touch upon their principles, and to give a sufficient description of them. A wooden base is constructed, and on it is set an altar-shaped box made of bronze. Uprights, fastened together like ladders, are set up on the base, to the right and to the left (of the altar). They hold the bronze pump-cylinders, the moveable bottoms of which, carefully turned on a lathe, have iron elbows fastened to their centres and jointed to levers, and are wrapped in fleeces of wool. In the tops of the cylinders are openings, each about three digits in, LINE: 1047, BOOK: The Ten Books on Architecture by Vitruvius, KEYWORD: chapter water organ regard water organ howev shall fail possibl breviti precis touch upon principl give suffici descript wooden base set altar shape box made bronz upright togeth like ladder set base right left altar hold bronz pump cylind bottom care turn lath iron elbow joint lever wrap fleec wool top cylind open three digit

TEXT: like an inverted funnel, under which there are cubes, each about three digits high, keeping a free space below between the lips of the regulator and the bottom of the altar. Tightly fixed on the neck of the regulator is the windchest, which supports the principal part of the contrivance, called in Greek the κανων μουσικὁς. Running longitudinally, there are four channels in it if it is a tetrachord; six, if it is a hexachord; eight, if it is an octachord., LINE: 1049, BOOK: The Ten Books on Architecture by Vitruvius, KEYWORD: like invert funnel cube three digit high keep free space lip regul bottom altar tightli fix neck regul support princip part contriv run longitudin four channel tetrachord six hexachord eight octachord
TEXT: 3. Each of the channels has a cock in it, furnished with an ironhandle. These handles, when turned, open ventholes from the windchest into the channels. From the channels to the canon there are vertical openings corresponding to ventholes in a board above, which board is termed πἱναξ in Greek. Between this board and the canon are inserted sliders, pierced with holes to correspond, and rubbed with oil so that they can be easily moved and slid back into place again. They close the above- mentioned openings, and are called the plinths. Their going and coming now closes and now opens the holes., LINE: 1050, BOOK: The Ten Books on Architecture by Vitruvius, KEYWORD: channel ha cock furnish handl turn open venthol channel channel canon vertic open correspond venthol board board board canon insert slider pierc hole correspond rub oil easili slid back place close open plinth go come close open hole

So, when the levers are raised, the elbows draw down thebottoms of the cylinders as far as they can go; and the dolphins, which are mounted on joints, let the cymbals fall into the cylinders, thus filling the interiors with air. Then the elbows, raising the bottoms within the cylinders by repeated and violent blows, and stopping the openings above by means of the cymbals, compress the air which is enclosed in the cylinders, and force it into the pipes, through which it runs into the regulator, and through its neck into the windchest. With a stronger motion of the levers, the air is still more compressed, streams through the apertures of the cocks, and fills the channels with wind., LINE: 1053, BOOK: The Ten Books on Architecture by Vitruvius, KEYWORD: lever rais elbow draw cylind far dolphin mount joint let cymbal fall cylind thu fill interior air elbow rais bottom within cylind repeat violent blow stop open mean cymbal compress air cylind forc pipe run regul neck motion lever air still compress stream apertur cock fill channel wind

TEXT: CHAPTER IXTHE HODOMETER1. The drift of our treatise now turns to a useful invention ofthe greatest ingenuity, transmitted by our predecessors, which enables us, while sitting in a carriage on the road or sailing by sea, to know how many miles of a journey we have accomplished. This will be possible as follows. Let the wheels of the carriage be each four feet in diameter, so that if a wheel has a mark made upon it, and begins to move forward from that mark in making its revolution on the surface of the road, it will have covered the definite distance of twelve and a half feet on reaching that mark at which it began to revolve., LINE: 1056, BOOK: The Ten Books on Architecture by Vitruvius, KEYWORD: chapter hodomet drift treatis turn use invent ingenu predecessor sit carriag road sail sea know mani mile journey accomplish possibl let wheel carriag four foot diamet wheel ha mark made upon begin move forward mark make revolut surfac road cover definit distanc twelv half foot reach mark revolv

Then, above this, let a case be firmly fastened to the body of the carriage, containing a revolving drum set on edge and mounted on an axle; on the face of the drum there are four hundred teeth, placed at equal intervals, and engaging the tooth of the drum below. The upper drum has, moreover, one tooth fixed to its side and standing out farther than the other teeth., LINE: 1057, BOOK: The Ten Books on Architecture by Vitruvius, KEYWORD: provid wheel let drum singl beyond face circumfer firmli inner side hub wheel let case firmli bodi carriag revolv drum set edg mount axl face drum four hundr teeth equal interv engag tooth drum upper drum ha moreov one tooth fix side stand farther teeth

Then, above, let there be a horizontal drum, similarlytoothed and contained in another case, with its teeth engaging the tooth fixed to the side of the second drum, and let as many holes be made in this (third) drum as will correspond to the number of miles—more or less, it does not matter—that a carriage can go in a day's journey.

TEXT: 4. Thus, as the wheel in going forward carries with it thelowest drum, and as the tooth of this at every revolution strikes against the teeth of the upper drum, and makes it move along, the result will be that the upper drum is carried round once for every four hundred revolutions of the lowest, and that the tooth fixed to its side pushes forward one tooth of the horizontal drum. Since, therefore, with four hundred revolutions of the lowest drum, the upper will revolve once, the progress made will be a distance of five thousand feet or one mile. Hence, every stone, making a ringing sound as it falls, will give warning that we have gone one mile. The number of stones gathered from beneath and counted, will show the number of miles in the day's journey., LINE: 1060, BOOK: The Ten Books on Architecture by Vitruvius, KEYWORD: thu wheel go forward carri drum tooth everi revolut strike teeth upper drum make move along result upper drum carri round everi four hundr revolut tooth fix side push forward one tooth horizont drum sinc therefor four hundr revolut drum upper revolv progress made distanc five thousand foot one mile henc everi stone make ring sound fall give warn gone one mile number stone beneath show number mile day journey
TEXT: 5. On board ship, also, the same principles may be employedwith a few changes. An axle is passed through the sides of the ship, with its ends projecting, and wheels are mounted on them, four feet in diameter, with projecting floatboards fastened round their faces and striking the water. The middle of the axle in the middle of the ship carries a drum with one tooth projecting beyond its circumference. Here a case is placed containing a drum with four hundred teeth at regular intervals, engaging the tooth of the drum that is mounted on the axle, and having also one other tooth fixed to its side and projecting beyond its circumference., LINE: 1061, BOOK: The Ten Books on Architecture by Vitruvius, KEYWORD: board ship also principl may chang axl side ship end project wheel mount four foot diamet project round face strike water middl axl middl ship carri drum one tooth project beyond circumfer case drum four hundr teeth regular interv engag tooth drum mount axl also one tooth fix side project beyond circumfer

Above, in another case fastened to the former, is ahorizontal drum toothed in the same way, and with its teeth engaging the tooth fixed to the side of the drum that is set on edge, so that one of the teeth of the horizontal drum is struck at each revolution of that tooth, and the horizontal drum is thus made to revolve in a circle. Let holes be made in the horizontal drum, in which holes small round stones are to be placed. In the receptacle or case containing that drum, let one hole be opened with a small pipe attached, through which a stone, as soon as the obstruction is removed, falls with a ringing sound into a bronze vessel., LINE: 1062, BOOK: The Ten Books on Architecture by Vitruvius, KEYWORD: anoth case former drum tooth way teeth engag tooth fix side drum set edg one teeth horizont drum struck revolut tooth horizont drum thu made revolv circl let hole made horizont drum hole small round stone receptacl case drum let one hole small pipe attach stone soon obstruct remov fall ring sound bronz vessel
TEXT: 7. So, when a ship is making headway, whether under oars orunder a gale of wind, the floatboards on the wheels will strike against the water and be driven violently back, thus turning the wheels; and they, revolving, will move the axle, and the axle the drum, the tooth of which, as it goes round, strikes one of the teeth of the second drum at each revolution, and makes it turn a little. So, when the floatboards have caused the wheels to revolve four hundred times, this drum, having turned round once, will strike a tooth of the horizontal drum with the tooth that is fixed to its side. Hence, every time the turning of the horizontal drum brings a stone to a hole, it will let the stone out through the pipe. Thus by the sound and the number, the length of the voyage will be shown in miles., LINE: 1063, BOOK: The Ten Books on Architecture by Vitruvius, KEYWORD: ship make headway whether oar gale wind wheel strike water driven violent back thu turn wheel revolv move axl axl drum tooth go round strike one teeth second drum revolut make turn littl wheel revolv four hundr time drum turn round strike tooth horizont drum tooth fix side henc everi time turn horizont drum stone hole let stone pipe thu sound number length voyag shown mile

For, if the height of the capitals is greater than their width—when they are called "high-tensioned,"—something should be taken from the arms, so that the more the tension is weakened by height of the capitals, the more the strength of the blow is increased by shortness of the arms. But if the capital is less high,—when the term "low-tensioned" is used,—the arms, on account of their strength, should be made a little longer, so that they may be drawn easily. Just as it takes four men to raise a load with a lever five feet long, and only two men to lift the same load with a ten-foot lever, so the longer the arms, the easier they are to draw, and the shorter, the harder., LINE: 1070, BOOK: The Ten Books on Architecture by Vitruvius, KEYWORD: engin accord addit diminut height capit greater width high someth taken arm tension height capit strength blow short arm capit less high term low use arm account strength made littl longer may drawn easili take four men rais load lever five foot long two men lift load ten foot lever longer arm easier draw shorter harder

Then they are wedged tightly into the holes so that they cannot slacken. So, in the same manner, they are passed through to the other side, and stretched taut on the windlasses by means of the handspikes until they give the same sound.

TEXT: down the top courses of stones, and thus, step by step in regular order, they demolished the entire redoubt.2. Afterwards a carpenter from Tyre, Bright by name and bynature, was led by this invention into setting up a mast from which he hung another crosswise like a steelyard, and so, by swinging it vigorously to and fro, he threw down the wall of Cadiz. Geras of Chalcedon was the first to make a wooden platform with wheels under it, upon which he constructed a framework of uprights and crosspieces, and within it he hung the ram, and covered it with oxhide for the better protection of the men who were stationed in the machine to batter the wall. As the machine made but slow progress, he first gave it the name of the tortoise of the ram., LINE: 1086, BOOK: The Ten Books on Architecture by Vitruvius, KEYWORD: top cours stone thu step step regular order entir redoubt afterward carpent tyre bright name wa led invent set mast hung anoth crosswis like steelyard swing vigor fro threw wall wa first make wooden platform wheel upon framework upright crosspiec within hung ram cover oxhid better protect men machin batter wall machin made slow progress first gave name tortois ram

Diades shows in his writings that he invented moveable towers, which he used also to take apart and carry round with the army, and likewise the borer, and the scaling machine, by means of which one can cross over to the wall on a level with the top of it, as well as the destroyer called the raven, or by others the crane., LINE: 1087, BOOK: The Ten Books on Architecture by Vitruvius, KEYWORD: first step taken toward kind afterward son wa besieg wa mani varieti made pupil show write tower use also take apart carri round armi likewis borer scale machin mean one cross wall level top well destroy raven crane

Issuing up and above the middle of the roof for not less than two cubits was a gable, and on this was reared a small tower four stories high, in which, on the top floor, scorpiones and catapults were set up, and on the lower floors a great quantity of water was stored, to put out any fire that might be thrown on the tortoise. Inside of this was set the machinery of the ram, termed in Greek κριοδὁχη, in which was placed a roller, turned on a lathe, and the ram, being set on top of this, produced its great effects when swung to and fro by means of ropes.

From the head to the very heel of the beam were stretched cables, three in number and eight digits thick, fastened just as in a ship from stem to stern continuously, and these cables were bound with cross girdles a foot and a quarter apart. Over these the whole ram was wrapped with rawhide.

Likewise, the projecting end of the ram had a box framedand constructed of boards, in which was stretched a net made of rather large ropes, over the rough surfaces of which one easily reached the wall without the feet slipping. And this machine moved in six directions, forward (and backward), also to the right or left, and likewise it was elevated by extending it upwards and depressed by inclining it downwards. The machine could be elevated to a height sufficient to throw down a wall of about one hundred feet, and likewise in its thrust it covered a space from right to left of not less than one hundred feet.

TEXT: shrewd, hastily conceived plan, without the aid of machines, as is said to have been the experience of the Rhodians.3. For Diognetus was a Rhodian architect, to whom, as anhonour, was granted out of the public treasury a fixed annual payment commensurate with the dignity of his art. At this time an architect from Aradus, Callias by name, coming to Rhodes, gave a public lecture, and showed a model of a wall, over which he set a machine on a revolving crane with which he seized an helepolis as it approached the fortifications, and brought it inside the wall. The Rhodians, when they had seen this model, filled with admiration, took from Diognetus the yearly grant and transferred this honour to Callias., LINE: 1111, BOOK: The Ten Books on Architecture by Vitruvius, KEYWORD: shrewd hastili plan without aid machin said experi wa architect wa public treasuri fix annual payment commensur digniti art time architect name come gave public lectur model wall set machin revolv crane fortif brought insid wall seen model fill admir took yearli grant transfer
TEXT: 4. Meanwhile, king Demetrius, who because of his stubborncourage was called Poliorcetes, making war on Rhodes, brought with him a famous Athenian architect named Epimachus. He constructed at enormous expense, with the utmost care and exertion, an helepolis one hundred and thirty-five feet high and sixty feet broad. He strengthened it with hair and rawhide so that it could withstand the blow of a stone weighing three hundred and sixty pounds shot from a ballista; the machine itself weighed three hundred and sixty thousand pounds. When Callias was asked by the Rhodians to construct a machine to resist this helepolis, and to bring it within the wall as he had promised, he said that it was impossible., LINE: 1112, BOOK: The Ten Books on Architecture by Vitruvius, KEYWORD: meanwhil king wa make war brought famou architect enorm expens utmost care exert one hundr thirti five foot high sixti foot broad hair rawhid could withstand blow stone weigh three hundr sixti pound shot ballista machin weigh three hundr sixti thousand pound wa construct machin resist bring within wall said wa imposs

TEXT: 6. So too, in some models it is seen how they appearpracticable on the smallest scale and likewise on a larger. And so the Rhodians, in the same manner, deceived by the same reasoning, inflicted injury and insult on Diognetus. Therefore, when they saw the enemy stubbornly hostile, slavery threatening them because of the machine which had been built to take the city, and that they must look forward to the destruction of their state, they fell at the feet of Diognetus, begging him to come to the aid of the fatherland. He at first refused., LINE: 1115, BOOK: The Ten Books on Architecture by Vitruvius, KEYWORD: model seen scale likewis manner reason injuri insult therefor saw enemi stubbornli hostil slaveri threaten machin built take citi must look forward destruct state fell foot beg come aid fatherland first

When these terms had been agreed upon, he pierced the wall in the place where the machine was going to approach it, and ordered all to bring forth from both public and private sources all the water, excrement, and filth, and to pour it in front of the wall through pipes projecting through this opening. After a great amount of water, filth, and excrement had been poured out during the night, on the next day the helepolis moving up, before it could reach the wall, came to a stop in the swamp made by the moisture, and could not be moved forwards, nor later even backwards. And so Demetrius, when he saw that he had been baffled by the wisdom of Diognetus, withdrew with his fleet., LINE: 1116, BOOK: The Ten Books on Architecture by Vitruvius, KEYWORD: free born maiden young men came implor condit took machin properti term agre upon pierc wall place machin wa go approach order bring forth public privat sourc water excrement filth pour front wall pipe project open great amount water filth excrement night next day move could reach wall came stop swamp made moistur could forward later even backward saw wisdom fleet
TEXT: 8. Then the Rhodians, freed from the war by the cunning ofDiognetus, thanked him publicly, and decorated him with all honours and distinctions. Diognetus brought that helepolis intothe city, set it up in a public place, and put on it an inscription: "Diognetus out of the spoils of the enemy dedicated this gift to the people." Therefore, in works of defence, not merely machines, but, most of all, wise plans must be prepared., LINE: 1117, BOOK: The Ten Books on Architecture by Vitruvius, KEYWORD: freed war cun publicli decor distinct brought citi set public place put inscript spoil enemi gift peopl therefor work defenc mere machin wise plan must prepar
TEXT: 9. Likewise at Chios, when the enemy had prepared stormingbridges on their ships, the Chians, by night, carried out earth, sand, and stones into the sea before their walls. So, when the enemy, on the next day, tried to approach the walls, their ships grounded on the mound beneath the water, and could not approach the wall nor withdraw, but pierced with fire-darts were burned there. Again, when Apollonia was being besieged, and the enemy were thinking, by digging mines, to make their way within the walls without exciting suspicion, and this was reported by scouts to the people of Apollonia, they were much disturbed and alarmed by the news, and having no plans for defence, they lost courage, because they could not learn either the time or the definite place where the enemy would come out., LINE: 1118, BOOK: The Ten Books on Architecture by Vitruvius, KEYWORD: likewis enemi prepar ship night carri earth sand stone sea wall enemi next day tri approach wall ship ground mound beneath water could approach wall withdraw pierc fire dart burn wa besieg enemi think dig mine make way within wall without excit suspicion wa scout peopl much disturb alarm news plan defenc lost courag could learn either time definit place enemi would come
TEXT: 10. But at this time Trypho, the Alexandrine architect, wasthere. He planned a number of countermines inside the wall, and extending them outside the wall beyond the range of arrows, hung up in all of them brazen vessels. The brazen vessels hanging in one of these mines, which was in front of a mine of the enemy, began to ring from the strokes of their iron tools. So from this it was ascertained where the enemy, pushing their mines, thought to enter. The line being thus found out, he prepared kettles of hot water, pitch, human excrement, and sand heated to a glow. Then, at night, he pierced a number of holes, and pouring the mixture suddenly through them, killed all the enemy who were engaged in this work., LINE: 1119, BOOK: The Ten Books on Architecture by Vitruvius, KEYWORD: time architect number countermin insid wall extend outsid wall beyond rang arrow hung brazen vessel brazen vessel hang one mine wa front mine enemi ring stroke iron tool wa enemi push mine thought enter line thu found prepar kettl hot water pitch human excrement sand glow night pierc number hole pour mixtur suddenli enemi engag work
TEXT: 11. In the same manner, when Marseilles was being besieged,and they were pushing forward more than thirty mines, the people of Marseilles, distrusting the entire moat in front of their wall, lowered it by digging it deeper. Thus all the mines found their outlet in the moat. In places where the moat could not be dug they constructed, within the walls, a basin of enormous length and breadth, like a fish pond, in front of the place where the mines were being pushed, and filled it from wells and from the port. And so, when the passages of the mine were suddenly opened, the immense mass of water let in undermined the supports, and all who were within were overpowered by the mass of water and the caving in of the mine., LINE: 1120, BOOK: The Ten Books on Architecture by Vitruvius, KEYWORD: manner wa besieg push forward thirti mine peopl entir moat front wall dig thu mine found outlet moat place moat could dug within wall basin enorm length breadth like fish pond front place mine fill well port passag mine suddenli immens mass water let support within mass water cave mine
TEXT: 12. Again, when a rampart was being prepared against the wallin front of them, and the place was heaped up with felled trees and works placed there, by shooting at it with the ballistae red- hot iron bolts they set the whole work on fire. And when a ram- tortoise had approached to batter down the wall, they let down a noose, and when they had caught the ram with it, winding it over a drum by turning a capstan, having raised the head of the ram, they did not allow the wall to be touched, and finally they destroyed the entire machine by glowing fire-darts and the blows of ballistae. Thus by such victory, not by machines but in opposition to the principle of machines, has the freedom of states been preserved by the cunning of architects., LINE: 1121, BOOK: The Ten Books on Architecture by Vitruvius, KEYWORD: rampart wa prepar front place wa tree work shoot ballista red hot iron bolt set whole work fire ram tortois batter wall let noos caught ram wind drum turn capstan rais head ram allow wall touch final entir machin glow fire dart blow ballista thu victori machin opposit principl machin ha freedom state cun architect

TEXT: FINISSCAMILLI IMPARES (BOOK III, ch. 4)No passage in Vitruvius has given rise to so much discussionor been the subject of such various interpretations as this phrase. The most reasonable explanation of its meaning seems to be that of Émile Burnouf, at one time Director of the French School at Athens, published in the Revue Générale del' Architecture for 1875, as a note to a brief article of his on the explanation of the curves of Greek Doric buildings. This explanation was accepted by Professor Morgan, who called my attention to it in a note dated December 12, 1905. It has also quite recently been adopted by Professor Goodyear in his interesting book on Greek Refinements., LINE: 1123, BOOK: The Ten Books on Architecture by Vitruvius, KEYWORD: book passag ha given rise much subject variou interpret phrase reason explan mean one time director school revu general architectur note brief articl explan curv build explan wa accept professor morgan attent note ha also quit recent adopt professor goodyear interest book refin
TEXT: Burnouf would translate it nivelettes inégales, "unequallevellers." He states that in many parts of France in setting a long course of cut stone the masons make use of a simple device consisting of three pointed blocks of equal height used as levellers, of which two are placed one at each extremity of the course, while the third is used to level the stones, as they are successively set in place, by setting it upon the stone to be set and sighting across the other two levellers. If two "levellers" of equal height are used with a third of less height placed at the centre of the course, with perhaps others of intermediate height used at intermediate points, it would obviously be equally easy to set out a curved course, as, for instance, the curved stylobate of the Parthenon which rises about three inches in its length of one hundred feet. By a simple calculation any desired curve could be laid out in this way. The word scamillus is a diminutive of scamnum, a mounting-block or bench., LINE: 1124, BOOK: The Ten Books on Architecture by Vitruvius, KEYWORD: would translat state mani part set long cours cut stone mason make use simpl devic three point block equal height use two one extrem cours third use level stone success set place set upon stone set sight across two two equal height use third less height cours perhap intermedi height use intermedi point would obvious equal easi set curv cours instanc curv stylob rise three inch length one hundr foot simpl calcul desir curv could laid way word diminut mount block bench

TEXT:  Penrose and most writers who followed him supposed the "scamilli impares" to be projections or offsets on the stylobate required on account of the curves to bring the column into relation with the architraves above, and similar offsets of unequal or sloping form were supposed to be required above the abaci of the capitals, but such offsets, although sometimes existing, have no obvious connection with the passage in Vitruvius., LINE: 1130, BOOK: The Ten Books on Architecture by Vitruvius, KEYWORD: writer suppos project offset stylob account curv bring column relat architrav similar offset unequ slope form suppos abacu capit offset although sometim obviou connect passag

TEXT: Assuming, as I think we must, that the horizontal curvature ofthe stylobate in such buildings as the Parthenon was intended and carefully planned, Burnouf's explanation fits the case precisely and makes this passage of Vitruvius straightforward and simple. This can be said of no other explanation, for all the others leave the passage obscure and more or less nonsensical. Durm's attempt to refer the passage to the case of the temple with a podium which has just been spoken of by Vitruvius is somewhat forced, or at least unnecessary. Clearly the passage refers to stylobates in general; but Reber also so translates and punctuates as to make the use of the "scamilli impares" refer, LINE: 1133, BOOK: The Ten Books on Architecture by Vitruvius, KEYWORD: assum think must horizont curvatur stylob build wa intend care explan fit case precis make passag straightforward simpl said explan leav passag obscur less nonsens attempt refer passag case templ podium ha spoken somewhat forc least unnecessari clearli passag gener also make use refer

One may finally refer to the ingenious but improbable explanation of Choisy, who translates it echelons impairs, and explains them as offsets arranged according to the odd numbers, nombres impairs, i. e., offsets varying at equal intervals in the proportion of 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, etc., and which he claims was applied also to the entasis of columns., LINE: 1134, BOOK: The Ten Books on Architecture by Vitruvius, KEYWORD: case templ built manner podium result explan still leaf passag obscur unsatisfactori one may final refer ingeni improb explan echelon offset accord odd number offset equal interv proport claim wa appli also entasi column
