TEXT:  I wish I could make clear how his provincial origins and his familiarity with the things of the earth affected his intellectual life and influenced the course of his philo­ sophical reflections. Owing to his courageous efforts, Bache­ lard finally succeeded in giving himself a university education, got all the university degrees one can get and ended as a university professor; yet, unlike most of us, a� least in France, he never allowed himself to become molded by the traditional ways of thinking to which universities unavoidably begin by submitting their students., LINE: 42, BOOK: The Poetics of Space by Gaston Bachelard, KEYWORD: wish could make clear provinci origin familiar thing earth affect intellectu life cours sophic reflect owe courag effort bach lard final give univers educ got univers degre one get end univers professor yet unlik least never becom tradit way think univers unavoid begin student

TEXT:  Among them, one title at least should be mentioned at this place, namely The Experience of Space in Con­ temporary Physics. What I want to make dear, however, is that, as a university professor his whole career was founded upon his philosophical critique of scientific knowledge and his conception of a free type of rationalism, quite different from the abstract mode of thinking which the word usuaIIy designates, and wholly bent upon the art of using reason as an instrument to achieve an always closer approach to concrete reality., LINE: 47, BOOK: The Poetics of Space by Gaston Bachelard, KEYWORD: among one titl least place name experi space con temporari physic want make dear howev univers professor whole career wa upon philosoph critiqu scientif knowledg concept free type ration quit differ abstract mode think word wholli bent upon art reason instrument achiev alway closer approach concret realiti

TEXT: xvii introductionTo say that the poetic image is independent of causality is to make a rather serious statement. But the causes cited by psychologists and psychoanalysts can never really explain the wholly unexpected nature of the new image, any more than they can explain the attraction it holds for a mind that is foreign to the process of its creation. The poet does not confer the past of his image upon me, and yet his image immediately takes root in me. The communicability of an unusual image is a fact of great ontological significance. We shall return to this question of communion through brief, isolated, rapid actions. Images excite us-afterwards-but they are not the phenomena of an excitement. In all psy­ chological research, we can, of course, bear in mind psycho­ analytical methods for determining the personality of a poet, and thus find a measure of the pressures-but above, LINE: 84, BOOK: The Poetics of Space by Gaston Bachelard, KEYWORD: say poetic imag independ causal make rather seriou statement caus psychologist psychoanalyst never realli explain wholli unexpect natur new imag explain attract hold mind foreign process creation poet doe past imag upon yet imag immedi take root communic unusu imag fact great ontolog signific shall return question communion brief isol rapid action imag excit afterward phenomenon excit research cours bear mind analyt method person poet thu find measur pressur

But the poetic act itself, the sudden image, the flare-up of being in the imagination, are in­ accessible to such investigations. In order to clarify the problem of the poetic image philosophically, we shall have to have recourse to a phenomenology of the imagination. By this should be understood a study of the phenomenon of the poetic image when it emerges into the consciousness as a direct product of the heart, soul and being of man, apprehended in his actuality., LINE: 91, BOOK: The Poetics of Space by Gaston Bachelard, KEYWORD: oppress poet ha subject cours life poetic act sudden imag flare imagin access investig order clarifi problem poetic imag philosoph shall recours phenomenolog imagin understood studi phenomenon poetic imag conscious direct product heart soul man actual
TEXT: III shall perhaps be asked why, departing from my former point of view, I now seek a phenomenological determination of images. In my earlier works on the subject of the imagina­ tion, I did, in fact, consider it preferable to maintain as objective a position as possible with regard to the images of the four material elements, the four principles of the intuitive cosmogonies, and, faithful to my habits as a philosopher of science, I tried to consider images without attempting personal interpretation., LINE: 92, BOOK: The Poetics of Space by Gaston Bachelard, KEYWORD: shall perhap former point view seek determin imag work subject fact consid prefer maintain object posit possibl regard imag four materi element four principl intuit cosmogoni faith habit philosoph scienc tri consid imag without person interpret

TEXT:  I have come to realize how difficult it is to break away from this "prudence." To say that one has left certain intellectual habits behind is easy enough, but how is it to be achieved? For a rationalist, this constitutes a minor daily crisis, a sort of split in one's thinking which, even though its object be partial-a mere image-has none the less great psychic repercussions., LINE: 94, BOOK: The Poetics of Space by Gaston Bachelard, KEYWORD: come realiz difficult break away prudenc say one ha left certain intellectu habit behind easi enough rationalist minor daili crisi sort split one think even though object partial mere imag ha none less great psychic repercuss
TEXT:  However, this minor cultural crisis, this crisis on the simple level of a new image, contains the entire paradox of a phenomenology of the imagination, which is: how can an image, at times very unusual, appear to be a concentration of the entire psyche?

TEXT:  These subjectivities and transsubjectivities cannot be determined once and for all, for the poetic image is essentially variational, and not, as in the case of the concept, constitutive.

TEXT: IIISince a phenomenological inquiry on poetry aspires to go so far and so deep, because of methodological obligations, it must go beyond the sentimental resonances with which we receive (more or less richly-whether this richness be within ourselves or within the poem) a work of art. This is where the phenomenological doublet of resonances and repercussions must be sensitized. The resonances are dis­ persed on the different planes of our life in the world, while the repercussions invite us to give greater depth to our own existence. In the resonance we hear the poem, in the re­ verberations we speak it, it is our own. The reverberations bring about a change of being. It is as though the poet's being were our being. The multiplicity of resonances then issues from the reverberations' unity of being. Or, to put it more simply, this is an impression that all impassioned poetry-lovers know well: the poem possesses us entirely., LINE: 125, BOOK: The Poetics of Space by Gaston Bachelard, KEYWORD: inquiri poetri far deep methodolog oblig must beyond sentiment reson receiv less richli whether rich within within poem work art doublet reson repercuss must reson di differ plane life world repercuss invit give greater depth exist reson hear poem speak reverber bring chang though poet multipl reson issu reverber uniti put simpli impress impass poetri lover know well poem entir

Thus the psychoanalysis of a work of art moves away from its object and carries the discussion into a domain of general human interest, which is not in the least peculiar to the artist and, particularly, has no importance for his art."1 Merely with a view to summarizing this discussion, I should like to make a polemical remark, although indulg­ ing in polemics is not one of my habits.

On principle, phenome­ nology liquidates the past and confronts what is new. Even in an art like painting. which bears witness to a skill, the important successes take place independently of skill. In a study of the painting of Charles Lapicque, by Jean Lescure, we read: "Although his work gives evidence of wide culture and knowledge of all the dynamic expressions of space, they are not applied, they are not made into recipes. . . .

TEXT:  In Bergson's Matiere et Memoire (Matter and Mem­ ory), in which the image concept is very widely treated, there is only one reference (on p. 198) to the productive imagination. This production remains, therefore, an act of lesser freedom, that has no relation to the great free acts stressed by Bergsonian philosophy., LINE: 216, BOOK: The Poetics of Space by Gaston Bachelard, KEYWORD: matter mem ori imag concept wide one refer product imagin product remain therefor act lesser freedom ha relat great free act philosophi
TEXT:  In this short passage, the philosopher refers to the "play of fantasy" and the various images that derive from it as "so many liberties that the mind takes with nature." But these liberties, in the plural, do not commit our being; they do not add to the language nor do they take it out of its utilitarian role., LINE: 217, BOOK: The Poetics of Space by Gaston Bachelard, KEYWORD: short passag philosoph play fantasi variou imag deriv mani liberti mind take natur liberti plural commit add languag take utilitarian role
TEXT:  They really are so much "play." Indeed, the imagination hardly lends iridescence to our recollections. In this domain of poeticized memory, Bergson is well this side of Proust.

TEXT:  I propose, on the contrary, to consider the imagination as a major power of human nature. To be sure, there is nothing to be gained by saying that the imagination is the faculty of producing images.

TEXT:  By the swiftness of its actions, the imagination separates us from the past as well as from reality; it faces the future. To the junction of reality, wise in experience of the past, as it is defined by traditional psychology, should be added a junction of unreality, which is equally positive, as I tried to show in certain of my earlier works., LINE: 220, BOOK: The Poetics of Space by Gaston Bachelard, KEYWORD: swift action imagin separ past well realiti face futur junction realiti wise experi past defin tradit psycholog ad junction unreal equal posit tri show certain work

TEXT:  We are offered a veritable cure of rhythmo-analysis through the poem, which inter­ weaves real and unreal, and gives dynamism to language by means of the dual activity of signification and poetry.

In the present volume, my field of examination has the advantage of being well cir­ cumscribed. Indeed, the images I want to examine are the quite simple images of felicitous space. In this orientation, these investigations would deserve to be called topophilia. They seek to determine the human value of the sorts of space that may be grasped, that may be defended against adverse forces, the space we love. For diverse reasons, and with the differences entailed by poetic shadings, this is eulogized space.

TEXT:  The two chapters that I devoted to nests and shells--the two refuges of vertebrates and invertebrates-bear witness to an activity of the imagination which is hardly curbed by the reality of objects.

TEXT: vA house constitutes a body of images that give mankind proofs or illusions of stability. We are constantly re-imagin­ ing its reality: to distinguish all these images would be to describe the soul of the house; it would mean developing a veritable psychology of the house. To bring order into these images, I believe that we should consider two principal connecting themes: 1) A house is imagined as a vertical being. It rises upward. It differen­ tiates itself in terms of its verticality. It is one of the appeals to our consciousness of verticality. 2) A house is imagined as a conc�ntrated being. It appeals to our consciousness of centrality.1 These themes are no doubt very abstractly stated. But with examples, it is not hard to recognize their psychologi­ cally concrete nature., LINE: 370, BOOK: The Poetics of Space by Gaston Bachelard, KEYWORD: hous bodi imag give mankind proof illus stabil constantli ing realiti distinguish imag would describ soul hous would mean verit psycholog hous bring order imag believ consid two princip theme hous vertic rise upward term vertic one appeal conscious vertic hous appeal conscious central theme doubt abstractli state exampl hard recogn concret natur

TEXT: This tower and its underground cellars extend the house we have just been studying in both directions. For us, this house represents an increase in the verticality of the more modest houses that, in order to satisfy our daydreams, have to be differentiated in height. If I were the architect of an oneiric house, I should hesitate between a three-story house and one with four. A three-story house, which is the simplest as regards essential height, has a cellar, a ground floor and an attic; while a four-story house puts a floor between the ground floor and the attic. One floor more, and our dreams become blurred. In the oneiric house, topo­ analysis only knows how to count to three or four. Then there are the stairways: one to three or four of them, all different. We always go down the one that leads to the cellar, and it is this going down that we remember, that characterizes its oneirism.

TEXT: (Of a gaze imprisoned Between its four stone walls.)In Henri Bosco�s novel, Hyacinthe which, together with another story, Le Jardin d'Hyacinthe (Hyacinth�s Garden), constitutes one of the most astounding psychological novels of our time, a lamp is waiting in the window, and through it, the house, too, is waiting. The lamp is the symbol of prolonged waiting. By means of the light in that far-off house, the house sees, keeps vigil, vigilantly waits. When I let myself drift into the intoxication of inverting daydreams and reality, that faraway house with its light becomes for me, before me, a house that is looking out­ its turn now!-through the keyhole. Yes, there is someone in that house who is keeping watch, a man is working there while I dream away.

TEXT: Although at heart a city man, Baudelaire sensed the in­ creased intimacy of a house when it is besieged by winter. In Les paradis artificiels (p. 280) he speaks of Thomas de Quincey's joy when, a prisoner of winter, he read Kant, with the help of the idealism furnished by opium. The scene takes place in a cottage in Wales. IIUne jolie habita­ tion ne ,.end-eUe pas l'hiver plus poetique, et l'hiver n'aug­ mente-t-U pas la poesie de l'habitation'!

TEXT: The image of these houses that integrate the wind, aspire to the lightness of air, and bear on the tree of their im­ possible growth a nest all ready to flyaway, may perhaps be rejected by a positive, realistic mind. But it is of value for a general thesis on the imagination because, without the poet's knowing it apparently, it is touched by the at­ traction of opposites, which lends dynamism to the great archetypes. In an articlel in the Eranos yearbook, Erich Neumann shows that all strongly terrestrial beings-and a house is strongly terrestrial-are nevertheless subject to the attractions of an aereal, celestial world. The well-rooted house likes to have a branch that is sensitive to the wind, or an attic that can hear the rustle of leaves.

TEXT: This house, as I see it, is a sort of airy structure that moves about on the breath of time. It really is open to the wind of another time. It seems as though it could greet us every day of our lives in order to give us confidence in life. In my daydreaming, I associate these lines by Jean Laroche with the passage in which Rene Char2 dreams in "a room that grew buoyant and, little by little, expanded into the vast stretches of travel." If the Creator listened to poets, He would create a flying turtle that would carry off into the blue the great safeguards of earth. If further proof of these weightless houses were needed, there is a poem by Louis Guillaume, entitled uMaison de Vent"S (Wind House), in which the poet dreams as follows:, LINE: 655, BOOK: The Poetics of Space by Gaston Bachelard, KEYWORD: hous see sort airi structur move breath time realli open wind anoth time though could greet everi day life order give confid life associ line jean passag char dream room grew buoyant littl littl expand vast stretch travel creator poet would creat fli turtl would carri blue great safeguard earth proof weightless hous poem vent wind hous poet dream

For the positive man, every­ thing that is unreal is alike, the forms being submerged and drowned in unreality; and the only houses that are capable of possessing individuality are real ones.

For how forcefully they prove to us that the houses that were lost forever continue to live on in us; that they insist in us in order to live again, as though they expected us to give them a supplement of living. How much better we should live in the old house todayl How suddenly our memories assume a living possibility of being! We consider the past, and a sort of remorse at not having lived pro­ foundly enough in the old house fills our hearts, comes up from the past, overwhelms us.

TEXT: When two strange images meet, two images that are the work of two poets pursuing separate dreams, they appar­ ently strengthen each other. In fact, this convergence of two exceptional images furnishes as it were a counter­ check for phenomenological analysis. The image loses its gratuitousness; the free play of the imagination ceases to be a form of anarchy. I should like, therefore, to compare Goyen's image in the House of Breath with one that I quoted in my book La terre et les reveries du repos (p. 96) and which, at the time, I was unable to relate to any other.

But for the poetry lover who ceads with joy and imagination, it is a red-letter day when he can hear echoes of the lost house in two registers. The old house, for those who know how to listen, is a sort of geometry of echoes. The voices of the past do not sound the same in the big room as in the little bed chamber, and calls on the stairs have yet another sound. Among the most difficult memories, well beyond any geometry that can be drawn, we must recapture the quality of the light; then come the sweet smells that linger in the empty rooms, setting an aerial seal on each room in the house of memory.

But from the moment the casket is opened, dialectics no longer exist. The outside is effaced with one stroke, an atmosphere of novelty and surprise reigns. The outside has no more meaning.

The two images: the calm nest and the old home, weave the sturdy web of intimacy on the dream loom. And the images are all sim­ ple ones, with no attempt at picturesqueness. The poet rightly thought that, at the mention of a nest, a bird's song, and the charms that take us back to the old home, to the first home, a sort of musical chord would sound in the soul of the reader. But in order to make so gentle a com­ parison between house and nest, one must have lost the house that stood for happiness. So there is also an alas in this song of tenderness.

TEXT: VIIThus values alter facts. The moment we love an image, it cannot remain the copy of a fact. One of the greatest of dreamers of winged life, Jules Michelet, has given us fresh evidence of this. And yet he only devotes a few pages to "bird architecture." But these are pages that think and dream at the same time. According to Michelet, a bird is a worker without tools. It has "neither the hand of the squirrel, nor the teeth of the beaver." "In reality," he writes, "a bird's tool is its own body, that is, its breast, with which it presses and tightens its materials until they have become absolutely pliant, well-blended and adapted to the general plan:'!, LINE: 965, BOOK: The Poetics of Space by Gaston Bachelard, KEYWORD: valu alter fact moment love imag cannot remain copi fact one dreamer wing life ha given fresh evid yet page bird architectur page think dream time accord bird worker without tool ha neither hand squirrel teeth beaver realiti bird tool bodi breast press materi becom absolut pliant well blend gener plan

We definitely saw it, but we say that it was well hidden. This center of animal life is concealed by the immense volume of vegetable life. The nest is a lyrical bouquet of leaves. It participates in the peace of the vegetable world. It is a point in the atmosphere of happiness that always surrounds large trees.

When a philosopher considers a nest, he calms himself by meditating on the subject of his own being in the calm world being. And if we were to translate the absolute naivete of his daydream into the metaphysical language of today, a dreamer might say that the world is the nest of mankind. For the world is a nest, and an immense power holds the inhabitants of the world in this nest.

Ammonites built their homes around the axis of a logarithmic spiral.

TEXT: XIIWith nests, with shells-at the risk of wearying the reader­ I have multiplied the images that seem to me to illustrate the function of inhabiting in elementary forms which may be too remotely imagined. Here one senses clearly that this is a mixed problem of imagination and observation. I have simply wanted to show that whenever life seeks to shelter, protect, cover or hide itself, the imagination sympathizes with the being that inhabits the protected space. The imagination experiences protection in all its nuances of security, from life in the most material of shells, to more subtle concealment through imitation of surfaces. As the poet Noel Arnaud expresses it, being seeks dissimulation in similarity.1 To be in safety under cover of a color is carry­ ing the tranquility of inhabiting to the point of culmina­ tion, not to say, imprudence. Shade, too, can be inhabited., LINE: 1198, BOOK: The Poetics of Space by Gaston Bachelard, KEYWORD: nest shell risk weari reader imag seem illustr function elementari form may remot one clearli mix problem imagin observ simpli show whenev life seek shelter protect cover hide imagin space imagin experi protect nuanc secur life materi shell subtl conceal imit surfac poet noel express seek dissimul similar safeti cover color carri ing tranquil point say imprud shade inhabit

Incidentally, I should like to point out the power that an adjective acquires, as soon as it is applied to life. A gloomy life, or a gloomy person, marks an entire universe with more than just a pervading coloration. Even things become crystallizations of sadness, regret or nostalgia. And when a philosopher looks to poets, to a great poet like Milosz, for lessons in how to individualize the world, he soon becomes convinced that the world is not so much, LINE: 1274, BOOK: The Poetics of Space by Gaston Bachelard, KEYWORD: ivin fragment sought sent unusu complet experi gloomi day dream daydream human motion less corner find world grown old worn incident like point power adject soon appli life gloomi life gloomi person mark entir univers pervad color even thing becom sad regret nostalgia philosoph look poet great poet like lesson individu world soon becom convinc world much

We feel that we should like to live there, between the very lines of the engraved drawing. At times, too, the phan­ tasm that impels us to live in corners, comes into being by the grace of a mere drawing. But, then, the grace of a curved line is not a simple Bergsonian movement with well placed inflexions. Nor is it merely a time that unreels. It is also habitable space harmoniously constituted.

TEXT: When we have experienced an image like the planetary image of Cyrano's apple, we understand that it was not prepared by thought. It has nothing in common with images that illustrate or sustain scientific ideas. On the other hand, the planetary image of Bohr's atom-in scientific thinking, if not in a few indigent, harmful evaluations of popular philosophy-is a pure synthetic construct of mathematical thoughts. In Bohr's planetary atom, the little central sun is not hot. This brief remark is to underline the essential difference between an absolute image that is self-accomplishing, and a post-ideated image that is content to summarize existing thoughts., LINE: 1342, BOOK: The Poetics of Space by Gaston Bachelard, KEYWORD: experienc imag like planetari imag appl understand wa prepar thought ha noth common imag illustr sustain scientif idea hand planetari imag atom scientif think indig harm evalu popular philosophi pure synthet construct mathemat thought planetari atom littl central sun hot brief remark underlin essenti differ absolut imag self post imag content summar thought
TEXT: IIIOur second example of valorized literary miniature will bea botanist's daydream. Botanists delight in the miniature of being exemplified by a flower, and they even ingenu­ ously use words that correspond to things of ordinary size to describe the intimacy of flowers. The following descri p­ tion of the flower of the German stachys may be read under Herbs in the Dictionnaire de botanique chretienne, which is a large volume of the Nouvelle Encyclopedie theologique, published in 1851: "These flowers, which are grown in cotton cradles, are pink and white in color, and small and delicate.

TEXT: VIIThe tale of Petit Poucet, transposed into' the sky, shows that images move easily from small to large and from large to small. The Gulliver type of daydream is natural, and a great dreamer sees his images doubly, on earth and in the sky. But in this poetic life of images there is more than a mere game of dimensions. Daydream is not geometrical. The dreamer commits himself absolutely. In an Appendix to C. A. Hackett's thesis on Le Lyrisme de Rimbaud, under the title, Rimbaud et Gulliver, there is an excellent passage in which Rimbaud is represented as small beside his mother, and great in the dominated world. Whereas in the presence of his mother he is nothing but "a little man in Brobdingnag's country," at school, little "Arthur imagines that he is Gulliver among the Lillipu­ tians." And C. A. Hackett quotes Victor Hugo who, in Les contemplations (Souvenirs paternels), shows children who laugh, LINE: 1449, BOOK: The Poetics of Space by Gaston Bachelard, KEYWORD: tale petit sky show imag move easili small larg larg small type daydream natur great dreamer see imag doubli earth sky poetic life imag mere game dimens daydream geometr dreamer absolut appendix thesi titl excel passag small besid mother great domin world wherea presenc mother noth littl man countri school littl imago among quot victor contempl souvenir show child laugh

Macrocosm and micro­ cosm are correlated. This correlation, which can become operative in both directions, has served as basis for certain poems by Jules Supervielle, especially those collected under the revealing tide, Gravitations. Here every poetic center of interest, whether in the sky or on the earth, is a center of active gravity. For the poet, this center of gravity is soon, if one can say this, both in heaven and on earth. For instance, with what freedom of movement in the images, the family table becomes an aerial table, with the sun for its lamp.1, LINE: 1467, BOOK: The Poetics of Space by Gaston Bachelard, KEYWORD: noel bureau main poetic impress correl familiar object come miniatur world macrocosm micro correl correl becom oper direct ha basi certain poem especi collect reveal tide gravit everi poetic center interest whether sky earth center activ graviti poet center graviti soon one say heaven earth instanc freedom movement imag famili tabl becom aerial tabl sun lamp

In reality, as we shall see later, especially when we examine images of immenseness, tiny and immense are compatible. A poet is always ready to see large and small. For instance, thanks to the image, a man like Paul Claudel, in his cosmogony was quick to assimilate the vocabulary -if not the thinking-of contemporary science. The follow­ ing lines are from his Cinq grandes odes (p.18o): "Just as we see little spiders or certain insect larvae hidden like precious stones in their cotton and satin pouches, HIn the same way, I was shown an entire nestful of still embarrassed suns in the cold folds of the nebula."

TEXT: Listen-now there's nothing-but complete silence-listen.)Here there is nothing that would require the kind of poetic imitation to be found in Victor Hugo's great play, Les Djinns. It is the silence, rather, that obliges the poet to listen, and gives the dream greater intimacy. We hardly know where to situate this silence, whether in the vast world or in the immense past. But we do know that it comes from beyond a wind that dies down or a rain that grows gentle. In another poem, (IDe. cit., p. 372) we find this unforgettable line by Milosz:, LINE: 1534, BOOK: The Poetics of Space by Gaston Bachelard, KEYWORD: listen noth complet silenc listen noth would requir kind poetic imit found victor great play silenc rather poet listen give dream greater intimaci hardli know situat silenc whether vast world immens past know come beyond wind rain gentl anoth poem ide cit find unforgett line

TEXT: XIHow hard it is to situate the values of being and non-being I And where is the root of silence? Is it a distinction of non­ being, or a domination of being? It is "deep." But where is the root of its depth? In the universe where sources about to be born are praying, or in the heart of a man who has suffered? And at what height of being should listening ears become aware? Being myself a philosopher of adjectives, I am caught up in the perplexing dialectics of deep and large; of the infinitely diminished that deepens, or the large that extends beyond all limits. In Claudel's L'annonce faite a Marie, the dialogue between Violaine and Mara reaches down to un· plumbed depths, establishing in a few words the ontological link between invisible and inaudible., LINE: 1536, BOOK: The Poetics of Space by Gaston Bachelard, KEYWORD: hard situat valu non root silenc distinct non domin deep root depth univers sourc born pray heart man ha height listen ear becom awar philosoph adject caught perplex dialect deep larg infinit larg beyond limit dialogu reach depth word ontolog link invis inaud

This frail, ephemeral thing, a voice, can bear witness to the most forceful reali­ ties.

The fact that I have made use of all the documents of fantasy and daydreams that like to play with words and the most ephemeral sort of impressions, is another admis­ sion on my part of my intention of remaining in the domain of the superficial. I have only explored the thin layer of nascent images. No doubt, the frailest, most incon­ sistent image can reveal profound vibrations. But to deter­ mine the metaphysics of all that tr�nscends our perceptive life would require a different type of research. Particularly, if we were to describe how silence affects not only man's time and speech, but also his very being, it would fill a large volume. Fortunately, this volume exists.

Daydream undoubtedly feeds on all kinds of sights, but through a sort of natural inclination, it con­ templates grandeur. And this contemplation produces an attitude that is so special, an inner state that is so unlike any other, that the daydream transports the dreamer out .. side the immediate world to a world that bears the mark of infinity. Far from the immensities of sea and land, merely through memory, we can recapture, by means of meditation, the resonances of this contemplation of grandeur.

It would be easy to furnish literary documents that would be so many variations on the theme of this limitless world, which is a primary attribute of the forest. But the following passage, marked with rare psychological depth, from Mar­ cault and Therese Brosse's excellent work,2 will help us to determine the main theme: "Forests, especially, with the mystery of their space prolonged indefinitely beyond the veil of tree-trunks and leaves, space that is veiled for our eyes, but transparent to action, are veritable psychological transcendents."s I myself should have hesitated to use the term psychological transcendents.

TEXT: 186 the poetics of spacethe transcendencies of present-day psychology. It would be difficult to express better that here the functions of de­ scription-psychological as well as objective-are ineffective. One feels that there is something else to be expressed be­ sides what is offered for objective expression. What should be expressed is hidden grandeur, depth. And so far from indulging in prolixity of expression, or losing oneself in the detail of light and shade, one feels that one is in the presence of an "essential" impression seeking expression; in short, in line with what our authors call a "psycho­ logical transcendent." If one wants to "experience the for­ est," this is an excellent way of saying that one is in the presence of immediate immensity, of the immediate im­ mensity of its depth.

TEXT: Here the poet does not describe. He knows that his is a greater task. The pious forest is shattered, closed, serried. It accumulates its infinity within its own boundaries. Far­ ther on in the poem he will speak of the symphony of an "eternal" wind that lives in the movement of the tree-tops. Thus, Pierre-Jean Jouve's "forest" is immediately sacred, sacred by virtue of the tradition of its nature, far from all history of men. Before the gods existed, the woods were sacred, and the gods came to dwell in these sacred woods. All they did was to add human, all too human, character­ istics to the great law of forest revery.

In the forest, I am my entire self. Everything is possible in my heart just as it is in the hiding places in ravines. Thickly wooded distance separates me from moral codes and cities."2 But one should read this whole prose-poem which, as the poet says, is actuated by "reverent apprehen­ sion of the Imagination of Creation."

TEXT: IVWhen a relaxed spirit meditates and dreams, immensity seems to expect images of immensity. The mind sees and continues to see objects, while the spirit finds the nest of immensity in an object. We shall have various proofs of this if we follow the daydreams that the single word vast inspired in Baudelaire. Indeed, vast is one of the most Bau­ delairian of words, the word that marks most naturally, for this poet, infinity of intimate space. No doubt, pages could be found in his work in which the, LINE: 1592, BOOK: The Poetics of Space by Gaston Bachelard, KEYWORD: relax spirit dream immens expect imag immens mind see see object spirit find nest immens object shall variou proof follow daydream singl word vast inspir inde vast one word word mark natur poet infin intim space doubt page could found work

TEXT: In the two last lines, a Mallarme-like obscurity forces the reader to stop and reflect. The poet has set him a nice problem for the imagination. The advice to "surround the tree with compulsions" would first be an obligation to draw it, to invest it with limitations in outside space. In this case, we should obey the simple rules of perception, we should be "objective," cease imagining. But the tree, like every genuine living thing, is taken in its being that "knows no bounds." Its limits are mere accidents. Against the acci­ dent of limits, the tree needs you to give it your super­ abundant images, nurtured in your intimate space, in "this space that has its being in you." Then, together, the tree and its dreamer, take their places, grow tall. Never, in the dream world, does a tree appear as a completed being. According to a poem by Jules Supervielle, it seeks its soul:1, LINE: 1670, BOOK: The Poetics of Space by Gaston Bachelard, KEYWORD: two last line like obscur forc reader stop reflect poet ha set nice problem imagin advic surround tree compuls would first oblig draw invest limit outsid space case obey simpl rule percept object ceas tree like everi genuin live thing taken know bound limit mere accid dent limit tree need give super abund imag intim space space ha togeth tree dreamer take place grow tall never dream world doe tree appear accord poem seek soul

TEXT: 201 intimate immensityBut when a poet knows that a living thing in the world is in search of its soul, this means that he is in search of his own. "A tall shuddering tree always moves the soul."! Restored to the powers of the imagination, and invested with our inner space, trees accompany us in an emulation of grandeur.

TEXT: VIIIn the realm of images, there can be no contradiction, and two spirits that are identically sensitive can sensitize the dialectics of center and horizon in different ways. In this connection a sort of plains test could be used that would bring out different types of reactions to infinity. At one end of the test, we should set what Rilke said briefly and superbly: "The plain is the sentiment that exalts us." This theorem of esthetic anthropology is so clearly stated that it suggests a correlative theorem which could be expressed in the following terms: any sentiment that exalts us makes our situation in the world smoother. Then, at the other end of the "plains" test, we could set this passage from Henri Bosco's Hyacinthe, (p. 18). "On the plains I am always elsewhere, in an elsewhere that is floating, fluid. Being for a long time absent from ·myself, and nowhere present, I am too inclined to attribute the inconsistency of my daydreams to the wide open spaces tha t induce them.", LINE: 1692, BOOK: The Poetics of Space by Gaston Bachelard, KEYWORD: realm imag contradict two spirit ident sensit sensit dialect center horizon differ way connect sort plain test could use would bring differ type reaction infin one end test set said briefli superbl plain sentiment theorem anthropolog clearli state correl theorem could express follow term sentiment make situat world smoother end plain test could set passag plain alway elsewher elsewher float fluid long time absent nowher present attribut inconsist daydream wide open space tha induc

TEXT:  Thus, in a remarkable passage, d' Annun­ ZiOl makes us see the look in the eyes of a trembling hare which, in one torment-free instant, projects peace over the entire autumnal world. He writes: "Did you ever see a hare in the morning, leave the freshly ploughed furrows, run a few seconds over the silvery frost, then stop in the silence, sit down on its hind legs, prick up its ears and look at the horizon?

It is hard to say where the two hyperboles begin; the one of the too sharp eye, and the other of the landscape that sees itself confusedly under the heavy lids of its stagnant water. But any doctrine of the imaginary is necessarily a philosophy of excess, and all images are des­ tined to be enlarged.

TEXT: }'habite la tranquillite des feuilles, l'ete grandit(I live in the tranquility of leaves, summer is growing)Tranquil foliage that really is lived in, a tranquil gaze discovered in the humblest of eyes, are the artisans of immensity. These images make the world grow, and the summer too. At certain hours poetry gives out waves of calm. From being imagined, calm becomes an emergence of being. It is like a value that dominates, in spite of minor states of being, in spite of a disturbed world. Immensity has been magnified through contemplation. And the con­ templative attitude is such a great human value that it confers immensity upon an impression that a psychologist would have every reason to declare ephemeral and special. But poems are human realities; it is not enough to resort to "impressions" in order to explain them. They must be lived in their poetic immensity., LINE: 1740, BOOK: The Poetics of Space by Gaston Bachelard, KEYWORD: de live tranquil leaf summer grow tranquil foliag realli live tranquil gaze discov eye artisan immens imag make world grow summer certain hour poetri give wave calm calm becom emerg like valu spite minor state spite disturb world immens ha contempl con attitud great human valu immens upon impress psychologist would everi reason declar ephemer special poem human realiti enough resort impress order explain must live poetic immens

The being of man is an unsettled being which all expression unsettles. In the reign of the imagination, an expression is hardly proposed� before being needs another expression, before it must be the being of another expression. In my opinion, verbal conglomerates should be avoided. There is no advantage to metaphysics for its thinking to be cast in the Inolds of linguistic fossils. On the contrary, it should benefit by the extreme mobility of modern lan­ guages and, at the same time, remain in the homogeneity of a mother tongue; which is what real poets have always done. To benefit by all the lessons of modern psychology and all that has been learned about man's being through psycho­ analysis, metaphysics should therefore be resolutely dis­ cursive.

What strikes us here is that the metaphysical aspect originates on the very level of the image, on the level of an image which disturbs the no­ tions of a spatiality commonly considered to be able to reduce these disturbances and restore the mind to a statute of indifference to space that does not have to localize dra­ matic events., LINE: 1794, BOOK: The Poetics of Space by Gaston Bachelard, KEYWORD: dialect outsid imagin must assum task seiz ephemer fact phenomenolog learn breviti imag strike metaphys aspect level imag level imag spatial commonli consid abl reduc disturb restor mind statut indiffer space doe local event
TEXT:  Personally, I welcome this poet's image as a little piece of experimental folly, like a virtual grain of hashish without which it is impossible to enter into the reign of the imagi­ nation. And how should one receive an exaggerated image, if not by exaggerating it a little more, by personalizing the exaggeration?

In fact, it is one of its primal images, the very origin of a daydream that accumulates desires and temptations: the temptation to open up the ultimate depths of being, and the desire to conquer all reticent beings. The door schematizes two strong possi­ bilities, which sharply classify two types of daydream. At times, it is closed, bolted, padlocked. At others, it is open, that is to say, wide open.

TEXT:  And secret being feels that it is guarded more by the whiteness of the lime-wash than by the strong walls. The cell of the secret is white.

TEXT:  The whiteness of the walls, alone, protects the dreamer's cell. It is stronger than all geometry. It is a part of the cell of intimacy. Such images lack stability.

TEXT:  We also risk being bored by writing that is incapable of condensing the inti­ macy of the image. And we have to withdraw deep into ourselves, for instance, to read this fragment by Maurice Blanchot in the tonality of being in which it was written: "About this room, which was plunged in utter darkness, I knew everything, I had entered into it, I bore it within me, I made it live, with a life that is not life, but which is stronger than life, and which no force in the world can., LINE: 1865, BOOK: The Poetics of Space by Gaston Bachelard, KEYWORD: also risk write incap imag withdraw deep instanc read fragment tonal wa written room wa utter dark knew everyth bore within made live life life life forc world

One feels in these repetitions, or to be more exact, in this constant strengthening of an image into which one has entered (and not of a room into which one has entered, a room which the author bears within himself, and which he has made live with a life that does not exist in life) one feels, as I said, that it is not the writer's inten­ tion merely to describe his familiar abode., LINE: 1866, BOOK: The Poetics of Space by Gaston Bachelard, KEYWORD: dialect outsid one feel repetit exact constant strengthen imag one ha room one ha room author bear within ha made live life doe exist life one feel said writer mere describ familiar abod

TEXT:  Often it is from the very fact of concentration in the most restricted intimate space that the dialectics of inside and outside draws its strength.

TEXT:  The image of being-because it is an image of being­ that appears in this fragment by Michelet is extraordinary for the very reason that it was considered of no significance.

TEXT:  Seized in its center and brevity, the mere designation of this roundness is astonishingly complete. The poets who mention it, unaware that others have done the same, reply to one another.

TEXT: To anyone who is receptive to the cosmicity of images, the essentially central image of the bird is the same in Rilke's poem as in the fragment by Michelet, only expressed in another register.

TEXT: And for a dreamer of words, what calm there is in the word round. How peacefully it makes one's mouth, lips and the being of breath become round. Because this too should be spoken by a philosopher who believes in the poetic substance of speech. And for the professor who has broken with every kind of "being-there" (etre-la), it is a joy to the ear to begin his course in metaphysics with the declaration: Das Dasein ist rund. Being is round. Then wait for the rumblings of this dogmatic thunder to die down, while his disciples beam with ecstasy. But let us come back to a simpler, more tangible kind of roundness., LINE: 1941, BOOK: The Poetics of Space by Gaston Bachelard, KEYWORD: dreamer word calm word round peac make one mouth lip breath becom round spoken philosoph belief poetic substanc speech professor ha broken everi kind joy ear begin cours metaphys declar da ist round wait rumbl dogmat thunder die discipl beam ecstasi let come back simpler tangibl kind round
TEXT: vSometimes we find ourselves in the presence of a form. that guides and encloses our earliest dreams. For a painter, a tree is composed in its roundness. But a poet continues the dream from higher up. He knows that when a thing becomes isolated, it becomes round, assumes a figure of being that is concentrated upon itself. In Rilke's Poemes francais� this is how the walnut tree lives and commands attention. Here, again around a lone tree, which is the center of a world, the dome of the sky becomes round, in accordance with the rule of cosmic poetry. On p. 169 of this collection we read:, LINE: 1942, BOOK: The Poetics of Space by Gaston Bachelard, KEYWORD: find presenc form guid dream painter tree compos round poet dream higher know thing becom isol becom round figur concentr upon walnut tree life command attent around lone tree center world dome sky becom round accord rule cosmic poetri collect read

TEXT: Needless to say, all the poet really sees is a tree in a meadow; he is not thinking of a legendary Yggdrasill that would concentrate the entire cosmos, uniting heaven and earth, within itself. But the imagination of round being follows its own law: since, as the poet says, the walnut tree is "proudly rounded," it can feast upon "heaven's great dome." The world is round around the round being. And from verse to verse, the poem grows, increases its being. The tree is alive, reflective, straining toward God., LINE: 1944, BOOK: The Poetics of Space by Gaston Bachelard, KEYWORD: needless say poet realli see tree meadow think legendari would concentr entir cosmo unit heaven earth within imagin round law sinc poet say walnut tree proudli round feast upon heaven great dome world round around round vers vers poem increas tree aliv reflect strain toward god

TEXT: I shall never find a better document for a phenomenology of a being which is at once established in its roundness and developing in it.
