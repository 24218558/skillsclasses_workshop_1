TEXT:  Such austerity has been a historical constant. In the spring of 1137 the Cistercian monk St Bernard of Clairvaux travelled all the way around Lake Geneva without noticing it was even there.

TEXT:  An ugly room can coagulate any loose suspicions as to the incompleteness of life, while a sun-lit one set with honey-coloured limestone tiles can lend support to whatever is most hopeful within us.

TEXT:  We accept with gratitude the power that a single room can possess. But sensitivity to architecture also has its more problematic aspects. If one room can alter how we feel, if our happiness can hang on the colour of the walls or the shape of a door, what will happen to us in most of the places we are forced to look at and inhabit? What will we experience in a house with prison-like windows, stained carpet tiles and plastic curtains? It is to prevent the possibility of permanent anguish that we can be led to shut our eyes to most of what is around us, for we are never far from damp stains and cracked ceilings, shattered cities and rusting dockyards., LINE: 37, BOOK: The Architecture of Happiness by Alain de Botton, KEYWORD: accept gratitud power singl room possess sensit architectur also ha problemat aspect one room alter feel happi colour wall shape door happen place forc look inhabit experi hous prison like window carpet tile plastic curtain prevent possibl perman anguish led shut eye around never far damp stain crack ceil citi dockyard
TEXT:  We can’t remain sensitive indefinitely to environments which we don’t have the means to alter for the good – and end up as conscious as we can afford to be. Echoing the attitude of Stoic philosophers or St Bernard around Lake Geneva, we may find ourselves arguing that, ultimately, it doesn’t much matter what buildings look like, what is on the ceiling or how the wall is treated – professions of detachment that stem not so much from an insensitivity to beauty as from a desire to deflect the sadness we would face if we left ourselves open to all of beauty’s many absences., LINE: 38, BOOK: The Architecture of Happiness by Alain de Botton, KEYWORD: remain sensit indefinit environ mean alter good end consciou afford attitud stoic philosoph around lake geneva may find ultim much matter build look like ceil wall profess detach stem much insensit beauti desir deflect sad would face left open beauti mani absenc

TEXT:  It is only when we try our own hand at construction that we are initiated into the torments associated with persuading materials and other humans to cooperate with our designs, with ensuring that two pieces of glass will be joined in a neat line, that a lamp will hang symmetrically over the stairs, that a boiler will light up when it should or that concrete pillars will marry a roof without complaint., LINE: 42, BOOK: The Architecture of Happiness by Alain de Botton, KEYWORD: tri hand construct torment associ materi human design two piec glass neat line lamp symmetr stair boiler light concret pillar marri roof without complaint
TEXT:  Even when we have attained our goals, our buildings have a grievous tendency to fall apart again with precipitate speed.

TEXT:  The ruins of the Ancient World offer a mocking lesson for anyone waiting for builders to finish their work. How proud the householders of Pompeii must have been.

TEXT:  It wasn’t that Rilke was oblivious to the beauty around him; he simply could not overlook how impermanent everything was.

TEXT:  Freud was unsympathetic; for him, the capacity to love anything attractive, however fragile it might be, was a hallmark of psychological health.

TEXT:  It would be pleasant to refuse in a muscular spirit to lend stray blemishes genuine significance. However, aesthetes force us to consider whether happiness may not sometimes turn on the presence or absence of a fingerprint, whether in certain situations beauty and ugliness may not lie only a few millimetres apart, whether a single mark might not wreck a wall or an errant brush stroke undo a landscape painting., LINE: 52, BOOK: The Architecture of Happiness by Alain de Botton, KEYWORD: would pleasant refus muscular spirit lend stray blemish genuin signific howev aesthet forc consid whether happi may sometim turn presenc absenc fingerprint whether certain situat beauti ugli may lie apart whether singl mark might wreck wall errant brush stroke undo landscap paint

TEXT:  The noblest architecture can sometimes do less for us than a siesta or an aspirin. Those who have made architectural beauty their life’s work know only too well how futile their efforts can prove.

It seems reasonable to suppose that people will possess some of the qualities of the buildings they are drawn to: to expect that if they are alive to the charm of an ancient farmhouse with walls made of irregular chiselled stones set in light mortar, if they can appreciate the play of candlelight against hand-decorated tiles, can be seduced by libraries with shelves filled from floor to ceiling with books that emit a sweet dusty smell and are content to lie on the floor tracing the knotted border of an intricate Turkoman rug, then they will know something about patience and stability, tenderness and sweetness, intelligence and worldliness, scepticism and trust., LINE: 65, BOOK: The Architecture of Happiness by Alain de Botton, KEYWORD: beauti hous falter guarantor happi also accus fail improv charact live reason suppos peopl possess qualiti build drawn expect aliv charm ancient farmhous wall made irregular stone set light mortar appreci play candlelight hand decor tile librari shelf fill floor ceil book emit sweet dusti smell content lie floor trace knot border intric rug know someth patienc stabil tender sweet intellig worldli trust

But, whatever the theoretical affinities between beauty and goodness, it is undeniable that, in practice, farmhouses and lodges, mansions and riverside apartments have played host to innumerous tyrants and murderers, sadists and snobs, to characters with a chilling indifference to the disjunctures between the qualities manifested in their surroundings and in their lives., LINE: 66, BOOK: The Architecture of Happiness by Alain de Botton, KEYWORD: expect enthusiast whole life valu object appreci whatev theoret affin beauti good undeni practic farmhous lodg mansion riversid apart host innumer tyrant murder sadist snob charact chill indiffer disjunctur qualiti manifest surround life

TEXT: We would still often be in a bad mood: Philip Johnson, The Glass House, New Canaan, Connecticut, 1949Medieval devotional paintings may try to remind us of sadness and sin, they may seek to train us away from arrogance and worldly pursuits and render us properly humble before the mysteries and hardships of life, but they will hang in a living room without active protest while butlers circulate the finger food and butchers plot their next move. Architecture may well possess moral messages; it simply has no power to enforce them. It offers suggestions instead of making laws. It invites, rather than orders, us to emulate its spirit and cannot prevent its own abuse.

TEXT:  To care deeply about a field that achieves so little, and yet consumes so many of our resources, forces us to admit to a disturbing, even degrading lack of aspiration.

More awkwardly still, architecture asks us to imagine that happiness might often have an unostentatious, unheroic character to it, that it might be found in a run of old floorboards or in a wash of morning light over a plaster wall – in undramatic, frangible scenes of beauty that move us because we are aware of the darker backdrop against which they are set., LINE: 84, BOOK: The Architecture of Happiness by Alain de Botton, KEYWORD: architectur even accomplish ever constitut small imperfect expens prone destruct moral unreli protest state thing awkwardli still architectur imagin happi might often unostentati unhero charact might found run old wash morn light plaster wall undramat frangibl scene beauti move awar backdrop set

Ludwig Wittgenstein, having abandoned academia for three years in order to construct a house for his sister Gretl in Vienna, understood the magnitude of the challenge. ‘You think philosophy is difficult,’ observed the author of the Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus, ‘but I tell you, it is nothing compared to the difficulty of being a good architect.’, LINE: 86, BOOK: The Architecture of Happiness by Alain de Botton, KEYWORD: accept legitimaci subject nevertheless new contenti seri question open confront vex point much histori architectur pivot ask exactli beauti build might look like abandon three year order construct hous sister understood magnitud challeng think philosophi difficult author tell noth difficulti good architect
TEXT: II. In What Style Shall We Build?1.What is a beautiful building? To be modern is to experience this as an awkward and possibly unanswerable question, the very notion of beauty having come to seem like a concept doomed to ignite unfruitful and childish argument. How can anyone claim to know what is attractive? How can anyone adjudicate between the competing claims of different styles or defend a particular choice in the face of the contradictory tastes of others? The creation of beauty, once viewed as the central task of the architect, has quietly evaporated from serious professional discussion and retreated to a confused private imperative., LINE: 87, BOOK: The Architecture of Happiness by Alain de Botton, KEYWORD: style shall build beauti build modern experi awkward possibl unanswer question notion beauti come seem like concept ignit unfruit childish argument anyon claim know attract anyon adjud claim differ style defend particular choic face contradictori tast creation beauti central task architect ha quietli seriou profession discuss confus privat imper

Every architect has a theory of his own.’ In 1828 a young German practitioner named Heinrich Hübsch published a book whose title characterised the dilemma of an entire age: In What Style Shall We Build? There had to be a way for the defenders of the Gothic, Old English and Swiss styles to resolve their disputes; there had to be a way of knowing whether to furnish the dining room with Ancient Egyptian or Chinese chairs; a way of giving the upper hand to either Lady Anne or Viscount Bangor – and thus of ensuring that houses would never again be built facing in two different directions.

TEXT:  Charged with erecting a bridge, they tried to design the lightest possible frame that could stretch over the widest span at the lowest cost.

TEXT:  ‘Architecture, as distinguished from mere building, is the decoration of construction,’ echoed Sir George Gilbert Scott. If the Doge’s Palace deserved to be classified as great architecture, it was not because the roof was watertight or because it provided Venice’s civil servants with the necessary number of meeting rooms but rather, the architects defensively suggested, because it sported carvings on its roof, a delicate arrangement of white and pink bricks on its façades, and deliberately slender, tapering, pointed arches throughout – details that would have had no place in a design by a graduate of the École Polytechnique in Paris or the Engineering Academy of Dresden., LINE: 144, BOOK: The Architecture of Happiness by Alain de Botton, KEYWORD: architectur distinguish mere build decor construct sir gilbert doge palac deserv classifi great architectur wa roof wa watertight provid civil servant necessari number meet room rather architect defens carv roof delic arrang white pink brick facad deliber slender taper point arch throughout detail would place design graduat ecol engin academi

TEXT:  The engineers had landed on an apparently impregnable method of evaluating the wisdom of a design: they felt confidently able to declare that a structure was correct and honest in so far as it performed its mechanical functions efficiently; and false and immoral in so far as it was burdened with non-supporting pillars, decorative statues, frescos or carvings., LINE: 148, BOOK: The Architecture of Happiness by Alain de Botton, KEYWORD: engin land appar impregn method wisdom design felt confid abl declar structur wa correct honest far mechan function effici fals immor far wa non support pillar decor statu fresco carv
TEXT:  Exchanging discussions of beauty for considerations of function promised to move architecture away from a morass of perplexing, insoluble disputes about aesthetics towards an uncontentious pursuit of technological truth, ensuring that it might henceforth be as peculiar to argue about the appearance of a building as it would be to argue about the answer to a simple algebraic equation., LINE: 149, BOOK: The Architecture of Happiness by Alain de Botton, KEYWORD: discuss beauti consider function move architectur away morass perplex insolubl disput aesthet toward uncontenti pursuit technolog truth might henceforth peculiar argu appear build would argu answer simpl algebra equat

He even mocked Rome, the traditional destination for the education and edification of young architects, and renamed it the ‘city of horrors’, ‘the damnation of the half-educated’ and ‘the cancer of French architecture’ – on account of its violation of functional principles through an abundance of Baroque detailing, wall-painting and statuary., LINE: 160, BOOK: The Architecture of Happiness by Alain de Botton, KEYWORD: push monstros cliff dover instead learn travel around realm race car even tradit destin educ edif young architect citi horror damnat half educ cancer architectur account violat function principl abund baroqu wall paint statuari

TEXT:  It was to these machines that his books accorded the reverential photographs which previous architectural writers had reserved for cathedrals and opera houses. Once asked by a magazine editor to name his favourite chair, Le Corbusier cited the seat of a cockpit, and described the first time he ever saw an aeroplane, in the spring of 1909, in the sky above Paris – it was the aviator the Comte de Lambert taking a turn around the Eiffel Tower – as the most significant moment of his life., LINE: 163, BOOK: The Architecture of Happiness by Alain de Botton, KEYWORD: wa machin book reverenti photograph previou architectur writer reserv cathedr opera hous magazin editor name chair seat cockpit first time ever saw aeroplan spring sky wa aviat lambert take turn around tower signific moment life
TEXT:  He observed that the requirements of flight of necessity rid aeroplanes of all superfluous decoration and so unwittingly transformed them into successful pieces of architecture. To place a Classical statue atop a house was as absurd as to add one to a plane, he noted, but at least by crashing in response to this addition, the plane had the advantage of rendering its absurdity starkly manifest., LINE: 164, BOOK: The Architecture of Happiness by Alain de Botton, KEYWORD: requir flight necess rid aeroplan superflu decor unwittingli success piec architectur place classic statu atop hous wa absurd add one plane note least respons addit plane advantag render absurd starkli manifest

Le Corbusier arrived (‘scientifically’ he assured his readers) at a simple list of requirements, beyond which all other ambitions were no more than ‘romantic cobwebs’. The function of a house was, he wrote, to provide: ‘1. A shelter against heat, cold, rain, thieves and the inquisitive. 2. A receptacle for light and sun. 3.

We return to the carnival of architecture. Why not carve flowers on our buildings? Why not use concrete panels imprinted with pictures of aeroplanes and insects? Why not coat a skyscraper with Islamic motifs? If engineering cannot tell us what our houses should look like, nor in a pluralistic and non-deferential world can precedent or tradition, we must be free to pursue all stylistic options.

TEXT: 18.However, there might be a way to surmount this state of sterile relativism with the help of John Ruskin’s provocative remark about the eloquence of architecture. The remark focuses our minds on the idea that buildings are not simply visual objects without any connection to concepts which we can analyse and then evaluate. Buildings speak – and on topics which can readily be discerned. They speak of democracy or aristocracy, openness or arrogance, welcome or threat, a sympathy for the future or a hankering for the past., LINE: 211, BOOK: The Architecture of Happiness by Alain de Botton, KEYWORD: howev might way surmount state steril relativ help ruskin provoc remark eloqu architectur remark focu mind idea build simpli visual object without connect concept analys evalu build speak topic readili speak democraci aristocraci open arrog welcom threat sympathi futur hanker past

Arguments about what is beautiful emerge as no easier to resolve, but then again no harder, than disputes about what is wise or right. We can learn to defend or attack a concept of beauty in the same way we might defend or attack a legal position or an ethical stance. We can understand, and publically explain, why we believe a building to be desirable or offensive on the basis of the things it talks to us about. The notion of buildings that speak helps us to place at the very centre of our architectural conundrums the question of the values we want to live by – rather than merely of how we want things to look., LINE: 218, BOOK: The Architecture of Happiness by Alain de Botton, KEYWORD: advantag shift focu discuss away strictli visual toward valu build becom abl handl talk appear work architectur rather debat peopl idea polit agenda argument beauti emerg easier resolv harder disput wise right learn defend attack concept beauti way might defend attack legal posit ethic stanc understand explain believ build desir offens basi thing talk notion build speak help place architectur conundrum question valu want live rather mere want thing look

Talking Buildings1.If our interest in buildings and objects is indeed determined as much by what they say to us as by how they perform their material functions, it is worth elaborating on the curious process by which arrangements of stone, steel, concrete, wood and glass seem able to express themselves – and can on rare occasions leave us under the impression that they are talking to us about significant and touching things., LINE: 219, BOOK: The Architecture of Happiness by Alain de Botton, KEYWORD: want build talk left home place right offic villa talk build interest build object inde determin much say perform materi function worth curiou process arrang stone steel concret wood glass seem abl express rare occas leav impress talk signific touch thing
TEXT: 2.We will, of course, run a risk if we spend extended periods analysing the meanings that emanate from practical objects. To be preoccupied with deciphering the message encoded in a light switch or a tap is to leave ourselves more than usually vulnerable to the commonsensical scorn of those who seek little from such fittings beyond a means of illuminating their bedroom or rinsing their teeth. To inoculate ourselves against this derision, and to gain confidence in cultivating a contrary, more meditative attitude towards objects, we might profitably pay a visit to a museum of modern art. In whitewashed galleries housing collections of twentieth-century abstract sculpture, we are offered a rare perspective on how exactly three-dimensional masses can assume and convey meaning – a perspective that may in turn enable us to regard our fittings and houses in a new way., LINE: 220, BOOK: The Architecture of Happiness by Alain de Botton, KEYWORD: cours run risk spend extend period mean eman practic object preoccupi messag light switch tap leav usual vulner commonsens scorn seek littl fit beyond mean illumin bedroom rins teeth inocul deris gain confid contrari medit attitud toward object might profit pay visit museum modern art galleri hous collect twentieth centuri abstract sculptur rare perspect exactli three dimension mass assum convey mean perspect may turn enabl regard fit hous new way

Voysey, Moorcrag, Cumbria, 1899Stallarholmen, near Mariefred, Sweden, c. 1850Walking past the Carlton Cinema on London’s Essex Road, we may remark something oddly Egyptian about the windows. This stylistic term will occur to us because at some point in our past – perhaps on an evening when we watched a documentary about Ancient Egypt while eating dinner – our eyes took note of the angles of the pylon gateways to the temples at Karnak, Luxor and Philae. That we can now retrieve that half-forgotten detail and apply it to the narrowing of a city window is testament to the synaptic process by which our subconscious can master information and make connections that our conscious selves may be wholly incapable of articulating., LINE: 272, BOOK: The Architecture of Happiness by Alain de Botton, KEYWORD: near walk past cinema road may remark someth oddli window stylist term occur point past perhap even watch documentari ancient eat dinner eye took note angl pylon gateway templ retriev half forgotten detail appli citi window testament synapt process subconsci master inform make connect consciou self may wholli incap
TEXT: Temple of Isis, Philae, c. 140 BCGeorge Cole, Carlton Cinema, Essex Road, London, 1930Relying on our associative powers, architects can dimple their arches and windows and feel confident that they will be understood as references to Islam. They can line their corridors with unpainted wooden planks and dependably allude to the rustic and the unpretentious. They can install thick white railings around balconies and know that their seaside villas will speak of ocean liners and the nautical life. A more disturbing aspect of associations lies in their arbitrary nature, in the way they can lead us to pass a verdict on objects or buildings for reasons unconnected to their specifically architectural virtues or vices. We may make a judgement based on what they symbolise rather than on what they are., LINE: 273, BOOK: The Architecture of Happiness by Alain de Botton, KEYWORD: templ cole cinema road associ power architect dimpl arch window feel confid understood refer line corridor unpaint wooden plank depend allud rustic unpretenti instal thick white rail around balconi know seasid villa speak ocean liner nautic life disturb aspect associ lie arbitrari natur way lead verdict object build reason unconnect specif architectur virtu vice may make base rather

Ideals of HomeMemory1.If it is true that the buildings and furnishings which we describe as beautiful evoke aspects of happiness, we might nevertheless ask why we find such evocation to be necessary. It is easy enough to understand why we would want such qualities as dignity and clarity to play a role in our lives; less clear is why we should also need the objects around us to speak to us of them. Why should it matter what our environment has to say to us? Why should architects bother to design buildings which communicate specific sentiments and ideas, and why should we be so negatively affected by places which reverberate with what we take to be the wrong allusions? Why are we vulnerable, so inconveniently vulnerable, to what the spaces we inhabit are saying?, LINE: 296, BOOK: The Architecture of Happiness by Alain de Botton, KEYWORD: everi architectur style understand happi hous new forest ideal true build furnish describ beauti evok aspect happi might nevertheless ask find evoc necessari easi enough understand would want qualiti digniti clariti play role life less clear also need object around speak matter environ ha say architect bother design build commun specif sentiment idea neg affect place reverber take wrong allus vulner inconveni vulner space inhabit say
TEXT: 2.Our sensitivity to our surroundings may be traced back to a troubling feature of human psychology: to the way we harbour within us many different selves, not all of which feel equally like ‘us’, so much so that in certain moods, we can complain of having come adrift from what we judge to be our true selves., LINE: 297, BOOK: The Architecture of Happiness by Alain de Botton, KEYWORD: sensit surround may back troubl featur human psycholog way harbour within mani differ self feel equal like much certain mood complain come adrift judg true self

TEXT: by looking than by reading They argued that mankind could more effectively be shaped by architecture than by Scripture. Because we were creatures of sense, spiritual principles stood a better chance of fortifying our souls if we took them in via our eyes rather than via our intellect. We might learn more about humility by gazing at an arrangement of tiles than by studying the Gospels, and more about the nature of kindness in a stained-glass window than in a holy book. Spending time in beautiful spaces, far from a self-indulgent luxury, was deemed to lie at the core of the quest to become an honorable person., LINE: 353, BOOK: The Architecture of Happiness by Alain de Botton, KEYWORD: look read mankind could effect shape architectur scriptur creatur sens spiritu principl stood better chanc fortifi soul took via eye rather via intellect might learn humil gaze arrang tile gospel natur kind glass window holi book spend time beauti space far self indulg luxuri wa lie core quest becom honor person

But only if the truest parts of ourselves were egomaniacal would the urge to build be dominated by the need to boast. Instead, at its most genuine, the architectural impulse seems connected to a longing for communication and commemoration, a longing to declare ourselves to the world through a register other than words, through the language of objects, colours and bricks: an ambition to let others know who we are – and, in the process, to remind ourselves., LINE: 379, BOOK: The Architecture of Happiness by Alain de Botton, KEYWORD: may occasion guiltili experi desir creat home wish vaunt front part egomaniac would urg build domin need boast instead genuin architectur impuls connect long commun commemor long declar world regist word languag object colour brick ambit let know process remind

Stepping out onto the terrace for a breath of air after reading a few chapters of Seneca or reviewing a contract from the Levant, the villa’s owner could raise his eyes to take in Mercury, the protector of commerce, Jupiter, the god of wisdom, or Vesta, the goddess of the hearth – and feel that, in his country dwelling, at least, the values closest to his heart had found lasting expression and glorification in stone., LINE: 389, BOOK: The Architecture of Happiness by Alain de Botton, KEYWORD: along villa pediment stairway sequenc life size statu sculptor gave human form figur classic mytholog step onto terrac breath air read chapter contract levant villa owner could rais eye take protector commerc god wisdom goddess hearth feel countri dwell least valu heart found last express glorif stone

In his On the Aesthetic Education of Man (1794), Friedrich Schiller proposed that the perfections presented in idealised art could be sources of inspiration, to which we would be able to turn when we had lost confidence in ourselves and were in contact only with our flaws, a melancholic and self-destructive stance to which he felt his own age especially prone., LINE: 415, BOOK: The Architecture of Happiness by Alain de Botton, KEYWORD: german philosophi late eighteenth centuri find lucid articul theori artist aesthet educ man schiller perfect art could sourc inspir would abl turn lost confid contact flaw melanchol self destruct stanc felt age especi prone

TEXT:  Architecture excites our respect to the extent that it surpasses us. The potential inscribed in an idealised building need never fully be realised to justify its worth. In the eyes of Schiller’s contemporary Wilhelm von Humboldt, it was the idealised buildings of the Ancient Greeks that presented modern Westerners with the most nourishing sources of inspiration, though he added in his essay ‘Concerning the Study of Antiquity’ (1793) that Greek architecture deserved our interest even if only a semblance of the perfections it alluded to could ever be re-created in the practically minded, bourgeois world: ‘We imitate the models of the Greeks in full consciousness that they are unattainable; we fill our imagination with the images of their free, richly gained life, knowing that such life is denied us., LINE: 419, BOOK: The Architecture of Happiness by Alain de Botton, KEYWORD: architectur respect extent potenti build need never fulli justifi worth eye schiller contemporari wa build ancient modern western nourish sourc inspir though ad essay concern studi antiqu architectur deserv interest even semblanc perfect could ever practic mind bourgeoi world imit model full conscious unattain fill imagin imag free richli life know life

With its proud isolation, its juxtapositioning of ruggedness and refinement, its unblinking, hardy defiance of the elements, and the aesthetic debt it owed to Ancient Rome on the one hand and Italian modernism on the other, the house did indeed pick up on key traits of Malaparte’s character. Fortunately for visitors, however, it turned out not to be a slavishly faithful portrait of its owner in all his facets – a difficult prospect for any house, certainly, but particularly so in Malaparte’s case, for that would have necessitated the inclusion of pretentious furnishings, dead-end corridors, perhaps a shooting range (he was a Fascist until 1943) and a few broken windows (he liked a drink and then a fight). Rather than reflecting the author’s many foibles, Casa Malaparte, like all effective works of idealisation, assisted its gifted yet flawed proprietor in orienting himself towards the noblest sides of his personality., LINE: 437, BOOK: The Architecture of Happiness by Alain de Botton, KEYWORD: come isol rugged refin unblink hardi defianc element aesthet debt ancient one hand modern hous inde pick key trait charact fortun visitor howev turn slavishli faith portrait owner facet difficult prospect hous certainli particularli case would inclus pretenti furnish dead end corridor perhap shoot rang wa fascist broken window drink fight rather reflect author mani foibl like effect work gift yet flaw proprietor toward side person
TEXT: 5.The architecture produced under the influence of an idealising theory of the arts might be described as a form of propaganda. The word is an alarming one, for we are inclined to believe that high art should be free of ideology and admired purely for its own sake. Yet the term ‘propaganda’ refers to the promotion of any doctrine or set of beliefs and in and of itself should carry no negative connotations. That the majority of such promotion has been in the service of odious political and commercial agendas is more an accident of history than any fault of the word. A work of art becomes a piece of propaganda whenever it uses its resources to direct us towards something, insofar as it attempts to enhance our sensitivity and our readiness to respond favourably to any end or idea., LINE: 438, BOOK: The Architecture of Happiness by Alain de Botton, KEYWORD: architectur produc influenc theori art might form propaganda word alarm one believ high art free ideolog admir pure sake yet term propaganda promot doctrin set belief carri neg connot major promot ha servic odiou polit commerci agenda accid histori fault word work art becom piec propaganda whenev us resourc direct toward someth insofar attempt enhanc sensit readi respond end idea

TEXT: of the California desert. Taking the apparently perverse step of giving each of these the same label merely serves to stress the directive aspect of all consciously created objects – objects which invite viewers to imitate and participate in the qualities encoded within them. From this perspective, we would be wise not to pursue the impossible goal of extirpating propaganda altogether, but should instead endeavour to surround ourselves with its more honourable examples. There is nothing to lament in the idea that art can direct our actions, provided that the directions it points us in are valuable ones. The theorists of the idealising tradition were refreshingly frank in their insistence that art should try to make things happen – and, more importantly, that it should try to make us good., LINE: 440, BOOK: The Architecture of Happiness by Alain de Botton, KEYWORD: desert take appar pervers step give label mere serf stress direct aspect conscious object object invit viewer imit particip qualiti within perspect would wise pursu imposs goal propaganda altogeth instead surround exampl noth lament idea art direct action provid direct point valuabl one theorist tradit refreshingli frank insist art tri make thing happen importantli tri make good
TEXT: John Wood the Younger, Royal Crescent, Bath, 17756.A perplexing consequence of fixing our eyes on an ideal is that it may make us sad. The more beautiful something is, the sadder we risk feeling, so that standing in front of a painting by Pieter de Hooch of a grave-faced little boy diligently bringing his mother some loaves of bread, or of John Wood the Younger’s Royal Crescent in Bath, we may find ourselves not so far from tears. Our sadness won’t be of the searing kind but more like a blend of joy and melancholy: joy at the perfection we see before us, melancholy at an awareness of how seldom we are sufficiently blessed to encounter anything of its kind. The flawless object throws into perspective the mediocrity that surrounds it. We are reminded of the way we would wish things always to be and of how incomplete our lives remain., LINE: 441, BOOK: The Architecture of Happiness by Alain de Botton, KEYWORD: wood younger royal crescent bath perplex consequ fix eye ideal may make sad beauti someth risk feel stand front paint hooch grave face littl boy dilig mother loaf bread wood younger royal crescent bath may find far tear sad sear kind like blend joy melancholi joy perfect see melancholi awar seldom suffici bless encount anyth kind flawless object throw perspect mediocr surround way would wish thing alway incomplet life remain
TEXT: Pieter de Hooch, A Boy Bringing Bread, c. 1665Pieter de Hooch’s figures and the curve of the Royal Crescent stir us through the contrast they present to the emotions which more usually colour our days. The gentle manner of the mother and the trusting, dutiful expression of her son make us conscious of our own cynicism and brusqueness. The Royal Crescent, in all its solemn dignity, shows up the trivial and chaotic nature of so many of our ambitions. These works of art touch us because they are unlike us and yet also like the way we might wish ourselves to be. Christian philosophers have been singularly alive to the sadness which beauty may provoke. ‘When we admire the beauty of visible objects, we experience joy certainly,’ observed the medieval thinker Hugh of St Victor, ‘but at the same time, we experience a feeling of tremendous void.’ The religious explanation put, LINE: 442, BOOK: The Architecture of Happiness by Alain de Botton, KEYWORD: hooch boy bread hooch figur curv royal crescent stir contrast present emot usual colour day gentl manner mother trust duti express son make consciou cynic brusqu royal crescent solemn digniti show trivial chaotic natur mani ambit work art touch unlik yet also like way might wish philosoph singularli aliv sad beauti may provok admir beauti visibl object experi joy certainli mediev thinker victor time experi feel tremend void religi explan put

TEXT: Knowing that what we now love may in the future, for reasons beyond our current understanding, appear absurd is as hard to bear in the context of a piece of furniture in a shop as it is in the context of a prospective spouse at an altar.

TEXT: 2.Why do we change our minds about what we find beautiful? In 1907 a young German art historian named Wilhelm Worringer published an essay entitled ‘Abstraction and Empathy’, in which he attempted to explain our shifts from a psychological perspective., LINE: 467, BOOK: The Architecture of Happiness by Alain de Botton, KEYWORD: chang mind find beauti young german art historian essay abstract empathi explain shift psycholog perspect

TEXT:  This was an art governed by a spirit of symmetry, order, regularity and geometry. Whether in the form of sculpture or carpets, mosaics or pottery, whether in the work of a basket weaver from Wewak or that of a painter from New York, abstract art aspired to create a tranquil atmosphere marked by flat, repetitive visual planes, the whole being free of any allusion to the living world., LINE: 470, BOOK: The Architecture of Happiness by Alain de Botton, KEYWORD: wa art spirit symmetri order regular geometri whether form sculptur carpet mosaic potteri whether work basket weaver painter new york abstract art creat tranquil atmospher mark flat repetit visual plane whole free allus live world

TEXT:  Artists of this stripe strove to capture the atmosphere of a threatening pine forest, the texture of human blood, the swelling of a teardrop or the ferocity of a lion. The most compelling aspect of Worringer’s theory – a point as readily applicable to architecture as it is to painting – was his explanation of why a society might transfer its loyalty from the one aesthetic mode to the other., LINE: 472, BOOK: The Architecture of Happiness by Alain de Botton, KEYWORD: artist stripe strove captur atmospher threaten pine forest textur human blood swell teardrop feroc lion compel aspect theori point readili applic architectur paint wa explan societi might transfer loyalti one aesthet mode
TEXT:  The determinant lay, he believed, in those values which the society in question was lacking, for it would love in art whatever it did not possess in sufficient supply within itself. Abstract art, infused as it was with harmony, stillness and rhythm, would appeal chiefly to societies yearning for calm – societies in which law and order were fraying, ideologies were shifting, and a sense of physical danger was compounded by moral and spiritual confusion., LINE: 473, BOOK: The Architecture of Happiness by Alain de Botton, KEYWORD: determin lay valu societi question wa would love art whatev possess suffici suppli within abstract art wa harmoni still rhythm would appeal chiefli societi yearn calm societi law order fray ideolog shift sens physic danger wa moral spiritu confus
TEXT:  Against such a turbulent background (the sort of atmosphere to be found in many of the metropolises of twentieth-century America or in New Guinean villages enervated by generations of internecine strife), inhabitants would experience what Worringer termed ‘an immense need for tranquillity’, and so would turn to the abstract, to patterned baskets or the minimalist galleries of Lower Manhattan., LINE: 474, BOOK: The Architecture of Happiness by Alain de Botton, KEYWORD: turbul background sort atmospher found mani metropoli twentieth centuri new villag gener internecin strife inhabit would experi immens need tranquil would turn abstract pattern basket galleri lower

TEXT:  We respect a style which can move us away from what we fear and towards what we crave: a style which carries the correct dosage of our missing virtues.

We can understand a seventeenth-century elite’s taste for gilded walls by simultaneously remembering the context in which this form of decoration developed its appeal: one where violence and disease were constant threats, even for the wealthy – fertile soil from which to begin appreciating the corrective promises offered by angels holding aloft garlands of flowers and ribbons., LINE: 485, BOOK: The Architecture of Happiness by Alain de Botton, KEYWORD: light given stylist choic tell much advoc lack like understand seventeenth centuri elit tast gild wall simultan context form decor appeal one violenc diseas constant threat even wealthi fertil soil begin correct promis angel hold aloft garland flower ribbon

TEXT:  An absence of politesse is no longer the prevailing dread. In most Western cities, at least, the worst of the slums have been replaced by clean, well-charted streets. Life in much of the developed world has become rule-bound and materially abundant, punctilious and routine, to the extent that longings now run in another direction: towards the natural and unfussy, the rough and authentic – longings that bourgeois households may rely on unrendered walls and breeze blocks to help them to assuage., LINE: 487, BOOK: The Architecture of Happiness by Alain de Botton, KEYWORD: absenc politess longer dread western citi least worst slum clean well street life much world ha becom rule bound materi abund punctili routin extent long run anoth direct toward natur unfussi rough authent long bourgeoi household may reli unrend wall breez block help assuag

TEXT:  ‘Since the Greeks had not lost nature in themselves,’ he explained, ‘they had no great desire to create objects external to them in which they could recover it.’ And then, turning to his own day, Schiller drove home his message: ‘However, as nature begins gradually to vanish from human life as a direct experience, so we see it emerge in the world of the poet as an idea., LINE: 493, BOOK: The Architecture of Happiness by Alain de Botton, KEYWORD: sinc lost natur great desir creat object extern could recov turn day schiller drove home messag howev natur begin gradual vanish human life direct experi see emerg world poet idea

TEXT: 8.The clashes and evolutions in our sense of what is beautiful may be painful and costly, but there seems little chance of insulating ourselves from them entirely: of producing chairs or sideboards, for instance, which could be guaranteed to provoke a unanimous or permanent aura of charm. Clashes of taste are an inevitable by-product of a world where forces continually fragment and deplete us in new ways. As long as societies and individuals have a history, that is, a record of changing struggles and ambitions, then art, too, will have a history – within which there will always be casualties in the form of unloved sofas, houses and monuments. As the ways in which we are unbalanced alters, so our attention will continue to be drawn to new parts of the spectrum of taste, to new styles which we will declare beautiful on the basis that they embody in a concentrated form what now lies in shadow within us., LINE: 523, BOOK: The Architecture of Happiness by Alain de Botton, KEYWORD: clash evolut sens beauti may pain costli littl chanc insul entir chair sideboard instanc could provok unanim perman aura charm clash tast inevit product world forc continu fragment deplet new way long societi individu histori record struggl ambit art histori within alway casualti form unlov sofa hous monument way unbalanc attent continu drawn new part spectrum tast new style declar beauti basi embodi concentr form lie shadow within

TEXT: 3.Yet, despite the confidence of such assertions, Palladio’s laws were not to prove as enduring as the reputations of his houses. What discredited these laws – and indeed spelt the gradual end of any attempt to develop a science of attractive buildings – was the number of exceptions which they seemed to let through with all the regularity of a torn fishing net. At the northern end of London’s Regent’s Park stands a mansion, constructed over 400 years after Palladio’s treatise was first published, which dutifully follows many of its tenets about proportion, the positioning of rooms, the axes of corridors and the diameters of columns. We might expect the house to have been recognised as one of the superlative buildings of contemporary London, an Anglo-Saxon heir to the Villa Rotonda, and yet, in reality, the structure has garnered less flattering verdicts and, among the more forthright, outright ridicule., LINE: 539, BOOK: The Architecture of Happiness by Alain de Botton, KEYWORD: yet despit confid assert law prove endur reput hous law inde spelt gradual end attempt develop scienc attract build wa number except let regular torn fish net northern end regent park stand mansion year treatis wa first duti mani tenet proport room ax corridor diamet column might expect hous one superl build contemporari heir villa yet realiti structur ha less flatter verdict among forthright outright ridicul

TEXT: contemporary ideals, the walls are too creamy in colour, while the materials have a lustre and flawlessness that mar the impression of aged dignity which endows Palladio’s own villas with charm. One regrets that Palladio found no opportunity to include another two dozen laws of beauty which might have placed additional tourniquets around the many sources of the mansion’s failings. Just as following Palladio seems not to lead us ineluctably towards beauty, so ignoring his advice far from condemns a house to ugliness. Imagine a cottage in the Lake District: its hall is crammed into one corner, its rooms are on no axes at all, its columns are made of thick, untreated oak, its ceilings are hardly the height of a man, and its proportions seem to hew to no mathematical formula whatsoever. And yet such a cottage may profoundly seduce us despite its violation of almost every principle contained in the authoritative pages of The Four Books of Architecture., LINE: 541, BOOK: The Architecture of Happiness by Alain de Botton, KEYWORD: contemporari ideal wall creami colour materi flawless mar impress age digniti villa charm one regret found opportun includ anoth two dozen law beauti might addit tourniquet around mani sourc mansion fail follow lead ineluct toward beauti advic far hous ugli imagin cottag lake district hall one corner room ax column made thick untreat oak ceil hardli height man proport seem hew mathemat formula whatsoev yet cottag may profoundli seduc despit violat almost everi principl authorit page four book architectur

There are floors in which large, obtuse stones have been persuaded by a mason to take their place within a methodical grid. One senses how the excesses in the character of these stones was tempered, how they were educated out of the savagery still evident in the craggy cliff-faces from which they were heaved. They had to surrender their defiance, trim their mossy beards, and smooth their warts and bunions, all for the sake of communal discipline – contributing to a floor where, as we make our way across it, we can appreciate order without danger of boredom and vigour without the shadow of anarchy., LINE: 601, BOOK: The Architecture of Happiness by Alain de Botton, KEYWORD: pleasur order combin complex doge palac flagston floor present similar pictur harmoni contrari forc floor larg obtus stone persuad mason take place within method grid one excess charact stone wa temper educ savageri still evid craggi cliff face surrend defianc trim mossi beard smooth wart bunion sake commun disciplin floor make way across appreci order without danger boredom without shadow anarchi

TEXT: For us to deem a work of architecture elegant, it is hence not enough that it look simple: we must feel that the simplicity it displays has been hard won, that it flows from the resolution of a demanding technical or natural predicament. Thus we call the Shaker staircase in Pleasant Hill elegant because we know – without ever having constructed one ourselves – that a staircase is a site complexity, and that combinations of treads, risers and banisters rarely approach the sober intelligibility of the Shakers’ work. We deem a modern Swiss house elegant because we note how seamlessly its windows have been joined to their concrete walls, and how neatly the usual clutter of construction has been resolved away. We admire starkly simple works that we intuit would, without immense effort, have appeared very complicated., LINE: 667, BOOK: The Architecture of Happiness by Alain de Botton, KEYWORD: deem work architectur eleg henc enough look simpl must feel simplic display ha hard flow resolut demand technic natur predica thu call shaker staircas pleasant hill eleg know without ever one staircas site complex combin tread riser banist rare approach sober intellig shaker work deem modern swiss hous eleg note seamlessli window concret wall neatli usual clutter construct ha resolv away admir starkli simpl work intuit would without immens effort complic
TEXT: 6.Cardinal opportunities for elegance or its opposite lie in the way that columns are designed to hold up ceilings. Even as laypeople, we are adept at guessing the thickness that would be required safely to support a structure and esteem those columns that appear most diffident about the weight they are supporting. Whereas some varieties have broad enough shoulders but look disgruntled at having been asked to carry even a single storey, others hoist up ceilings as high as those of cathedrals without apparent strain, balancing massive weights on their narrow necks as if they were holding aloft a canopy made of linen. We welcome an appearance of lightness, or even daintiness, in the face of downward pressure – columns which seem to offer us a metaphor of how we, too, should like to stand in relation to our burdens., LINE: 668, BOOK: The Architecture of Happiness by Alain de Botton, KEYWORD: cardin opportun eleg opposit lie way column design hold ceil even adept guess thick would safe support structur esteem column appear diffid weight support wherea varieti broad enough shoulder look carri even singl hoist ceil high cathedr without appar strain balanc massiv weight narrow neck hold aloft canopi made linen welcom appear light even dainti face downward pressur column seem offer metaphor like stand relat burden

TEXT: in which the windows appear to hover over their façades. Recognising, as their subsequent colleagues often have not, the intense beauty of the tenderly held pane, the city’s eighteenth-century architects competed with each other to develop frames in which the slenderest fingers of wood could fasten around the greatest expanses of glass. Pushing at the technological boundaries, they reduced glazing bars from 38mm (in the earliest houses in Queen Square) to 29mm and eventually to a mere 16 – contributing to windows with some of the same impelling grace as a Degas ballerina, fluidly pirouetting her sylph-like body on an axis of a mere five toes., LINE: 670, BOOK: The Architecture of Happiness by Alain de Botton, KEYWORD: window appear hover facad subsequ colleagu often intens beauti tenderli pane citi eighteenth centuri architect develop frame finger wood could fasten around expans glass push technolog boundari reduc glaze bar hous queen squar eventu mere window grace dega ballerina fluidli sylph like bodi axi mere five toe

TEXT:  Writing at the dawn of the age of the skyscraper, Sullivan advised his readers that many of the new tall buildings were in danger of stylistic incoherence.

TEXT: Shijo-dori, KyotoBut the failure of such attempts to rise beyond the kitsch illustrates the difficulties of finding a modern form to embody traditional features of a culture.Paper screens will not necessarily make a house Japanese in spirit; nor will concrete and patinated copper guarantee that it won’t be. The true heirs of Tokugawa houses frequently bear no simple outward resemblance to their masters: the resemblance is more subtle, relying on proportions and relations – just as the finest translators of Lady Murasaki are often those who take extensive liberties with individual words, knowing that methodical transposition is rarely the way to stay true to original intentions., LINE: 734, BOOK: The Architecture of Happiness by Alain de Botton, KEYWORD: failur attempt rise beyond difficulti find modern form embodi tradit featur cultur paper screen necessarili make hous spirit concret copper guarante true heir hous frequent bear simpl outward resembl master resembl subtl proport relat translat ladi often take extens liberti individu word know method transposit rare way stay true origin intent
TEXT: 9.I’d first noted some of the difficulties of translation in a new development in one of London’s most famous Classical squares.

And, above all, he noted, they should indicate their affinity for Brazil’s ‘white beaches, its huge mountains – and its beautiful tanned women’. A similar portrait, this time of an ideal Sri Lankan, animates Geoffrey Bawa’s Parliament Island on the outskirts of Colombo. Here the buildings are a synthesis of local and international, historical and modern, concerns, the roofs evoking the double pitch of the monasteries and royal palaces of precolonial Kandy, while the interiors successfully combine Sinhalese, Buddhist and Western features. Not only do Bawa’s buildings provide a home for the nation’s legislative government, they also grant us a seductive image of what a modern Sri Lankan citizen might be like., LINE: 750, BOOK: The Architecture of Happiness by Alain de Botton, KEYWORD: appreci burden privileg countri coloni past without sympathet modern technolog yet retain healthi play sensual note indic affin brazil white beach huge mountain beauti tan woman similar portrait time ideal sri parliament island outskirt build synthesi local intern histor modern concern roof doubl pitch monasteri royal palac interior success combin western featur build provid home nation legisl govern also grant seduct imag modern sri citizen might like

The virtues of the nation’s architecture – simplicity, efficiency, modesty, elegance – could be re-encountered in houses which to the casual eye seemed to have no contact with the past. Only on closer inspection did one realise that a sensibility almost identical to that of ancient houses had been embedded in contemporary materials., LINE: 751, BOOK: The Architecture of Happiness by Alain de Botton, KEYWORD: ideal sympathet countri white beach huge mountain beauti tan woman hous mina turn number domest build elsewher subtl sympathi inner aspir great tradit work architectur virtu nation architectur simplic effici modesti eleg could hous casual eye contact past closer inspect one sensibl almost ident ancient hous contemporari materi
TEXT: ‘A house like me’: Geoffrey Bawa, Parliament Island, Colombo, 1982On a back street in Tokyo, one such house showed a blank concrete face to the world. A front door made of steel gave onto a narrow passage which in turn opened out into a whitewashed two-storey atrium, illuminated by diffused light that shone through frosted windows in the roof. Although this was a domestic space, it had a quality of emptiness and purity more typically associated with religious buildings. In inviting a retreat from the world, the house seemed to be honouring the Zen Buddhist belief in a need to create a refuge from daily life, not in order to forgo reality but so as more closely to approach certain of its central inner truths. There were no windows with views in this house, perhaps the better to help its inhabitants see what truly needed to be observed. The light which washed down from above had the same gentle, indirect value as the glow emanating from a, LINE: 752, BOOK: The Architecture of Happiness by Alain de Botton, KEYWORD: hous like parliament island back street one hous blank concret face world front door made steel gave onto narrow passag turn two atrium illumin diffus light shone frost window roof although wa domest space qualiti empti puriti typic associ religi build invit retreat world hous belief need creat refug daili life order forgo realiti close approach certain central inner truth window view hous perhap better help inhabit see truli light wash gentl indirect valu glow

The architect had realised, as many of his lesser colleagues had not, that this luminous effect was in no way dependent on the use of paper and wood and could be achieved just as well, and in a more enduring manner, through panes of sandblasted glass. Thanks to these, the house had an otherworldly, abstracted air: to be inside it was to feel close to a realm of shadows and mist. When it rained, the pitter-patter of water sounded overhead, but the glass revealed nothing of the clouds from which the raindrops fell. This was an architecture designed to train the mind away from phenomena and towards essences., LINE: 753, BOOK: The Architecture of Happiness by Alain de Botton, KEYWORD: shoji screen architect mani lesser colleagu lumin effect wa way depend use paper wood could well endur manner pane glass thank hous otherworldli abstract air insid wa feel close realm shadow mist pitter patter water overhead glass reveal noth cloud raindrop fell wa architectur design train mind away phenomenon toward essenc

TEXT: From Le Corbusier, The Radiant City, 1933Even more than Paris, New York was for Le Corbusier the epitome of anillogical city, because it had managed to graft skyscrapers, the buildings of the future, onto a tight street plan better suited to a medieval settlement. On his trip around the United States, he advised his increasingly bemused American hosts that Manhattan ought to be demolished to make way for a fresh and more ‘Cartesian’ attempt at urban design. The division of cars and people was but one element in Le Corbusier’s plan for a thoroughgoing reorganisation of life in the new city. All functions would now be untangled. There would no longer be factories, for example, in the middle of residential areas, thus no more forging of iron while children were trying to sleep near by. The new city would be an arena of green space, clean air, ample accommodation and flowers – and not just for the few but, as a caption in The Radiant City promised, ‘for all of us!!!’, LINE: 804, BOOK: The Architecture of Happiness by Alain de Botton, KEYWORD: radiant citi even new york wa epitom citi graft skyscrap build futur onto tight street plan better mediev settlement trip around unit state advis increasingli bemus host ought make way fresh attempt urban design divis car peopl wa one element plan thoroughgo life new citi function would untangl would longer factori exampl middl residenti area thu forg iron child tri sleep near new citi would arena green space clean air ampl accommod flower caption radiant citi

A city laid out on apparently rational grounds, where different specialised facilities (the houses, the shopping centre, the library) are separated from one another across a vast terrain connected by motorways, deprives its inhabitants of the pleasures of incidental discoveries and presupposes that we march from place to place with a sense of unflagging purpose., LINE: 811, BOOK: The Architecture of Happiness by Alain de Botton, KEYWORD: admir new york precis traffic crowd difficult fruit allianc citi laid appar ration ground differ facil hous shop librari one anoth across vast terrain connect motorway inhabit pleasur incident discoveri march place place sens unflag purpos

The addition of shops and offices adds a degree of excitement to otherwise inert, dormitory areas. Contact, even of the most casual kind, with commercial enterprises gives us a transfusion of an energy we are not always capable of producing ourselves. Waking up isolated and confused at three in the morning, we can look out of the window and draw solace from the blinking neon signs in a storefront across the road, advertising bottled beer or twenty-four-hour pizza and, in their peculiar way, evoking a comforting human presence through the paranoid early hours.

TEXT:  ‘Culture’ is the word we have assigned to the force that assists us in identifying which of our many sensations we should focus on and apportion value to. In medieval Japan, poets and Zen priests directed the Japanese towards aspects of the world to which Westerners have seldom publicly accorded more than negligible or casual attention: cherry blossoms, deformed pieces of pottery, raked gravel, moss, rain falling on leaves, autumn skies, roof tiles and., LINE: 867, BOOK: The Architecture of Happiness by Alain de Botton, KEYWORD: cultur word assign forc assist mani sensat focu apport valu mediev japan poet priest direct toward aspect world western seldom publicli neglig casual attent cherri blossom deform piec potteri gravel moss rain fall leaf autumn sky roof tile
TEXT: unvarnished wood. A word emerged, wabi, of which no Western language, tellingly, has a direct equivalent, which identified beauty with unpretentious, simple, unfinished, transient things.

TEXT:  For all that we mock those who fake aesthetic enthusiasms in hopes of gaining respect, the opposite tendency is the more poignant, whereby we repress our true passions in order not to seem peculiar. We may stay quiet about our affection for daffodils, for instance, until a reading of Wordsworth endorses the sentiment, or suppress our fondness for ritualised, solemn snow-viewing until the merit of the practice is confirmed by Natsume Soseki., LINE: 879, BOOK: The Architecture of Happiness by Alain de Botton, KEYWORD: mock fake aesthet enthusiasm hope gain respect opposit tendenc poignant wherebi repress true passion order seem peculiar may stay quiet affect daffodil instanc read sentiment suppress fond solemn snow merit practic confirm

TEXT:  A few buildings and a book have usually been sufficient to provide viable models for others to follow. Nietzsche observed that the development portentously known as the ‘Italian Renaissance’, which we might imagine to have been engineered by innumerable actors, was in fact the work of only about a hundred people, while the related innovation which textbooks call the ‘rebirth of Classicism’ depended on even fewer advocates: a single structure, Brunelleschi’s Foundling Hospital, and one treatise, Leone Battista Alberti’s Ten Books on Architecture (1452), were enough to impress a new sensibility on the world., LINE: 887, BOOK: The Architecture of Happiness by Alain de Botton, KEYWORD: build book usual suffici provid viabl model follow develop portent known renaiss might imagin innumer actor wa fact work hundr peopl relat innov textbook call rebirth classic even advoc singl structur foundl hospit one treatis ten book architectur enough impress new sensibl world

TEXT: Learning to recognise the charms of raw concrete: Marte. Marte Architects, house, Voralberg, 1999In all of these tectonic shifts, the tenacity of the prime movers was every bit as important as the resources at their disposal. The great architect–revolutionaries were a synthesis of the artistic and the practical. They knew how to draw and think, but also how to cajole, charm, bully, and play long, patient, careful games with their clients and with politicians. Because the days of absolutism are over (as Le Corbusier was not the first architect regretfully to observe), we can no longer behave like Louis XIV, who would only have to wave his hand for buildings to be moved as though they were children’s blocks., LINE: 890, BOOK: The Architecture of Happiness by Alain de Botton, KEYWORD: learn charm raw concret architect hous tecton shift tenac prime mover wa everi bit import resourc dispos great architect revolutionari synthesi artist practic knew draw think also cajol charm bulli play long patient care game client politician day absolut wa first architect regret observ longer behav like would wave hand build though child block
TEXT: In a more collective, democratic era, architects have had to grow into artists of the committee meeting, people like Charles Holden who (together with Frank Pick) managed to persuade a British government instinctively opposed to serious architecture to make way for several masterpieces of station design on London’s suburban underground lines.

TEXT: ALSO BY ALAIN DE BOTTONSTATUS ANXIETYAnyone who’s ever lost sleep over an unreturned phone call or the neighbor’s Lexus had better read Alain de Botton’s irresistibly clearheaded book immediately. For in its pages, a master explicator of our civilization and its discontents turns his attention to the insatiable quest of status, a quest that has less to do with material comfort than with love. To demonstrate his thesis, de Botton ranges through Western history and thought from St. Augustine to Andrew Carnegie and Machiavelli to Anthony Robbins. Whether it’s assessing the class consciousness of Christianity or the convulsions of consumer capitalism, dueling or home-furnishing, Status Anxiety is infallibly entertaining. And when it examines the virtues of informed misanthropy, art appreciation, or walking a lobster on a leash, it is not only wise but helpful., LINE: 919, BOOK: The Architecture of Happiness by Alain de Botton, KEYWORD: also ever lost sleep unreturn phone call neighbor better read irresist clearhead book immedi page master explic civil discont turn attent insati quest statu quest ha less materi comfort love demonstr thesi rang western histori thought whether class conscious convuls consum capit duel home furnish statu anxieti infal entertain virtu inform misanthropi art appreci walk lobster leash wise help

TEXT: Self-Help/Philosophy/978-0-679-77917-9THE ART OF TRAVELAny Baedeker will tell us where we ought to travel, but only Alain de Botton will tell us how and why. With the same intelligence and insouciant charm he brought to How Proust Can Change Your Life, de Botton considers the pleasures of anticipation, the allure of the exotic, and the value of noticing everything from a seascape in Barbados to the takeoffs at Heathrow. Even as de Botton takes the reader along on his own peregrinations, he also cites such distinguished fellow- travelers as Baudelaire, Wordsworth, van Gogh, the biologist Alexander von Humboldt, and the eighteenth-century eccentric Xavier de Maistre, who catalogued the wonders of his bedroom. The Art of Travel is a wise and utterly original book., LINE: 925, BOOK: The Architecture of Happiness by Alain de Botton, KEYWORD: self help philosophi art tell ought travel tell intellig insouci charm brought chang life pleasur anticip allur exot valu everyth seascap even take reader along peregrin also cite distinguish fellow travel van biologist eighteenth centuri eccentr wonder bedroom art travel wise utterli origin book
TEXT: Travel/Essays/978-0-375-72534-0HOW PROUST CAN CHANGE YOUR LIFEAlain de Botton combines two unlikely genres—literary biography and self-help manual—in the hilarious and unexpectedly practical How Proust Can Change Your Life. Who would have thought that Marcel Proust, one of the most important writers of our time, could provide us with such a rich source of insight into how best to live life? As relevant today as they were at the turn of the century, Proust’s life and work are transformed here into a no-nonsense guide to, among other things, achieving original and unclichéd articulation, and being a good host. It took de Botton to find the inspirational in Proust’s essays, letters, and fiction and—perhaps even more surprising—to draw out a vivid and clarifying portrait of the master from between the lines of his work.
