TEXT:  B was not intended to replace A but to simply add another dimension, something to compare it to and facilitate discussion. Ideally, C, D, E, and many others would follow.This book unpacks the B bit of the list, making connections between usually disparate ideas, locating them within an expanded notion of contemporary design practice, and establishing some historical links., LINE: 2, BOOK: Speculative Everything by Anthony Dunne, KEYWORD: wa intend replac simpli add anoth dimens someth compar facilit discuss ideal mani would follow book bit list make connect usual dispar idea within expand notion contemporari design practic histor link
TEXT:  It is not a straightforward survey, anthology of essays, or monograph but offers a very specific view of design based on several years of experimentation, teaching, and reflection.

TEXT:  In researching this book we also surveyed literature from futurology, cinematic and literary fiction, political theory, and the philosophy of technology.The ideas in this book move from a general setting out of what conceptual design is, through its use as a critical medium for exploring the implications of new developments in science and technology, to the aesthetics of crafting speculative designs., LINE: 4, BOOK: Speculative Everything by Anthony Dunne, KEYWORD: book also literatur cinemat literari fiction polit theori philosophi technolog idea book move gener set conceptu design use critic medium explor implic new develop scienc technolog aesthet specul design

TEXT: Dreams are powerful. They are repositories of our desire. They animate the entertainment industry and drive consumption. They can blind people to reality and provide cover for political horror. But they can also inspire us to imagine that things could be radically different than they are today, and then believe we can progress toward that imaginary world., LINE: 17, BOOK: Speculative Everything by Anthony Dunne, KEYWORD: dream power repositori desir anim entertain industri drive consumpt blind peopl realiti provid cover polit horror also inspir imagin thing could radic differ today believ progress toward imaginari world

TEXT:  There are no more visions. We don't know how to fix the planet and ensure our survival. We are just hopeful.

TEXT:  Yet alternatives are exactly what we need. We need to dream new dreams for the twenty-first century as those of the twentieth century rapidly fade. But what role can design play?When people think of design, most believe it is about problem solving., LINE: 20, BOOK: Speculative Everything by Anthony Dunne, KEYWORD: yet altern exactli need need dream new dream twenti first centuri twentieth centuri rapidli fade role design play peopl think design believ problem
TEXT:  Even the more expressive forms of design are about solving aesthetic problems. Faced with huge challenges such as overpopulation, water shortages, and climate change, designers feel an overpowering urge to work together to fix them, as though they can be broken down, quantified, and solved., LINE: 21, BOOK: Speculative Everything by Anthony Dunne, KEYWORD: even express form design aesthet problem face huge challeng overpopul water shortag climat chang design feel overpow urg work togeth fix though broken
TEXT:  Design's inherent optimism leaves no alternative but it is becoming clear that many of the challenges we face today are unfixable and that the only way to overcome them is by changing our values, beliefs, attitudes, and behavior., LINE: 22, BOOK: Speculative Everything by Anthony Dunne, KEYWORD: design inher optim leaf altern becom clear mani challeng face today unfix way overcom valu belief attitud behavior
TEXT:  Although essential most of the time, design's inbuilt optimism can greatly complicate things, first, as a form of denial that the problems we face are more serious than they appear, and second, by channeling energy and resources into fiddling with the world out there rather than the ideas and attitudes inside our heads that shape the world out there., LINE: 23, BOOK: Speculative Everything by Anthony Dunne, KEYWORD: although essenti time design inbuilt optim greatli complic thing first form denial problem face seriou appear second channel energi resourc fiddl world rather idea attitud insid head shape world
TEXT: Rather than giving up altogether, though, there are other possibilities for design: one is to use design as a means of speculating how things could be-speculative design. This form of design thrives on imagination and aims to open up new perspectives on what are sometimes called wicked problems, to create spaces for discussion and debate about alternative ways of being, and to inspire and encourage people's imaginations to flow freely., LINE: 24, BOOK: Speculative Everything by Anthony Dunne, KEYWORD: rather give altogeth though possibl design one use design mean thing could specul design form design imagin aim open new perspect sometim wick problem creat space discuss debat altern way inspir encourag peopl imagin flow freeli

TEXT: " Usually it is concerned with predicting or forecasting the future, sometimes it is about new trends and identifying weak signals that can be extrapolated into the near future, but it is always about trying to pin the future down., LINE: 26, BOOK: Speculative Everything by Anthony Dunne, KEYWORD: usual concern forecast futur sometim new trend weak signal near futur alway tri pin futur
TEXT:  This is something we are absolutely not interested in; when it comes to technology, future predictions have been proven wrong again and again. In our view, it is a pointless activity. What we are interested in, though, is the idea of possible futures and using them as tools to better understand the present and to discuss the kind of future people want, and, of course, ones people do not want., LINE: 27, BOOK: Speculative Everything by Anthony Dunne, KEYWORD: someth absolut interest come technolog futur predict proven wrong view pointless activ interest though idea possibl futur tool better understand present discu kind futur peopl want cours one peopl want
TEXT:  They usually take the form of scenarios, often starting with a what-if question, and are intended to open up spaces of debate and discussion; therefore, they are by necessity provocative, intentionally simplified, and fictional., LINE: 28, BOOK: Speculative Everything by Anthony Dunne, KEYWORD: usual take form scenario often start question intend open space debat discuss therefor necess provoc intent simplifi fiction
TEXT:  Their fictional nature requires viewers to suspend their disbelief and allow their imaginations to wander, to momentarily forget how things are now, and wonder about how things could be. We rarely develop scenarios that suggest how things should be because it becomes too didactic and even moralistic., LINE: 29, BOOK: Speculative Everything by Anthony Dunne, KEYWORD: fiction natur viewer suspend disbelief allow imagin wander momentarili forget thing wonder thing could rare develop scenario suggest thing becom didact even moralist
TEXT:  For us futures are not a destination or something to be strived for but a medium to aid imaginative thought-to speculate with. Not just about the future but about today as well, and this is where they become critique, especially when they highlight limitations that can be removed and loosen, even just a bit, reality's grip on our imagination., LINE: 30, BOOK: Speculative Everything by Anthony Dunne, KEYWORD: futur destin someth strive medium aid imagin thought specul futur today well becom critiqu especi highlight limit remov loosen even bit realiti grip imagin
TEXT:  As all design to some extent is future oriented, we are very interested in positioning design speculation in relation to futurology, speculative culture including literature and cinema, fine art, and radical social science concerned with changing reality rather than simply describing it or maintaining it., LINE: 31, BOOK: Speculative Everything by Anthony Dunne, KEYWORD: design extent futur interest design specul relat specul cultur literatur cinema fine art radic social scienc concern realiti rather simpli
TEXT: 2 This space lies somewhere between reality and the impossible and to operate in it effectively, as a designer, requires new design roles, contexts, and methods.

TEXT: To find inspiration for speculating through design we need to look beyond design to the methodological playgrounds of cinema, literature, science, ethics, politics, and art; to explore, hybridize, borrow, and embrace the many tools available for crafting not only things but also ideasfictional worlds, cautionary tales, what-if scenarios, thought experiments, counterfactuals, reductio ad absurdum experiments, prefigurative futures, and so on., LINE: 33, BOOK: Speculative Everything by Anthony Dunne, KEYWORD: find inspir design need look beyond design methodolog playground cinema literatur scienc ethic polit art explor hybrid borrow embrac mani tool avail thing also world cautionari tale scenario thought experi experi prefigur futur

TEXT: 3 It consisted of a number of cones fanning out from the present into the future. Each cone represented different levels of likelihood. We were very taken by this imperfect but helpful diagram and adapted it for our own purposes., LINE: 35, BOOK: Speculative Everything by Anthony Dunne, KEYWORD: number cone fan present futur cone differ level likelihood taken imperfect help diagram purpos
TEXT: The first cone was the probable. This is where most designers operate. It describes what is likely to happen unless there is some extreme upheaval such as a financial crash, eco disaster, or war. Most design methods, processes, tools, acknowledged good practice, and even design education are oriented toward this space., LINE: 36, BOOK: Speculative Everything by Anthony Dunne, KEYWORD: first cone wa probabl design oper like happen unless extrem upheav financi crash disast war design method process tool acknowledg good practic even design educ toward space
TEXT:  How designs are evaluated is also closely linked to a thorough understanding of probable futures, although it is rarely expressed in those terms. The next cone describes plausible futures.

TEXT:  In the 1970s companies such as Royal Dutch Shell developed techniques for modeling alternative near-future global situations to ensure that they would survive through a number of large-scale, global, economic, or political shifts., LINE: 38, BOOK: Speculative Everything by Anthony Dunne, KEYWORD: compani royal dutch shell techniqu model altern near futur global situat ensur would surviv number larg scale global econom polit shift

TEXT: The next cone is the possible. The skill here is making links between today's world and the suggested one. Michio Kaku's book Physics of the Impossible4 sets out three classes of impossibility, and even in the third, the most extreme-things that are not possible according to our current understanding of science-there are only two, perpetual motion and precognition, which, based on our current understanding of science, are impossible., LINE: 40, BOOK: Speculative Everything by Anthony Dunne, KEYWORD: next cone possibl skill make link today world one book physic imposs set three class imposs even third extrem thing possibl accord current understand scienc two perpetu motion precognit base current understand scienc imposs
TEXT:  All other changes-political, social, economic, and culturalare not impossible but it can difficult to imagine how we would get from here to there.

TEXT:  A believable series of events that led to the new situation is necessary, even if entirely fictional. This allows viewers to relate the scenario to their own world and to use it as an aid for critical reflection., LINE: 42, BOOK: Speculative Everything by Anthony Dunne, KEYWORD: believ seri event led new situat necessari even entir fiction viewer relat scenario world use aid critic reflect
TEXT:  This is the space of speculative culture-writing, cinema, science fiction, social fiction, and so on. Although speculative, experts are often consulted when building these scenarios, as David Kirby points out in a fascinating chapter about distinctions between what he calls speculative scenarios and fantastic science in his book Lab Coats in Hollywood; the role of the expert is often, not to prevent the impossible but to make it acceptable., LINE: 43, BOOK: Speculative Everything by Anthony Dunne, KEYWORD: space specul cultur write cinema scienc fiction social fiction although specul expert often build scenario point fascin chapter distinct call specul scenario fantast scienc book lab coat role expert often prevent imposs make accept
TEXT: 5Beyond this lies the zone of fantasy, an area we have little interest in. Fantasy exists in its own world, with very few if any links to the world we live in.

TEXT:  This is the space of fairy tales, goblins, superheroes, and space opera.A final cone intersects the probable and plausible. This is the cone of preferable futures. Of course the idea of preferable is not so straightforward; what does preferable mean, for whom, and who decides? Currently, it is determined by government and industry, and although we play a role as consumers and voters, it is a limited one., LINE: 45, BOOK: Speculative Everything by Anthony Dunne, KEYWORD: space fairi tale goblin space opera final cone probabl plausibl cone prefer futur cours idea prefer straightforward doe prefer mean current determin govern industri although play role consum voter limit one
TEXT:  In Imaginary Futures, Richard Barbrook explores futures as tools designed for organizing and justifying the present in the interests of a powerful minority.6 But, assuming it is possible to create more socially constructive imaginary futures, could design help people participate more actively as citizen-consumers?

TEXT: We believe that by speculating more, at all levels of society, and exploring alternative scenarios, reality will become more malleable and, although the future cannot be predicted, we can help set in place today factors that will increase the probability of more desirable futures happening., LINE: 50, BOOK: Speculative Everything by Anthony Dunne, KEYWORD: believ level societi explor altern scenario realiti becom malleabl although futur cannot help set place today factor increas probabl desir futur happen

TEXT: We believe several key changes have happened since the high point of radical design in the 1970s that make imaginative, social, and political speculation today more difficult and less likely.

TEXT:  There was some good in this-design was embraced by big business and entered the mainstream but usually only in the most superficial way.

TEXT:  The great modernist social dreams of the post-war era probably reached a peak in the 1970s when it started to become clear that the planet had limited resources and we were using them up fast.

TEXT:  A more concrete example is MTKS-3/The Meta-territorial Kitchen System-3 (2003) by Marti Guixe.

TEXT: It is often said that if something is conceptual, it is only an idea, but that is missing the point. It is because it is an idea that it is important. New ideas are exactly what we need today. Conceptual designs are not only ideas but also ideals, and as the moral philosopher Susan Neiman has pointed out, we should measure reality against ideals, not the other way around: "Ideals are not measured by whether they conform to reality; reality is judged by whether it lives up to ideals., LINE: 79, BOOK: Speculative Everything by Anthony Dunne, KEYWORD: often said someth conceptu idea miss point idea import new idea exactli need today conceptu design idea also ideal moral philosoph ha point measur realiti ideal way around ideal measur whether conform realiti realiti whether life ideal

TEXT:  The ideal is a practical fiction."10A MAP OF UNREALITYThe spectrum of conceptual design is broad. Each area of design has its own form and is used in different ways.

TEXT:  It is at the level of ideas that the craft of conceptual design happens.

TEXT: To be human is to refuse to accept the given as given.'Once we accept that conceptual design is more than a style option, corporate propaganda, or designer self-promotion, what uses can it take on?

TEXT:  It is not enough that it simply exists and can be used to experiment or entertain; we also want it to be useful, to have a sort of social usefulness, specifically, to question, critique, and challenge the way technologies enter our lives and the limitations they place on people through their narrow definition of what it means to be human, or as Andrew Feenberg writes, "The most important question to ask about modern societies is therefore what understanding of human life is embodied in the prevailing technical arrangements ., LINE: 151, BOOK: Speculative Everything by Anthony Dunne, KEYWORD: enough simpli use experi entertain also want use sort social use specif question critiqu challeng way technolog enter life limit place peopl narrow definit mean human import question ask modern societi therefor understand human life technic arrang
TEXT: ,,2CRITICAL DESIGNWe coined the term critical design in the mid-nineties when we were researchers in the Computer Related Design Research Studio at the Royal College of Art.

TEXT:  Critical designs are testimonials to what could be, but at the same time, they offer alternatives that highlight weaknesses within existing normality.

TEXT:  This is where critical design gets confused with commentary. All good critical design offers an alternative to how things are.

TEXT:  It depends on dialectical opposition between fiction and reality to have an effect. Critical design uses commentary but it is only one layer of many. Ultimately it is positive and idealistic because we believe that change is possible, that things can be better; it is just that the way of getting there is different; it is an intellectual journey based on challenging and changing values, ideas, and beliefs., LINE: 165, BOOK: Speculative Everything by Anthony Dunne, KEYWORD: dialect opposit fiction realiti effect critic design us commentari one layer mani ultim posit idealist believ chang possibl thing better way get differ intellectu journey base valu idea belief

TEXT:  In today's economy it is as consumers that we have power. The most threatening act of protest for a capitalist system would be for its citizens to refuse to consume. As Erik Olin Wright points out, "If somehow it were to come to pass that large numbers of people in a capitalist society were able to resist the preferences shaped by consumerist culture and opt for `voluntary simplicity' with lower consumption and much more leisure time, this would precipitate a severe economic crisis, for if demand in the market were to significantly decline, the profits of many capitalist firms would collapse., LINE: 174, BOOK: Speculative Everything by Anthony Dunne, KEYWORD: today economi consum power threaten act protest capitalist system would citizen refus consum wright point somehow come larg number peopl capitalist societi abl resist prefer shape cultur opt voluntari simplic lower consumpt much leisur time would precipit sever econom crisi demand market significantli declin profit mani capitalist firm would collaps
TEXT: "8As we can see from the current economic crisis: "The state's role in promoting the consumption bias inherent in capitalist economies is particularly sharply revealed in times of economic crisis. In an economic downturn, governments attempt to `stimulate' the economy by, in various ways, encouraging people to consume more by reducing taxes, by reducing interest rates so borrowing is cheaper or, in some cases, by directly giving people more money to spend., LINE: 175, BOOK: Speculative Everything by Anthony Dunne, KEYWORD: see current econom crisi state role consumpt bia inher capitalist economi particularli sharpli reveal time econom crisi econom downturn govern attempt stimul economi variou way encourag peopl consum reduc tax reduc interest rate borrow case directli give peopl money spend

TEXT:  In a consumer society, the moment we part with our money is the moment a little bit of reality is created. Not just physical reality or cultural but psychological, ethical, and behavioral.

TEXT:  DARK DESIGN: THE POSITIVE USE OF NEGATIVITYOne of critical design's roles is to question the limited range of emotional and psychological experiences offered through designed products.

TEXT:  Darkness as an antidote to naive techno-utopianism can jolt people into action. In design, darkness creates a frisson that excites and challenges.

Hopfengaertner asks what would happen if one of the tech industry's many dreams comes true, if all the research being done by separate companies into making humans machine readable were to combine and move from laboratory to everyday life: combined algorithms and camera systems that can read emotions from faces, gait, and demeanor; neurotechnologies that cannot exactly read minds but can make a good guess at what people are thinking; profiling software that tracks and traces our every click and purchase; and so on., LINE: 183, BOOK: Speculative Everything by Anthony Dunne, KEYWORD: good exampl belief system would happen one tech industri mani dream come true research done separ compani make human machin readabl combin move laboratori everyday life combin algorithm camera system read emot face gait demeanor cannot exactli read mind make good guess peopl think track trace everi click purchas

TEXT:  In another, a person is trying to identify muscle groups in her face so she can learn to control them and not give her feelings away, voluntarily becoming inhuman in order to protect her humanity. For some this is the ultimate user-centered dream, but for many Hopfengaertner's project is a cautionary tale fast-forwarding to a time when currently diverse technologies are combined to ease our every interaction with technology., LINE: 185, BOOK: Speculative Everything by Anthony Dunne, KEYWORD: anoth person tri identifi muscl group face learn control give feel away voluntarili becom inhuman order protect human ultim user center dream mani project cautionari tale fast forward time current divers technolog combin eas everi interact technolog

TEXT:  It helps resist streamlined thinking and instrumental logic that leads to passive acceptance; it is disruptive and appeals to the imagination.Good political comedians do this well. Probably the most celebrated artists working in this way are The Yes Men (Jacques Servin and Igor Vamos) who use satire, shock tactics, caricature, hoaxes, fakery, spoofing, absurdity, and "identity correction" (impersonating target organizations and individuals) to raise awareness of the mistreatment of ordinary people by large corporations and governments., LINE: 189, BOOK: Speculative Everything by Anthony Dunne, KEYWORD: help resist streamlin think instrument logic lead passiv accept disrupt appeal imagin good polit comedian well probabl celebr artist work way ye men use satir shock tactic caricatur hoax fakeri absurd ident correct target organ individu rais awar mistreat ordinari peopl larg corpor govern

TEXT:  A critical design should be demanding, challenging, and if it is going to raise awareness, do so for issues that are not already well known.

TEXT:  This is where design enters; we can take research happening in laboratories and fastforward to explore possible applications driven by human desire rather than therapeutic need. By facilitating debate on the implications of advanced research in science, design can take on a practical, almost social purpose, and in doing so, play a role in the democratization of technological change by widening participation in debates about future technologies., LINE: 229, BOOK: Speculative Everything by Anthony Dunne, KEYWORD: design take research happen laboratori explor possibl applic driven human desir rather therapeut need debat implic advanc research scienc design take practic almost social purpos play role democrat technolog chang particip debat futur technolog
TEXT: To do this we need to move design upstream, beyond product, beyond technology, to the concept or research stage, and to develop speculative designs, or "useful fictions," for facilitating debate.

TEXT:  Related to this is the idea of artist residencies in the research labs of high-tech companies where artists are given free rein to respond to and use work happening around them.

TEXT:  The aim is to develop a poetic and conceptually interesting project through a dialogue that can in some way be commercialized.

TEXT:  Of course this model does not always lead to harmonious outcomes or partnerships. Sometimes an artist may perceive negative implications for the research, but if scientists, or especially a company, opens their laboratory up to an artist or designer and share their research, research that may have taken years to develop, it feels wrong, almost treacherous, to pick up on negative possibilities., LINE: 259, BOOK: Speculative Everything by Anthony Dunne, KEYWORD: cours model doe alway lead harmoni outcom partnership sometim artist may perceiv neg implic research scientist especi compani open laboratori artist design share research research may taken year develop feel wrong almost treacher pick neg possibl

TEXT:  A speculative design proposal can also serve as a "probe" for highlighting legal and ethical limits to existing systems. This form of speculative project usually falls outside the context of SciArt.

TEXT: Many of the goals driving tissue engineering are concerned with replacing existing organs or body parts-flesh, hearts, breasts, kidneys, corneas, and so on.

TEXT:  This is not a concrete design proposal but a hope for tissue engineering expressed through an imaginary product, in this case an incubator that uses human skin. Its purpose is to ask, Will new biotechnologies enable us to move beyond the current highly technical language of medical technology to a more humane one? Another issue the project touches on is once you start to use semiliving materials such as skin, what happens with built-in obsolescence?

TEXT:  Probably the most abstract discussion is in philosophy where differences between the many shades of real, fictional, possible, actual, unreal, and imaginary are teased out. In social and political science the focus is on modeling reality; in literary theory it is on the semantics of the real and nonreal ; in fine art, make-believe theory and fiction; in game design, literal world creation; and even in science there are many rich strands of discourse around fictionalism, useful fictions, model organisms, and multiverses., LINE: 329, BOOK: Speculative Everything by Anthony Dunne, KEYWORD: probabl abstract discuss philosophi differ mani shade real fiction possibl actual unreal imaginari social polit scienc focu model realiti literari theori semant real fine art make believ theori fiction game design liter world creation even scienc mani rich strand discours around use fiction model organ

TEXT:  Corporate parody and pastiche have become the norm, and although Black Mirror has moved well beyond this, it is the exception. Maybe this is one of the limitations of cinema; it can deliver a very powerful story and immersive experience but requires a degree of passivity in the viewer reinforced by easily recognized and understood visual cues, something we will return to in chapter 6., LINE: 358, BOOK: Speculative Everything by Anthony Dunne, KEYWORD: corpor parodi pastich becom norm although black mirror ha well beyond except mayb one limit cinema deliv power stori immers experi degre passiv viewer easili understood visual cue someth return chapter
TEXT:  Literature makes us work so much harder because readers need to construct everything about the fictional world in their imagination.

TEXT: IDEAS AS STORIESIn these examples, it is the backdrop that interests us, not the narrative; the values of the society the story takes place in rather than the plot and characters.

TEXT:  It has too much to explain, to be one of those.

TEXT:  It is a piece of speculative economics exploring an alternative economic model to our own, a planned economy where everything is centrally controlled, and it unapologetically focuses on ideas. This approach is similar to design writing experiments such as The World, Who Wants it? by architect Ben Nicholson and The Post - spectacular Economy by design critic Justin McGuirk., LINE: 363, BOOK: Speculative Everything by Anthony Dunne, KEYWORD: piec specul econom explor altern econom model economi everyth central focu idea approach similar design write experi world want architect ben post spectacular economi design critic

TEXT: In After Man-A Zoology of the Future (1981) Dougal Dixon explores a world without people focusing exclusively on biology, meteorology, and environmental sciences.

TEXT:  As well as highly regarded works of literature, Margaret Atwood's novels are stories of ideas.

TEXT:  The world she creates serves as a cautionary tale based on the fusion of biotechnology and a free-market system driven by human desire and novelty, where only human needs count. Unlike many sci-fi writers, Atwood is far more interested in the social, cultural, and ethical implications of science and technology than the technology itself., LINE: 375, BOOK: Speculative Everything by Anthony Dunne, KEYWORD: world serf cautionari tale base fusion free market system driven human desir novelti human need count unlik mani writer far interest social cultur ethic implic scienc technolog technolog
TEXT:  She resists the label of sci-fi preferring to describe her work as speculative literature.

TEXT:  Similar to Dixon's After Man the book is full of imaginative and strange designs but based on biotechnology. Each design highlights issues as well as entertaining and moving the story along.Whereas Oryx and Crake creates plausibility through an extrapolation of current scientific research, one of our favorite books, Will Self's The Book of Dav e uses a far more idiosyncratic mechanism for establishing a link with today's world., LINE: 377, BOOK: Speculative Everything by Anthony Dunne, KEYWORD: similar man book full imagin strang design base design highlight issu well entertain move stori along wherea crake plausibl extrapol current scientif research one favorit book self book us far idiosyncrat mechan link today world

TEXT:  That these lead to so much sadness and misery is tragic, and this book captures the ridiculousness of political and religious dogma.

TEXT:  The Book of Dave is a dense, inventive, highly original, complex, and layered portrayal of a fictional world. But is it possible to apply this to design? We think it is.

TEXT:  China Mieville's The City and the City is based on poetic and contemporary ideas about artificial borders. Two cities, Beszel and UI Coma coexist in one geographical zone, in one city. A crime is committed that links the two cities so the protagonist, inspector Tyador BorI0, must work across borders to solve it, something that's usually avoided at all costs because citizens of each city no longer see or acknowledge each other even while using the same streets and sometimes the same buildings., LINE: 383, BOOK: Speculative Everything by Anthony Dunne, KEYWORD: china citi citi base poetic contemporari idea artifici border two citi coma coexist one geograph zone one citi crime link two citi protagonist inspector must work across border solv someth usual cost citizen citi longer see acknowledg even street sometim build
TEXT:  To see the other city or one of its inhabitants is a "breach," the most serious of all crimes imaginable.

TEXT:  As Geoff Manaugh points out in an interview with the author, it is essentially poli-sci fiction.14 Everything in this book is familiar; it is the reconceptualization of a simple and familiar technical idea, the border, that makes it relevant to design, again, more for its method than its content., LINE: 385, BOOK: Speculative Everything by Anthony Dunne, KEYWORD: point interview author essenti fiction everyth book familiar simpl familiar technic idea border make relev design method content

TEXT: Can design embrace this level of invention or are we limited to more concrete ways of making fictional worlds? One strength for design is that its medium exists in the here and now.

TEXT:  How to Live Safely in a Science Fictional Universe makes us wonder about speculative design's complex relationship to reality and the need to celebrate and enjoy its unreality. THOUGHT EXPERIMENTSOne way this might be possible is to treat design speculations not as narratives or coherent "worlds" but as thought experiments-constructions, crafted from ideas expressed through design-that help us think about difficult issues., LINE: 391, BOOK: Speculative Everything by Anthony Dunne, KEYWORD: live safe scienc fiction univers make wonder specul design complex relationship realiti need celebr enjoy unreal thought way might possibl treat design specul narr coher world thought experi construct idea express design help think difficult issu

TEXT: REDUCTIO AD ABSURDUMOne of our favorite forms of thought experiment uses reductio ad absurdum, a type of logical argument in which one assumes a claim for the sake of argument and derives an absurd or ridiculous outcome by taking it to its extreme, concluding that the original claim must have been wrong because it led to such an absurd result., LINE: 396, BOOK: Speculative Everything by Anthony Dunne, KEYWORD: favorit form thought experi us type logic argument one claim sake argument absurd ridicul outcom take extrem conclud origin claim must wrong led absurd result
TEXT:  It lends itself well to humor, too. Thomas Thwaites's The Toaster Project (2009) is a good example.Thwaites set out to build a toaster from scratch.

TEXT:  Over the next nine months he visited mines, extracted iron from ore, tracked down mica in Scotland, and eventually made an almost working toaster. Thwaites knew from the start it was an impossible task but used the quest, which was recorded on video and later published as a book, to highlight how dependent we have become on technology and how far removed we are from the processes and systems behind most of the technologies and devices our everyday lives depend on., LINE: 398, BOOK: Speculative Everything by Anthony Dunne, KEYWORD: next nine month mine extract iron ore track mica eventu made almost work toaster knew start wa imposs task use quest wa video later book highlight depend becom technolog far remov process system behind technolog devic everyday life depend

TEXT:  As outlandish as it is, SlaveCity is still based on logic and is closer to the logical fantasy of John Wyndham and other writers than Charles Yu's How to Live Safely in a Science Fictional Universe.

TEXT:  Atelier Van Lieshout, Welcoming Center, 2007. FICTIONEERS IN DENIALThe problem with speculation, for designers at least, is that it is fictional, which is still seen as a bad thing.

TEXT:  Designers today are expert fictioneers in denial. Although there have always been design speculations (e.g., car shows, future visions, haute couture fashions shows), design has become so absorbed in industry, so familiar with the dreams of industry, that it is almost impossible to dream its own dreams, let alone social ones., LINE: 428, BOOK: Speculative Everything by Anthony Dunne, KEYWORD: design today expert denial although alway design specul car show futur vision fashion show design ha becom absorb industri familiar dream industri almost imposs dream dream let alon social one

TEXT: For us, the purpose of speculation is to "unsettle the present rather than predict the future. ,17 But to fully exploit this potential, design needs to decouple itself from industry, develop its social imagination more fully, embrace speculative culture, and then, maybe, as MoMA curator Paola Antonelli suggests, we might see the beginnings of a theoretical form of design dedicated to thinking, reflecting, inspiring, and providing new perspectives on some of the challenges facing us., LINE: 430, BOOK: Speculative Everything by Anthony Dunne, KEYWORD: purpos specul unsettl present rather predict futur fulli exploit potenti design need industri develop social imagin fulli embrac specul cultur mayb curat might see begin theoret form design think reflect inspir provid new perspect challeng face

TEXT:  The presence of the prop in the same space as the imaginer also makes the experience more vivid, more alive, and more intense.

TEXT:  Whereas a child uses props to imagine a box is a house or a rock is an alien, speculative design props are intended not to mimic reality or allow us to play act but to entertain new ideas, thoughts, and possibilities for an alternative world from the one we and the prop coexist in, what Kendall calls "fictional propositions" in contrast to the "fictional truths" of children's props., LINE: 450, BOOK: Speculative Everything by Anthony Dunne, KEYWORD: wherea child us prop imagin box hous rock alien specul design prop intend mimic realiti allow play act entertain new idea thought possibl altern world one prop coexist call fiction proposit contrast fiction truth child prop

TEXT:  What makes them different from products is that they do not "fit" into today's world, especially the commercial world. This is what makes them "unreal." They are at odds with how things are.

Prefigurative futures (or pre-enactments?) also use props to transport viewers' imagination9 but, whereas in this role they are bringing a specific future to the present so that it can be partially experienced in advance, user-tested, or prepared for, we are more interested in using props to transport viewers' imagination into a thought experiment, or what-if, and allow enough room for them to make their own interpretations., LINE: 459, BOOK: Speculative Everything by Anthony Dunne, KEYWORD: someth peopl visit museum view histor artifact often carri sort imaginari artifact display prefigur futur enact also use prop transport viewer imagin wherea role specif futur present partial experienc advanc user test prepar interest prop transport viewer imagin thought experi allow enough room make interpret

TEXT:  The closest relatives we can think of are historical everyday artifacts in museum collections that prompt us to imagine what life must have been like in those societies.

TEXT:  Photograph © Troika 2010.There is another subtle distinction that needs to be managed during the creation of speculative design props: the difference between believable and plausible.

TEXT: In How Fiction Works, James Wood writes,the novelist is always working with at least three languages. There is the author's own language, style, perceptual equipment, and so on; there is the character's presumed language, style perceptual equipment, and so on; and there is what we could call the language of the world-the language which fiction inherits before it gets to turn it into novelistic style, the language of daily speech, of newspapers, of offices, of advertising, of the blogosphere and text messaging., LINE: 475, BOOK: Speculative Everything by Anthony Dunne, KEYWORD: fiction work wood novelist alway work least three languag author languag style perceptu equip charact languag style perceptu equip could call languag world languag fiction get turn novelist style languag daili speech newspap offic advertis text

TEXT: This chapter focuses on the poetics of speculation in the classic sense of how speculation works but also in the sense of poetry-compressed, layered meaning.

TEXT:  It comes from an overeagerness to make speculations seem real. In this chapter we explore aesthetic potential beyond realism, embracing and celebrating the unreal status of speculative design props.AESTHETICS AND SPECULATIONWhen we think of the aesthetics of speculation, very specific examples of 1970s and 1980s science fiction imagery immediately spring to mind: illustrators such as Syd Mead and Chris Foss, for example., LINE: 499, BOOK: Speculative Everything by Anthony Dunne, KEYWORD: come overeag make specul seem real chapter explor aesthet potenti beyond realism embrac unreal statu specul design prop aesthet think aesthet specul specif exampl scienc fiction imageri immedi spring mind illustr mead exampl

TEXT:  Over the years the use of CGI has evolved enormously in terms of technology but not so much aesthetically.

TEXT:  In a way, the software is the voice behind the imagery. It is not much different in design; although the hyperrealistic computer graphic Nonobjects (2010) of Branko Lukic are seductive, their CGI look firmly locates them in a recent tradition of speculative design exercises., LINE: 502, BOOK: Speculative Everything by Anthony Dunne, KEYWORD: way voic behind imageri much differ design although comput graphic seduct look firmli recent tradit specul design exercis
TEXT: 3 The most exciting nonobject for us is nUCLEUS, Lukic's design for a motorbike, because of its highly abstracted nonmotorbike form and its seductively ambiguous plausibility.

TEXT:  Although at first they look realistic, on closer inspection all sorts of oddities begin to appear: the buildings are often in the form of three-dimensional letters for instance.

TEXT:  Usually, characters are given far more straightforward roles by designers, but that's changing. With Menstruation Machine: Takashi's Take (2010) designer Sputniko (aka Hiromi Ozaki) builds a project around Takashi, a man who enjoys dressing up as a woman, but this is not enough, so he builds the menstruation machine to get closer to experiencing what it feels like to be a woman, going beyond visual appearance to experiment with biology., LINE: 566, BOOK: Speculative Everything by Anthony Dunne, KEYWORD: usual charact given far straightforward role design menstruat machin take design aka build project around man dress woman enough build menstruat machin get closer feel like woman go beyond visual appear experi biolog
TEXT:  The machine simulates the sensation of the average female menstruation period using a blood dispenser and lower - abdomen - stimulating electrodes.

TEXT: NONPLACESThere is an assumption with speculative work that it is oriented toward the future, but it can simply be somewhere else, a parallel world to our own rather than a possible future.

TEXT:  The thinking seems to be that this will make the future more believable but it has become a hackneyed worldview.

TEXT:  Instead of appearing absurd, they are pathetic and downtrodden. They are not at odds with their surroundings at all, but like the space ship they arrived in, they visually blend in.

TEXT:  New elements are blended into an existing London; Battersea Bridge, for example, becomes a sentry gate to the Ministry of Art's "Ark of Arts," a fusion of Tate Modern and Battersea Power Station. This treatment creates a powerful atmosphere but it is a little less visually interesting, something the production team on Children of Men openly acknowledged because they aimed for reference rather than invention., LINE: 583, BOOK: Speculative Everything by Anthony Dunne, KEYWORD: new element blend bridg exampl becom sentri gate ministri art ark art fusion tate modern power station treatment power atmospher littl less visual interest someth product team child men openli acknowledg refer rather invent

TEXT:  Little anachronistic details such as the clones having to touch an ID card to a reader to enter certain spaces work very well at reminding us that this is not the past.

TEXT:  A notable exception is Cube (1997) by Vincenzo Natali in which a group of people are trapped in a minimal, abstracted puzzle environment they must escape from. Constructed spaces like this allow designers to introduce estrangement, gently forcing viewers to make sense of what they are looking at rather than simply recognizing or reading the cues., LINE: 593, BOOK: Speculative Everything by Anthony Dunne, KEYWORD: notabl except cube group peopl trap minim abstract puzzl environ must escap space like allow design introduc estrang gentli forc viewer make sens look rather simpli read cue

TEXT:  In each room a person is doing something inexplicable involving costumes, props, and graphics.

If, rather than looking back in time, we presented people with fictional artifacts from alternative versions of our own society or its possible future, would people begin to relate to them in the same way-a sort of speculative material culture, fictional archeology, or imaginary anthropology?For many designers, there is a natural tendency to view museums and galleries in a negative light as inaccessible and elitist places to show design., LINE: 621, BOOK: Speculative Everything by Anthony Dunne, KEYWORD: enact form window shop tri thing mind imagin effort also scope individu interpret rather look back time peopl fiction artifact altern version societi possibl futur would peopl begin relat way sort specul materi cultur fiction imaginari anthropolog mani design natur tendenc view museum galleri neg light inaccess place show design

TEXT:  The projects brought a new perspective to the research by offering creative interpretations of these new scientific ideas. In Phantom Recorder (2010) by Revital Cohen, a collaboration with Cambridge Centre for Brain Repair, medical research into improving the interface between a person's nervous system and a prosthetic limb served as the starting point for a more poetic application of medical technology., LINE: 648, BOOK: Speculative Everything by Anthony Dunne, KEYWORD: project brought new perspect research offer creativ interpret new scientif idea phantom record collabor brain repair medic research improv interfac person nervou system prosthet limb start point poetic applic medic technolog
TEXT:  When a limb is lost the mind often develops a unique phantom sensation. It could be an extension, an addition, or just a replacement. The technology being researched by the Cambridge team could, theoretically, allow for the sensation to be recorded and played back later, allowing the person to retain an imaginary but important sensation., LINE: 649, BOOK: Speculative Everything by Anthony Dunne, KEYWORD: limb lost mind often uniqu phantom sensat could extens addit replac technolog team could theoret allow sensat back later person retain imaginari import sensat

TEXT:  This is particularly challenging for designers because we are usually on the wrong side of spectacle, helping construct ones that encourage people to consume more. Can speculative design take on a social and possibly political role, combining the poetic, critical, and progressive by applying excessively imaginative thinking to seriously large scale issues? Although operating at a systemic level, large-scale speculative thinking is different from design thinking and social design., LINE: 692, BOOK: Speculative Everything by Anthony Dunne, KEYWORD: particularli design usual wrong side spectacl help construct one encourag peopl consum specul design take social possibl polit role combin poetic critic progress excess imagin think serious larg scale issu although oper system level larg scale specul think differ design think social design
