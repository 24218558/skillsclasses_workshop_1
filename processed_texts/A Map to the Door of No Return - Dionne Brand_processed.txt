TEXT: Dedicatedto the other dwellers of the doorContents Cover Other Books by This Author Title Page Copyright Dedication First Page Acknowledgements Selected Reading A Note on the AuthorThere are maps to the Door of No Return. The physical door. They are well worn, gone over by cartographer after cartographer, refined from Ptolemy’s Geographia to orbital photographs and magnetic field imaging satellites. But to the Door of No Return which is illuminated in the consciousness of Blacks in the Diaspora there are no maps. This door is not mere physicality. It is a spiritual location. It is also perhaps a psychic destination. Since leaving was never voluntary, return was, and still may be, an intention, however deeply buried. There is as it says no way in; no return., LINE: 7, BOOK: A Map to the Door of No Return - Dionne Brand, KEYWORD: dweller cover book author titl page copyright dedic first page select read note map door return physic door well worn gone cartograph cartograph refin orbit photograph magnet field satellit door return illumin conscious black map door mere physic spiritu locat also perhap psychic destin sinc leav wa never voluntari return wa still may intent howev deepli buri say way return

TEXT:  He raised his Sunday Guardian newspaper to block my view. He shooed me away, telling me to find some book to read or work to do. At times it seemed as if Papa was on the brink of remembering.

TEXT:  I recall waking up each day to discover what it had brought us, and what it had carried away. The word gaze only applies to water.

TEXT:  To live in the Black Diaspora is I think to live as a fiction — a creation of empires, and also self-creation. It is to be a being living inside and outside of herself.

TEXT:  Leaving? To leave? Left? Language can be deceptive. The moment when they “left” the Old World and entered the New. Forced to leave? To “leave” one would have to have a destination in mind.

TEXT:  There is no answer. The Door of No Return is ajar between them. I can see its impossibility. They are as in an old remembered attitude. Gates, in all his other explorations of the continent, is the quintessential American traveller, oohing and ahing about wonders, skeptical about claims of civilization, lecturing about civilization, fearful about being in Africa, revelling in the occasional familiarity and pointing out dissimilarity wisely., LINE: 145, BOOK: A Map to the Door of No Return - Dionne Brand, KEYWORD: answer door return ajar see imposs old attitud gate explor contin quintessenti travel wonder skeptic claim civil civil fear occasion familiar point dissimilar wise
TEXT:  But here, faced at last with the man from Kumasi, he asks a childlike question to which there is no answer. 3 Not a few in our Country fondly imagine that Parents here sell their Children, Men their Wives, and one Brother the other: But those who think so deceive themselves; for this never happens on any other account but that of Necessity, or some great Crime: But most of the Slaves that are offered to us are Prisoners of War, which are sold by the Victors as their Booty., LINE: 146, BOOK: A Map to the Door of No Return - Dionne Brand, KEYWORD: face last man childlik question answer countri fondli imagin parent sell child men wife one brother think deceiv never account necess great crime slave prison war sold victor booti

TEXT:  The Black body is situated as a sign of particular cultural and political meanings in the Diaspora. All of these meanings return to the Door of No Return — as if those leaping bodies, those prostrate bodies, those bodies made to dance and then to work, those bodies curdling under the singing of whips, those bodies cursed, those bodies valued, those bodies remain curved in these attitudes., LINE: 156, BOOK: A Map to the Door of No Return - Dionne Brand, KEYWORD: black bodi situat sign particular cultur polit mean mean return door return leap bodi prostrat bodi bodi made danc work bodi sing whip bodi curs bodi valu bodi remain curv attitud

TEXT:  We all enter those bodies. The Black body is a domesticated space as much as it is a wild space. It is domesticated in the sense that there are set characteristics ascribed to the body which have the effect of familiarizing people with it — making it a kind of irrefutable common sense or knowledge., LINE: 158, BOOK: A Map to the Door of No Return - Dionne Brand, KEYWORD: enter bodi black bodi space much wild space sens set characterist bodi effect peopl make kind irrefut common sens knowledg

TEXT:  The many permutations and inversions of the original captivity leach into the contemporary popular discourse and the common sense. These captives, the contemporary young people in orange overalls, give off the essence of danger, of emotions out of control which have to be suppressed, of a violence, if not put under control, which will come down like a flood on the whole of society., LINE: 165, BOOK: A Map to the Door of No Return - Dionne Brand, KEYWORD: mani permut invers origin captiv leach contemporari popular discours common sens captiv contemporari young peopl orang overal give essenc danger emot control suppress violenc put control come like flood whole societi

TEXT:  Looking at Black Entertainment Television’s Midnight Love, a music video show, I notice the extreme sexualizing of both the male and the female Black body.

TEXT:  What can be inferred here is that Isabella led a fabulous religious fantasy life. To see herself and Ferdinand at this occasion attests to the fertility of her imagination. But perhaps it was Juan de Flandes’ attempt to ingratiate himself further with Isabella of Castille; perhaps he said to her one day, “Dearest Queen, this scene would be nothing without you., LINE: 563, BOOK: A Map to the Door of No Return - Dionne Brand, KEYWORD: led fabul religi fantasi life see occas fertil imagin perhap wa attempt ingrati perhap said one day queen scene would noth without

TEXT:  A way of surviving apartheid’s ruthless violence. The victory over apartheid seemed to free Coetzee to realism, to more plain terms about race.

TEXT:  It turned Coetzee’s style from allegory to a kind of journalism. As I read Disgrace, these thoughts come to me.

TEXT:  To enter Coetzee’s earlier work was to enter that odd trope, the “universal,” the “human.” At least some of us could. Others of us who saw a less noble and more vulgar world may have been untouched. Or may have, being more cynical, read that trope as “white”; or may have read the helplessness of his characters as luxury and, more telling, may have read his characters’ inaction as hardly remarkable., LINE: 601, BOOK: A Map to the Door of No Return - Dionne Brand, KEYWORD: enter work wa enter odd trope univers human least could saw less nobl vulgar world may untouch may cynic read trope white may read helpless charact luxuri tell may read charact inact hardli remark

TEXT:  For me, Coetzee’s narratives, for all their universality, could not contest or enlighten the other narratives emanating from South Africa.

TEXT:  At once he cut his hair and dressed like Sam Cooke, then he enforced the proper use of English and berated the use of the demotic. So you see, reading is full of complications.

TEXT:  In a society so invested in its “inherent goodness” and moral superiority, Morrison’s voice is always trenchant.

TEXT:  I notice that Coetzee awkwardly collapses the so-called “political correctness” of feminism with that of post-apartheid “black rule.” The committee of inquiry is racially marked by their names revealing a strange assortment of “modern” and ascendant interests — Blacks, Asians, aspiring women and a token holdover from the past., LINE: 615, BOOK: A Map to the Door of No Return - Dionne Brand, KEYWORD: notic awkwardli collaps polit correct femin post apartheid black rule committe inquiri racial mark name reveal strang assort modern ascend interest black aspir woman token holdov past

TEXT:  The whole world.” Morrison’s America is the painful void of the Diaspora. Paradise is about the nature of blackness.

TEXT:  I plead guilty to both charges. Pass sentence, and let us get on with our lives.” He refuses repentance or contrition. It is probably true, I think as I stretch my body across four seats in the middle aisle, that repentance or contrition or a going over of the story or even any attempts at the truth may not be sufficient for the atrocities of apartheid., LINE: 621, BOOK: A Map to the Door of No Return - Dionne Brand, KEYWORD: plead guilti charg sentenc let get life refus repent contrit probabl true think stretch bodi across four seat middl aisl repent contrit go stori even attempt truth may suffici atroc apartheid
TEXT:  I have a mind that these may be the preoccupations of victims. The “why” that wracks them even more than the “who.” Lurie rather dramatically compares the committee’s procedures to Mao’s China with its “recantation, self-criticism, public apology., LINE: 622, BOOK: A Map to the Door of No Return - Dionne Brand, KEYWORD: mind may preoccup victim wrack even rather dramat compar committe procedur mao china recant self critic public apolog
TEXT: ” So it seems that Disgrace rejects a communal remedy or any possibility of change. And this is where I find the novel ultimately pessimistic.

TEXT:  Lurie’s movement to some understanding about his place in the universe only comes through the work he begins doing in a clinic that euthanizes stray dogs and cats.

TEXT:  Allegory again? And again the daily narratives make allegory obsolete. The big question here is — up in the sky where the big questions can be pondered — is Coetzee saying that for white South Africans there is no meaningful or moral survival without apartheid? Is he saying that apartheid is as much social system as physical body; is he saying that whites are irredeemable? I’m about to fall into one of those disturbed sleeps one falls into on airplanes., LINE: 625, BOOK: A Map to the Door of No Return - Dionne Brand, KEYWORD: allegori daili narr make allegori obsolet big question sky big question say white south meaning moral surviv without apartheid say apartheid much social system physic bodi say white irredeem fall one disturb sleep one fall airplan
TEXT:  Now it is amplified by Coetzee’s dread. In the gaps of waking and sleeping, I plummet into the middle of Paradise. There, there is an exquisite chapter called “Divine.” It opens at a wedding with a sermon on love which you are drawn into like being drawn stunningly into hell, well, into clarity., LINE: 626, BOOK: A Map to the Door of No Return - Dionne Brand, KEYWORD: dread gap wake sleep plummet middl paradis exquisit chapter divin open wed sermon love drawn like drawn stunningli hell well clariti
TEXT:  “God is not interested in you,” declares the preacher. Here Morrison suggests that life in the Diaspora can’t be put right, the imagination cannot suffice — not on love, not on grace, not on exile. Not on any thing that she can imagine at this moment anyway., LINE: 627, BOOK: A Map to the Door of No Return - Dionne Brand, KEYWORD: god interest preacher life put right imagin cannot suffic love grace exil thing imagin moment anyway
TEXT:  The bride is a girl with a torn heart. Why do I find this chapter “exquisite” then? Is it my own sense of hopelessness and doom? Does Morrison confirm my dread?

TEXT:  I do not know among us who identified with the lady and who with the gamekeeper. The book’s gendering could not have been seamless.

TEXT:  I only had a few lines shared with a few girls. Books leave gestures in the body; a certain way of moving, of turning, a certain closing of the eyes, a way of leaving, hesitations.

TEXT:  Writing is an act of desire, as is reading. Why does someone enclose a set of apprehensions within a book? Why does someone else open that book if not because of the act of wanting to be wanted, to be understood, to be seen, to be loved?

TEXT:  For some, to find beauty is to search through ruins. For some of us beauty must be made over and over again out of the sometimes fragile, the sometimes dangerous.

TEXT:  He was someone in his own gesture, the thing that writers envy. It is clever and cold, edgy, and it belonged to him. To desire then, to read and translate, may also be to envy, to want to become. What is it that I wanted to pour myself into — his grief, his cold sweat, his life uncertain of its next step? And I wanted to do it only for the moment it took to put it on a page, to feel its texture, and then to run back quickly to my uncomplicated hotel room and my as-yet-uncomplicated page., LINE: 952, BOOK: A Map to the Door of No Return - Dionne Brand, KEYWORD: wa someon gestur thing writer envi clever cold edgi desir read translat may also envi want becom pour grief cold sweat life uncertain next step moment took put page feel textur run back quickli uncompl hotel room yet uncompl page
TEXT:  To desire may also be to complicate. I want to say something else about desire. I really do not know what it is.

But the records of what and how are in the living, in our habits, our tastes, our styles — a sweet tooth, a love of starchy foods, a sudden hatred of fields, a desire for big cities, an insistent need for loud colours, beautiful shoes, excesses of all kinds whether we can afford them or not., LINE: 999, BOOK: A Map to the Door of No Return - Dionne Brand, KEYWORD: lodg poorli made transient noth left perhap good forget crucial condit live peac record live habit tast style sweet tooth love starchi food sudden hatr field desir big citi insist need loud colour beauti shoe excess kind whether afford

Père Labat’s sanguine account of all this, his own travels and business dealings, the ways of planters, the workings of capital machines, his fascination with and disdain for the rituals of the indigenous peoples, his enthusiasm for the whole matter of colonizing, makes you understand just how plain and ordinary this all was, how commonplace and regular — and not in the least bit extraordinary — brutality and exploitation are., LINE: 1009, BOOK: A Map to the Door of No Return - Dionne Brand, KEYWORD: good businesswoman accord die without novic nun priest claim estat sanguin account travel busi deal way planter work capit machin fascin disdain ritual indigen peopl enthusiasm whole matter make understand plain ordinari wa commonplac regular least bit extraordinari brutal exploit
